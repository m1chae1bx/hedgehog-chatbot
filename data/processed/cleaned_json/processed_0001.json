But there's also David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, up about 1.6 percent and Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management, up 3.7 percent, to name a few. \nThat compares with a 19.4 percent jump in the S&P 500 , an 8.5 percent gain in HFR's weighted composite index of hedge-fund returns, and a 4 percent gain in HFR's index of activist investors. \nHedge-fund activists typically manage concentrated portfolios, buying enough stock to push for changes at their selected target companies. Activist campaigns typically aim to remake boards with new directors or push for larger transformations like a sale or CEO change. Their leverage stems from the potential for a proxy fight \u2014 the activist appeals to shareholders to elect their own nominees to a company's board. \nBut with a long-biased strategy that's equity-focused, how did these stars manage to underperform so dramatically in 2017? Part of it has to do with stock picking. And part of it has to do with size. \n\"They have such large amounts of capital at their disposal that they had to invest a certain amount of money, which led them to a certain market cap,\" said Josh Black, editor of Activist Insight. \"Generally to win support from the institutional investor community, you have to be focused on operations or something that can enhance long-term value, rather than a short-term breakup or capital allocation.\" \nTake Trian, for example. As of the end of the third quarter, the firm had only eight long positions, according to its quarterly regulatory filing. All but two were stakes worth more than $1 billion. One of those was General Electric , a stock that was down about 45 percent during 2017. \nNot counting GE, Trian was up about 10 percent for the year, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. That still fell short of the gain in the S&P. \nIt was a similar story with Greenlight, which has long and short stakes, or bets that a stock will drop. The firm said its \"bubble basket\" of short positions -- including Amazon , Athenahealth, Netflix and Tesla -- dragged down returns for the firm. Instead of falling, the stocks rose. \nAckman has been undergoing a unique set of challenges. Pershing took a $4 billion loss on its stake in Valeant Pharmaceuticals. A Pershing short, Herbalife, gained 41 percent, while Chipotle, in which Pershing Square is long, plummeted 23 percent. \nAs a result, Ackman is refocusing the firm, announcing last Friday that he would be laying off 10 people -- one investment professional and the rest from the operational side of the firm, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Reuters earlier reported the layoffs. Ackman plans to spend more time investing and less time marketing in the new year, the person said. \nJana Partners' activist strategy is a bit more nuanced. The firm, led by Barry Rosenstein, has a main fund that's only about one-third invested in an activist-oriented strategy and produced a return of about 5.6 percent in 2017. \nJana also has a fund, with about $1.5 billion in capital, that focuses on activism and that was up about 22 percent, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. \nThird Point's Dan Loeb produced returns of 18.1 percent last year, according to a letter obtained by CNBC. Loeb credits the performance to a switch he began in 2009 from generalist analysts to sector or asset-class specialists. That includes a specialist short-selling team, which posted absolute returns of 13 percent. \nUnlike his star-powered peers, Loeb didn't wage any major activist pushes in 2017, aside from some public comments about Nestle. But Trian essentially tied a proxy fight at P&G (and P&G ultimately gave him the board seat after several rounds of recounts), Pershing Square lost its fight at ADP and Greenlight lost its fight at General Motors. \nUp-and-coming and lesser known activists were able to produce better results, by and large. Marcato, led by Mick McGuire, generated 25.6 percent returns last year. Voce Capital, led by Dan Plants, jumped 19 percent, while Scott Ferguson's Sachem Head and Jonathan Litt's Land & Buildings each returned about 13 percent."}

Jan 3, 2018; San Jose, CA, USA; Bradie Tennell performs in the 2018 Prudential U.S. Figure Skating Championships at SAP Center. Mandatory Credit: Stan Szeto-USA TODAY Sports \nUnder the microscope of the Olympic selectors in the last event before the team for Pyeongchang is picked, in-form teenager Tennell executed flawlessly in San Jose, California. \nTennell arrived at the championships as one to watch after finishing third at Skate America last month and she did not disappoint, notching the highest ever U.S. championships short program score of 73.79 points, ahead of Nagasu\u2019s 73.09. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know that,\u201d the 19-year-old said in a post-routine interview. \u201cMy expectations were just to skate a clean program. I just ignored the whole Olympics aspect of it and skated how I know how.\u201d \nNagasu, meanwhile, failed to stick her signature jump in a nervous start to what she hopes will be Olympic redemption but still recovered to challenge Tennell. \nThe 24-year-old wept openly after being overlooked for the 2014 American team for Sochi, despite finishing third at the U.S. championships that year. \nFour years after that crushing disappointment, Nagasu entered this year\u2019s championships with the distinction of being only the second American after Tonya Harding to land a triple Axel in international competition. \nAfter a nervous warm-up, Nagasu started her routine with the triple Axel but stumbled upon landing, although she stayed on her feet. She regrouped, however, and was rewarded with the highest technical score of the night. \n\u201cI think I did a great job. To go down in history is all I\u2019ve ever wanted,\u201d said Nagasu, who makes no secret of her desire to atone for 2014. \n\u201cI wish I had the mental ability of (multiple gold medal-winning swimmer) Michael Phelps but I think my journey has been about getting up... I\u2018m so proud to still be here today.\u201d \nTennell and Nagasu are well clear of third-placed Karen Wang on 69.48, with triple national champion Ashley Wagner languishing down in fifth place on 65.94. \n\u201cI\u2019ve head a really mental season, I\u2018m not going to lie about that,\u201d said Wagner, referring to her recent mediocre form. \n\u201cThis was solid. You can lose an event in the short program and my main focus was to get through this, not get too far behind and get myself a close enough distance to make a real killing in the long.\u201d \nThe ladies\u2019 event concludes on Friday with the long program. \nThe first three finishers are not guaranteed of selection, as Nagasu discovered in 2014, but know a strong finish will be hard to ignore.

Kennedy (JFK) International Airport. \nLost luggage? Missed connection? Downgraded ? Perhaps the fastest way to reach your airline is over social media. \nAirlines often respond to passengers faster on social media, where customers air their travel troubles to their airline and the public, than over the phone. \nSocial media has exposed what goes on on airplanes to millions of people, and image-conscious airlines are aware how quickly incidents can go viral. Think of the violent dragging of a United Airlines passenger off a flight last April or Ann Coulter's feud with Delta Air Lines over a seat assignment change. \nMost traveler comments (yes, sometimes customers are there to offer a compliment) are routine travel issues: delays, lost items, or cancellations. @ British_Airways Never easy to leave sunny PHX for rainy LHR but excellent crew on BA288 7 Jan made it much easier. Thank you! Now can you do something about the weather, please? ;-) \nThe time it takes for airlines to respond varies, but some passengers get a response in less than five minutes, according to a new study by Conversocial, a customer service consulting firm. 6.5 hours of flight to LAS and WiFi won't be available. @Delta - how could you do that to me?!? :)) Seems like emails are going to wait a bit :) \nJetBlue received the highest marks among North American airlines for its response speed, taking an average four minutes and 50 seconds to reply to passengers on Twitter. United came in last at one hour and 34 minutes, far lower than the average of about 20 minutes. The airline had more social media mentions per hour than other North American airlines, the study said. \n\"We recognize that oftentimes social media is the most convenient way for customers to interact with us and we are continuing to work hard on a daily basis to improve our response time,\" a spokeswoman said, adding that the airline plans to increase its social media staffing team by more than 150 percent by the end of March. @ AnnCoulter Additionally, your insults about our other customers and employees are unacceptable and unnecessary \nAmong European and Middle Eastern airlines, Finnair took the longest to respond to Twitter mentions: more than five and a half hours, the study said. The Helsinki-based airline wasn't immediately available for comment. Germany's Lufthansa had the fastest response time at 9 minutes and 15 seconds. Checked our bags with @ united no one has seen them since. That was 4 days ago. Great work. \nAirlines receive thousands of mentions online and don't respond to even half of them. Conversocial analyzed mentions of airlines' Twitter handles between Oct. 5-8. American Airlines scored highest among North American carriers, followed by Delta at 31 percent. \nSometimes when air travel goes awry, such as in the wake of a storm, social media won't cut it because such large numbers of travelers are in need of assistance. Following a powerful winter storm, Delta had set up a hotline for passengers whose trips were disrupted at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, after bottlenecks stranded thousands. But passengers upset about about the hotline's long hold times Leslie Josephs Airline Reporter for CNBC.com Related Securities"}

{"published":"2018-01-03T23:01:00.000+02:00","title":"Graphic: New Year bounce extends palladium's rally to record high","text":"LONDON (Reuters) - Palladium extended last year\u2019s more than 50 percent surge to hit record highs on Tuesday, as Chinese car sales growth, tightening emissions controls and a swing away from diesel cars in Europe fueled fears of a metal shortage after years of market deficit.\nSpot palladium hit a peak of $1,096.50 an ounce on Tuesday, just above its 2001 high of $1,095 an ounce.\nA switch to gasoline-powered and hybrid cars, which use more palladium in their autocatalysts, has fueled fears that market tightness could lead to a shortage of supply. The market has been in deficit in six out of the last seven years for which data is available.\nThat shortfall has led to a draw-down of available stocks. Holdings of palladium-backed exchange-traded funds fell to their lowest since 2010 last year, with some analysts citing market tightness, which they say drew physical metal out of the funds.\nPalladium, some three-quarters of which is used in catalytic converters, chiefly for gasoline engines, hit a series of 17-year highs in 2017 on expectations that automotive demand would continue to improve.\n\u201cUnderlying the speculative investment flows is a very strong fundamental picture,\u201d ICBC Standard Bank analyst Tom Kendall said. \u201cPalladium is one of the few metals markets that is genuinely tight and looks like it will continue to tighten.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you overlay the growth in car sales in China, which is a gasoline market, with the ongoing switch away from diesel in Europe, it adds up to a much better demand story for palladium than for platinum,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is drawing down inventories, and there is no easy supply response.\u201d\nDiesel market share in Europe has been under pressure since carmaker Volkswagen admitted in 2015 that it had used illegal software to cheat U.S. emissions tests, slipping below 50 percent the following year for the first time since 2009.\nMeanwhile, Chinese car sales growth held firm in 2017.\nWhile there are solid reasons for palladium\u2019s move, analysts said the strength of its recent gains suggests it may be overstretched in the near term. The metal eased 1 percent on Wednesday, though it remains at elevated levels.\n\u201cThe fundamentals are strong, it\u2019s true, and this is spilling over into continued tight physical availability which is reflected in the outright price and a deeply backwardated forward market,\u201d Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler said, referring to the higher price of palladium contracts for imminent delivery versus the more distant future.\n\u201cBut this has the mark of a spec squeeze especially given (Tuesday\u2018s) thin trading, right at the start of the year with many market participants still enjoying holidays.\u201d\nIn the longer term, there are clear risks to the rally. Palladium\u2019s heavy reliance on car sales for demand - unlike platinum, its jewellery market is small - could make it vulnerable to a sharp retracement if signs emerge that sales are slowing.\nA move towards vehicle electrification would also cut down demand for catalytic converters. However, that is too far off to pose a significant risk the market at present, Kendall said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is within anyone\u2019s ability to take a commodities investment position on e-vehicles yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many unknowns.\u201d\nIn the meantime, market tightness has sent the metal back to levels not seen since 2001, a time when U.S. carmakers were panicking over the U.S. authorities\u2019 shift in emphasis to tackling unburned hydrocarbon emissions, GFMS\u2019 head of research and forecasts Rhona O\u2018Connell said. This rally looks more solid, she said.\n\u201cThis time around it\u2019s genuine fundamentals (that are driving the rally), and some spec activity, in the belief that the pressure on diesel will favor gasoline,\u201d she said.\nTo view a graphic on Palladium market balance vs price, click: reut.rs\/2CbLOvG\nTo view a graphic on Palladium automotive demand vs price, click: reut.rs\/2CFs4BF\nTo view a graphic on Chinese car sales vs palladium, click: reut.rs\/2CJgJRa\nTo view a graphic on Metals performance 2017:, click: reut.rs\/2CipuUw\nReporting by Jan Harvey; Editing by Veronica Brown and Mark Potter\n "}

Korea's Amorepacific bets on luxury cosmetics for Europe push Reuters Staff \n* Amorepacific began selling in France in 2017 \n* Aims to draw customers with herbal-inspired formulas \n* Rival South Korean firms also working on Europe business \nBy Sarah White and Pascale Denis \nPARIS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - South Korean cosmetics company Amorepacific aims to expand in Europe by launching one of its luxury brands in Britain this year and in Germany in 2019, after introducing its products in France in 2017, a senior executive said. \nAmorepacific, South Korea\u2019s biggest beauty firm, began selling its luxury Sulwhasoo brand of creams and other cosmetic products in Galeries Lafayette department store in Paris in September. \nThierry Maman, the head of the group\u2019s European operations, said its products should reach British department stores, such as Selfridges, this year, with Germany to follow after that. \nMaman, hired by Amorepacific in 2015 from the perfume and beauty arm of LVMH\u2019s Givenchy, said the Paris outlet was \u201ca good testing ground\u201d as the label considered whether to open its own stores or offer its products through other shops. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t become international from one day to the next,\u201d he said. \nThe group first tried to break into the French cosmetics market, one of the world\u2019s most competitive, 30 years ago but withdrew after just two years due to poor sales. It bought French perfume house Annick Goutal in 2011. \nMaman said France was a tough market but added Sulwhasoo was betting on drawing customers with its traditional, herbal-inspired formulas. \nSouth Korean beauty products, which have expanded in Asia and especially China, have gained a reputation for innovation and using natural ingredients, such as snail slime or tea leaves. \nOther Korean firms have attracted foreign investors and pushed into Europe, such as Dr.Jart+, partly backed by Estee Lauder and whose products are sold in the beauty chain Sephora. \nRivals often offer cheaper ranges of skincare or make-up products, which are particularly popular with young consumers. \nAmorepacific, whose products include a sponge applicator for make-up that has been mimicked by global brands like L\u2018Oreal\u2019s Lancome, might offer more of its middle-of-the-range labels to Europe in future, Maman said. \nAmorepacific\u2019s European revenues, including Goutal, were less than 50 million euros ($60.2 million) annually but were expected to rise by 20 percent in 2018, Maman said. \nAmorepacific\u2019s sales were hit this year by diplomatic tensions with China that reduced Chinese tourists to South Korea. \nRelations are now on the mend, but Amorepacific Corp\u2019s sales fell 8 percent to about 4 trillion won ($3.8 billion) in the year to September. \n($1 = 0.8300 euros)"}

Tesla unveiled the product in October 2016 as it sought to acquire solar installer SolarCity.\nAt that time, Tesla said the product could be rolled out as soon as the summer of 2017. In November, Tesla founder Elon Musk said the product was going through a six-month testing process, saying \u201cit just takes a little while to get this behemoth rolling.\u201d\nMore than a dozen Tesla employees, including Musk and Chief Technical Officer JB Straubel, had the solar roofs installed on their homes last year as part of an initial pilot program.\nTesla started taking orders for the solar roof tiles in May by asking homeowners to put down a $1,000 deposit via its web site. Tesla would not disclose how many reservations it had received for the solar roof. The product will be installed on some customer rooftops in the coming months.\nThe company has said its solar roofs would cost between 10 and 15 percent less than an ordinary new roof plus traditional solar panels.\nTesla is collaborating with its longstanding battery partner, Japan\u2019s Panasonic Corp, to manufacture solar products at the Buffalo factory. There are about 500 employees working at the site currently, Tesla said.\nThe companies began production of traditional solar panels at the site last year, but they have not yet been installed on rooftops. The company said it will achieve more than 1 gigawatt of cell and module production in Buffalo, and possibly as much as double that, but gave no timeline for meeting the target.\nTesla said its primary focus is increasing production of its Model 3 sedan. The company said last week it would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s a week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised.\nReporting by Nichola Groom; editing by Diane Craft\n "}

Some entrepreneurs express concern and fear, while others carry on with business as usual. \nBut one thing insiders agree on is the move will make it more difficult for cannabis companies to find and secure banking relationships, without which businesses are left with a ton of cash on hand. \nDespite being legal for recreational or medicinal use in more than half the country, marijuana is still a Schedule I drug and therefore illegal at the federal level. In 2013, Barack Obama 's administration issued the Cole Memorandum, which essentially directed federal law enforcement to allow businesses that are legal under state laws to operate. The memo also signaled banks could do business with these companies so long as they were in compliance with federal guidelines, although many have been hesitant. \nIn rescinding this policy, Sessions said future prosecutions of businesses and individuals who sell pot in states where it has been legalized will be left up to individual U.S. attorneys. \n\"The real sticking point here will be banking. Before, banks were very reluctant to do business based on the loosely defined Cole Memo,\" said Matt Karnes, founder of industry analyst firm GreenWave Advisors. \"This raises more uncertainty, and I think there is going to be a pullback.\" \nIn a November 2017 report, GreenWave found that about 5 percent, or 368, of all financial institutions in the U.S. are on record with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), but only 1 percent are actually servicing these businesses. Many are credit unions and local and community banks. Karnes also said many marijuana businesses conceal the true nature of their business when establishing relationships, and once they are found out, the account is shut down. \n\"In the last report from FinCEN, 3,800 accounts were opened, but 3,700 were shut down. It's very short-lived,\" he said. \nA report from Reuters Wednesday also indicated the action taken by Sessions came as a surprise to FinCEN, which was flooded with calls from banks on how to proceed. CNBC reached out to both the Department of Justice and FinCEN for comment but did not immediately receive a response. Boom for security businesses? \nMore cash on hand for the foreseeable future means ancillary companies that specialize in security but don't touch the plant may see an increase in business. \nDallas-based Sapphire Risk Advisory Group offers security solutions for more than 100 cannabis companies in 18 states and Canada. Managing partner Tony Gallo said he received calls from clients old and new in the past week seeking advice and new business in the wake of Sessions' action. \n\"Our clients are concerned about whether their security is adequate at this time in their locations, whether it's a grow facility or dispensary. And then new clients that are looking to come on board wanted to know what kind of security they're going to be required to have going forward,\" Gallo said. \nGallo anticipates banks will further retreat, which means his business stands to benefit. About 70 percent of the businesses he works with have banking relationships, he said. \n\"I think the banking and insurance industries have been very hesitant to conduct business in the cannabis arena prior to the Cole Memo coming out, and I think they will continue to be. It will probably get worse. That then sends messages to bad people that these locations will have a large amount of cash on hand,\" he said. \"That's the concern a lot of our clients had \u2014 safeguarding their cash now that they may have trouble going to the bank.\" Industry still primed for growth \nOne thing that hasn't shifted since Sessions' action are the growth projections firms have put forward for the industry. \nMarijuana Business Daily estimates medicinal and recreational sales will hit $6 billion in the U.S. this year and will triple in the next four to five years, fueled primarily by a new recreational market in California. \nThe more bullish GreenWave is projecting $12.8 billion this year and more than $30 billion by 2021, assuming there is a medicinal or recreational market in every state nationwide. Both groups said they are not changing their projections just yet. \n\"Basically you have a freight train moving at 200 miles per hour, and Jeff Sessions is trying to jump out of a bush and stick out his leg to slow this down,\" said Chris Walsh, vice president of editorial for Marijuana Business Daily. \"It is going to run him over. So I think it might have some type of a chilling effect in some areas, but in general, the industry is going to be moving and growing quickly and will continue to move forward.\""}

She said Prime Minister Theresa May must defend whatever trade option the UK government chose to pursue with hard evidence, damaging the economy as little as possible.\n\u201cThere is zero credible evidence to suggest leaving the Single Market will bring any benefit to our economy. Indeed, as our analysis will show \u2013 the harder the Brexit, the worse will be the outcome,\u201d Sturgeon said ahead of the publication of a study of the economic impact of Brexit on Scotland, commissioned by her government.\nMay is preparing for the start of talks about Britain\u2019s trade relationship with the EU once it is no longer a member.\nAgreeing a united stance has been made harder by infighting in May\u2019s cabinet and Conservative Party over their vision for the new relationship with the EU, while the biggest opposition party, Labour, is also split on the best way forward.\n\u201cIt will be a fundamental dereliction of duty as prime minister if Theresa May continues to pursue her \u2018red lines\u2019 without providing information on their impact, and publicly discussing the options available,\u201d Sturgeon said.\nSturgeon\u2019s party says continued single market membership would be the option that best reflects the fact that a majority of Scots vote in the 2016 referendum to stay in the EU.\nThat result put Scotland, together with Northern Ireland, at odds with Wales and England, which voted to leave, and the relationship between Britain\u2019s four nations has been under increased strain since.\nMay has indicated that ending freedom of movement of workers between Britain and the EU is a priority when Britain leaves.

Key results include:\nAdjusted operating earnings totaled $948 million, an 8 percent decrease against last year's strong comparative of $1.03 billion. For the first half, adjusted operating earnings stood at $1.84 billion, down 1 percent from last year. Net earnings for the quarter on a U.S. GAAP basis were $924 million, down 6 percent from $986 million a year ago. First-half net earnings increased 3 percent to $1.9 billion. Second-quarter revenues rose 8 percent to $29.2 billion, bringing the year-to-date figure to $56.5 billion.\n\"Even as conditions vary across our global markets, we continue to realize greater benefits from operating as an integrated company with a unique combination of talent, assets, insights and solutions,\" said David MacLennan, Cargill's chairman and chief executive officer.\nHe noted that during the quarter, the company announced more than $1 billion in agreed acquisitions, joint ventures and new investments in facilities. \"Thanks to the results of our recent strong performance, we are reinvesting in ways that enable our teams to achieve more for our customers and lead for growth.\"\nSegment results\nAdjusted operating earnings in Animal Nutrition & Protein narrowly exceeded last year's strong second quarter. Animal nutrition earnings rose across the global business, with improvement led by premix and feed additives. Protein results in North America decreased slightly against a strong comparative period. As cattle costs moved up, retail demand for beef remained brisk, as did exports of U.S. beef. Pre-season marketing by the U.S. turkey business drove whole-bird sales in advance of the Thanksgiving holiday. The segment's global poultry business trailed the year-ago quarter, as good performance in parts of Southeast Asia was offset by softer earnings elsewhere. In total, Animal Nutrition & Protein was the largest contributor to adjusted operating earnings in the second period.\nCargill completed several acquisitions in December that expand its focus on animal micro-nutrition. It purchased Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based Diamond V, a developer and manufacturer of natural feed additives, known as microbials, which improve animal health and performance by optimizing digestive function and immune strength. The acquisition complements Cargill's recently formed partnership with Austria's Delacon, a leading maker of natural, plant-based feed additives. Both investments support the market shift toward sustainable, natural feed ingredients that improve animal health and embrace changing consumer values.\nThe company also acquired Brazilian cattle feed producer Integral Animal Nutrition. It specializes in free-choice minerals that help grazing cattle meet their nutritional needs. Cargill bought full ownership of its premix joint venture in South Africa, which increases the company's presence in a region where protein demand is growing.\nIn poultry, Cargill is forming a joint venture with U.K.-based Faccenda Foods. Once completed, the venture will serve the country's food retailers and foodservice companies with fresh chicken, turkey and duck. With regard to organic growth, Cargill is investing $146 million in its cooked meats facility in Nashville, Tennessee. Acquired last year, the new outlay will double the plant's pizza toppings capacity and fund the construction of a pepperoni production facility. The two projects will come on line in mid-2018 and mid-2019, respectively.\nEarnings in Food Ingredients & Applications were up broadly, with a majority of the segment's food ingredient businesses posting good gains for the quarter. Cocoa and chocolate products, malts for brewers, distillers and food manufacturers, as well as sweeteners and starches for food and other applications led results in most regions. The segment's Asia-based businesses also contributed strongly to the quarter. Salt results decreased from the prior year, due in part to lower sales volume for deicing products after two mild North American winters. In addition to deicing and other industrial applications, the business serves food manufacturers with a wide range of salt ingredients and sodium reduction products.\nOrigination & Processing was down moderately from last year's second quarter, as another year of very large U.S. corn and soybean crops added to the buildup in global stocks. Although global demand continues to grow, today's abundant supplies have weighed on markets, diminishing volatility and trading opportunities. Even so, trading performance in North America was ahead of last year as was oilseed processing in Asia.\nThe segment is focused on deploying technologies that will better connect its global operations, enhance trading analytics and risk management, and increase supply chain sustainability \u2013 capabilities that bring additional value to customers. Supporting this effort are selective investments in new facilities. The company began constructing a $90 million biodiesel facility in Wichita, Kansas, marking its third such facility in the U.S. The new plant, which is set to open in early 2019, will allow Cargill to better serve biofuel producers in the Midwest and Southwest, and create an additional consumption flow for U.S. soybean production.\nResults in Industrial & Financial Services pulled ahead of the prior year, buoyed by increased returns from asset management investments as well as improved profits in ocean transportation. Trade and structured finance was up slightly against a strong comparative period; it provides financial solutions that facilitate trade and mitigate trade-related risks for companies doing business in emerging and developed markets. In late December, Cargill completed the sale of its U.S. metals business to Japanese steel trader and distributor Metal One. Cargill remains active in energy and ferrous markets through its biofuels, financial risk management, metals and shipping businesses.\nNew solutions for positive impact\nNumerous projects demonstrate how Cargill is advancing traceability and sustainability in supply chains. During the quarter, a pilot in the turkey business used blockchain technology to track Honeysuckle White\u00ae birds from the farm to Thanksgiving tables, providing consumers in select markets with information about the farms where individual animals were raised. In Canada, Cargill is launching a pilot to trace and verify a fully certified beef supply chain that meets the criteria for the Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef. Through the program, customers will receive fully audited beef, while farmers and ranchers will earn a financial credit for participating. And Cargill's cocoa business released its latest Cocoa Promise Report , celebrating five years of the Cargill Cocoa Promise that is helping ensure a vibrant cocoa sector for generations to come.\nCargill also is developing products that satisfy consumers' changing preferences for healthier, simpler foods. The first product in the new SimPure\u2122 line blends tapioca and potato starches to give food makers the same taste, texture, appearance and stability of modified starch with simplified, "}

{"published":"2018-01-04T04:25:00.000+02:00","title":"New SCOTUS brief: no circuit split on standing in data breach class actions","text":"(Reuters) - Circuit splits, like beauty, can be in the eye of the beholder.\nLast October, I told you about a petition for U.S. Supreme Court review by the health insurer CareFirst, which asked the justices to clarify constitutional standing requirements for plaintiffs exposed in corporate data breaches. CareFirst\u2019s lawyers at Eversheds Sutherland argued that the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which revived a data breach class action against the insurer, applied an overly permissive interpretation of constitutional standing requirements that is at odds with decisions by the 3rd, 4th and 8th Circuits, which have held that the mere theft of personal information does not give plaintiffs a right to sue.\nCareFirst said the lower courts are in such disarray that judges in different circuits have reached opposite conclusions in competing class actions stemming from the exact same data breach. \u201cLower courts have struggled to consistently apply Article III standing principles to future injuries allegedly caused by data theft, including the increased risk of future identity theft,\u201d its Supreme Court petition said. \u201cWithout guidance, courts, litigants, cybersecurity insurers and corporate America will remain uncertain as to when a federal court can hear such claims.\u201d\nOr not, according to a newly filed brief opposing Supreme Court review in the CareFirst case. The brief, by lawyers for the plaintiffs suing CareFirst, contends the much-ballyhooed ( by me , among others) circuit split on standing in data breach class actions is a mirage.\nIn fact, according to plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers from Paulson & Nace, Nidel & Nace and the Giatras Law Firm , the federal circuits all agree on how to interpret Supreme Court precedent on constitutional standing. The circuits may have reached different conclusions about standing in particular data breach class actions, the new brief said, but those conclusions were based on particular facts, not on the law.\n\u201cA review of these opinions does not demonstrate a split, but only that the courts are applying the facts to the appropriate precedent to weed out only those cases that do not meet the Article III standards the court has long identified,\u201d the new Supreme Court brief said. \u201cNot a single case cited by petitioners suggests a split on the legal issue.\u201d\nThe brief addressed three circuit court rulings that held data breach victims do not have standing based only on the theft of their personal information. The 3rd Circuit\u2019s 2011 decision in Reilly v. Ceridian predates the Supreme Court\u2019s latest precedent on standing and imminent threat of injury, 2013\u2019s Clapper v. Amnesty International and 2014\u2019s Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus. After the Supreme Court clarified the test for standing, the new brief said, the 3rd Circuit revised its analysis in a 2017 decision holding that plaintiffs in a data breach class action against Horizon Healthcare had standing based only on alleged violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\nSimilarly, the CareFirst plaintiffs said, the 4th Circuit held last year, in Wikimedia v. NSA that data misappropriation can confer constitutional standing, despite its earlier decision in Beck v. McDonald that the mere risk of identity theft is not concrete enough to give data breach victims standing to sue. And even in the Beck decision, the CareFirst plaintiffs\u2019 brief said, the 4th Circuit based its holding on the premise that no plaintiffs alleged their stolen data had actually been misused. That fact pattern distinguished the data breach class action at the 4th Circuit from the CareFirst case and others in which federal circuits have found the risk of identity theft sufficient to establish standing.\nFinally, the CareFirst plaintiffs\u2019 Supreme Court brief Quote: d the 8th Circuit\u2019s own language in 2017\u2019s In re SuperValu , which it concedes to be the best evidence of a split amongst the circuits on standing for data breach victims. But the big problem with that evidence, according to the opposition brief, is that the 8th Circuit said all of the circuit rulings \u201cultimately turned on the substance of the allegations before each court,\u201d so the different outcomes \u201cneed not\u201d be reconciled.\nComputer hackers have compromised personal information belonging to scores, if not hundreds, of millions of Americans. All of them are likely to be members of data breach class actions (whether they know it or not). So far, as I\u2019ve said many times, consumer class actions based on the theft of personal data have not produced big-money damages. But these cases affect more people than any other class actions I can think of.\nThe Supreme Court has already ducked a big class action issue this term, when it declined to take up the issue of ascertainability and class certification. The CareFirst plaintiffs seem to be banking on the court\u2019s disinclination to discern a circuit split when there may not actually be one.\nThe views expressed in this article are not those of Reuters News.\n "}

{"published":"2018-01-09T02:35:00.000+02:00","title":"Don't fight China: Just stop huge US wealth and technology transfers - commentary","text":"SHARES Jason Lee | Reuters China's President Xi Jinping claps after his speech as he and other new Politburo Standing Committee members meet with the press at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China October 25, 2017. \nIn the first 11 months of last year, China cashed in a cool $344.4 billion surplus on its U.S. trades. That's an 8 percent increase from the same period of 2016. \nFancy any technology with that? Of course, the Chinese would say. \nBeijing estimates that about 40 percent of its sales to the U.S. are generated by American companies operating in China. Those companies have been allowed to set up shop in China under joint-venture agreements requiring continuous technology transfers from the U.S. parent company. That's the only way exports from China could stay competitive in America's sophisticated consumer markets. \nThis briefly sums up the huge economic, political and security problems America created for itself with its wholesale outsourcing of manufacturing to China. \nAnd here is more: When the December trade numbers get in, the U.S. deficit with China for all of last year will probably end up close to $400 billion, a whopping 15 percent increase from 2016. \nIt will be interesting to hear what President Donald Trump will have to say about that because, in his long-held view, America was being ripped off by China. The irony is that the fiscal stimulus from Trump's tax reform will quickly drive China's trade surplus with the U.S. to half a trillion dollars. Don't blame China \nBut, sadly, that's now water under the bridge. A more interesting question would be to see how those trade surpluses are being used by China to strengthen its position as America's \"strategic competitor.\" \nThe numbers game there is very simple. The likely $400 billion China got from the U.S. last year will increase an already huge pool of Chinese net foreign assets and foreign currency reserves. At the last count, China's net foreign investment position stood at about $2 trillion, and its foreign reserves were at an astounding $3.14 trillion. That is by far the world's largest investment potential. \nAnd here is an example you might see this week of how those funds are used. \nRumors have it that the Chinese could pass an order of billions of dollars for Airbus planes to please the visiting French President Emmanuel Macron . That would grease the wheels of Sino-French relations, and it would set the right mood for a state visit Beijing considers as being of \"great significance.\" \nSome of that mood music has been played up already. In preparation for Macron's visit, the Chinese bought one more French jewel: Ch\u00e2teau Bellefont-Belcier, grand cru class\u00e9 in the wine region of Saint-Emilion. And to drink that in style, the Chinese also recently bought the world-famous Baccarat crystal company. \nBut China and France want to do more. Macron will be setting up an EU-China \"trade axis\" that will include Russia . That, in fact, represents an extension of the China-Russia agreement to integrate China's \"Belt and Road\" projects with development programs from the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union. \nIf you are keeping the \"strategic competition\" scores, chalk up a big one for China here. Some people call it a European stab in America's back, but as 19th Century French politician Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord famously said of betrayal: \"Sire, it is a question of date.\" \nBut let's go back to Asia. China is meeting this week some of its neighbors \u2014 Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam \u2014 for a Lancang-Mekong River Cooperation summit in Phnom-Penh, Cambodia, to plan big, China-led infrastructure \"connectivity\" projects. Beijing is extending its high-speed train lines to Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar Malaysia and Singapore. Don't get mad, get even \nChina is also building a $50 billion \"economic corridor\" in Pakistan , connecting Xinjiang to Arabian Sea port cities of Gwadar and Karachi with a network of highways and high-speed rail services. Pakistani ports are supposed to keep open China's access to the Middle East and Africa \u2014 and beyond \u2014 in case, as some Chinese strategists fear, the Straits of Malacca are blocked by the U.S. and its allies. \nThat Arabian Sea access is opening a key lane to China's strategic locations in the Mediterranean. The most important such point is the Greek port of Piraeus, the largest in South Europe, where China purchased a majority ownership for 280.5 million euros. That creates a springboard for billions of dollars of Chinese investments in high-speed rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe through Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary. \nAlong with the North Sea Route to Europe, jointly developed with Russia, those are all investments of great strategic importance to China. Closer to home, China also announced a number of similar \u2014 dual-use and military \u2014 investments last week. \nMore than 40 space launches are expected this year, including the heavy-lift Long March 5 rocket, far side Moon missions by Chang'e 4 lunar lander and rover, and new Beidou navigation satellites. \nThe country's armed forces, funded last year by an officially declared military budget of $215.7 billion, are now primed to get better and to win wars with power projection assets like aircraft carriers. The construction of a third such vessel is currently under way, and a total of four battle groups are planned over the next 10 years. \nLet's stop the litany here to see what all that means for Washington's dealings with its chief \"strategic competitor.\" \nFirst, a lesson should be drawn from a dreadfully wrong strategic assessment that promoted investments in China and opened American markets to goods and services from China's low-cost production facilities on the idea that the Middle Kingdom would soon shake off its Communist ideology to create a \"Chimerica\" wonderland \u2014 a capitalist, U.S.-compatible economic and political ally. \nSecond, that U.S. policy blunder allowed China to build a readily deployed treasure chest of more than $3 trillion, and an additional $2 trillion in short- and long-term international investments. \nThird, the U.S. should stop chasing after China's global initiatives. That is a useless waste of time and resources. Leave it to American defense experts to protect the country's security and its vital national interests. They have plenty of money and power projection instruments to do that. \nFourth, stay away from blatant trade protectionism and dumb protectionist rhetoric. Get a smart economic diplomacy by following World Trade Organization - and International Monetary Fund -compatible principles of fair and reciprocal trade to correct systematic (beggar-thy-neighbor) and excessive trade imbalances. \nHere is a hypothetical example of what that policy would do if the U.S.-China trade were to be balanced. Taking the trade numbers for the first 11 months of last year, such a trade equilibrium would imply tripling the current U.S. exports to China \u2014 if China insisted on exports of $460 billion to the U.S. Investment thoughts \nExports can be a powerful engine of U.S. economic growth. Based on data for the past seven years, a 1 percent increase in export volumes was associated with a 0.5 percent increase in GDP growth. \nIt follows, then, that a significant push toward a more balanced U.S.-China "}

REUTERS\/Jose Luis Gonzalez\/File Photo Trump in September ordered an Obama-era program that provided the young \u201cDreamer\u201d immigrants with work permits and prevented them from being deported to end in six months. The program is known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.\nDespite his order, the Republican president has vacillated in his view of the Dreamers. Young people brought to the United States as children illegally and raised and educated in the country, most of them have little or no experience of their parents\u2019 homelands in Latin America, Asia, Africa and elsewhere.\nSaving the Dreamers is a high priority for Democrats, but the issue has been swept up in other debates, including one on the wall that Trump wants to build along the U.S.-Mexico border.\nRepublican Senator John Cornyn, in a tweet on Friday, accused Democrats of trying to force a deal on Dreamers by doing a \u201cslow walk\u201d on efforts to approve critical disaster aid and defense spending.\nTwo other Republicans late on Thursday said both sides remained far apart. \u201cOur discussions on border security and enforcement with Democrats are much further apart, and that is key to getting a bipartisan deal on DACA,\u201d senators Thom Tillis and James Lankford said in a statement.\nDemocrats have said they are open to tying DACA to additional funding for border security technology. But they oppose Trump\u2019s wall, projected to cost over $21 billion.\nThe struggle over the Dreamers carries political weight for both parties heading into the November 2018 midterm congressional elections. Most of the Dreamers came from Mexico and Hispanics tend to vote for Democrats, who hope to gain seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives.\nRepublican lawmakers met with Trump at the White House on Thursday and initially emerged saying they were optimistic that they could find a legislative fix for DACA.\nOn Friday and Saturday, Trump and senior Republican congressional leaders are also likely to discuss the issue at a conference held at Camp David, the U.S. president\u2019s mountain retreat in Maryland.\nA meeting between leaders of both parties was set for Tuesday.\nCornyn, in an interview on Fox News on Friday, said Trump would demand that an immigration deal address the current visa lottery system and chain migration that unites family members.\n\u201cThose are things that he\u2019s insisted upon,\u201d and Democrats would have to embrace them along with border security, said Cornyn.\nAdditional reporting by Richard Cowan and Makini Brice; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Alistair Bell\n "}

Now, as Donald Trump's Washington nears a government shutdown, Republicans accuse Democrats of doing the same thing.\nThe 2011 debt crisis and 2013 government shutdown bear a surface similarity to the current impasse. In the first two, a Republican-controlled House demanded policy concessions in return for raising the federal debt limit and keeping the government open; now the Democratic minority wants concessions.\nBut the differences in circumstances outweigh the similarities \u2014 and not just because Republican now hold undivided control of the government. In reality, Democrats are not doing the same thing.\nIn 2011, having won control of the House the previous November, Republicans demanded massive spending cuts as a condition of preventing a government default. By the time Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell engineered an escape strategy, the U.S. suffered the first-ever downgrade of its credit rating.\nRepublicans eventually forced Obama and his party to accept massive spending cuts \u2014 but those cuts proved so much deeper than American voters would support that they've been rolled back. Republican leaders themselves no longer support them.\nIn 2013, Republicans forced a shutdown as part of their quest to wipe out Obamacare. Since Obama remained president and Democrats still controlled the Senate, they had no prospect of success.\nNor was public consensus behind them, though overall public opinion on Obamacare was marginally negative. As the shutdown dragged on, Americans blamed Republicans more than Democrats, and Republicans eventually surrendered.\nThus Republicans had twice halted government over objectives they lacked the political support and institutional power to sustain.\nThe current standoff is far different.\nGetty Images House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) answers questions on the possibility of a government shutdown at the U.S. Capitol on January 18, 2018 in Washington, DC. It originated with President Trump's proposal to roll back those cuts Republicans forced Democrats to accept in 2011 to provide roughly $50 billion more for the Pentagon. To offset that increase, the White House requested comparable cuts in nondefense spending.\nBut Republicans in Congress oppose the Republican president's requested cuts. Instead, they're negotiating with Democrats to increase nondefense spending, too.\nDemocrats don't control either chamber of Congress. But Republican leaders need some Democratic votes, at least in the Senate, to keep the government open. Democrats have made two major demands.\nOne is an extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program. The other is continued protection from deportation for the so-called dreamers in Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\nPolls show strong public support for both.\nOn Capitol Hill, CHIP has enjoyed bipartisan backing throughout its two-decade existence; Republican leaders themselves have vowed to extend it. Trump says he, like Democrats, wants to protect the dreamers so long as senators from both parties reach a bipartisan compromise on some other immigration issues.\nSenators reached that bipartisan compromise. But Trump is now rejecting it.\nThat's why Democratic senators \u2014 and some Republicans \u2014 have so far withheld votes needed to prevent a shutdown.\nIn other words, Republicans in 2011 and 2013 withheld votes in pursuit of goals that were divisive, partisan and quixotic. Democrats are withholding votes now in pursuit of popular goals embraced by both parties.\nThat reflects a core difference between the two parties. Overwhelmingly reliant on white voters, Republicans are more homogenous and ideologically zealous. Democrats are more diverse and interested in compromise.\nThe rank-and-file in both parties like it that way. In a 2014 NBC News\/Wall Street Journal poll that followed the Obama-era crises, Democrats said by 62 percent to 32 percent they preferred congressional candidates who would compromise. By 54 percent to 38 percent, Republicans preferred candidates who would stick to their positions.\nLast October, when the NBC\/WSJ poll asked the same question, Democrats responded the same way. Republicans' preference for hard-line views had slightly diminished amid the turbulence of Trump's opening months.\nWith a shutdown looming Saturday if the Senate fails to approve a temporary government funding bill, those divergent preferences pose a problem for Republicans in November's midterm elections. On a desire for compromise, independent voters side with Democrats."}

When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump said Bannon had little to do with his presidential victory in 2016 but was to blame for the loss of a Republican-held U.S. Senate seat in Alabama in December when accused child molester Roy Moore, who both Bannon and Trump had backed, lost to Democrat Doug Jones.\n\u201cNow that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn\u2019t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cSteve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well,\u201d Trump added.\nBannon expressed derision and astonishment over the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower in New York in which a Russian lawyer was said to be offering damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to the book \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d by Michael Wolff.\nIn the book, Bannon called the meeting that his son arranged and that Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, also attended \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d Bannon also was Quote: d as saying he was sure Trump Jr. would have taken the Russians who took part in the meeting to meet his father in Trump Tower.\nThe explosive comments from a former close aide and far-right architect of Trump\u2019s November 2016 election victory roiled the White House and the Republican president, who famously values loyalty in associates and employees.\n\u201cThe three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn\u2019t have any lawyers,\u201d Bannon said in the book in excerpts seen by Reuters.\n\u201cEven if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it\u2019s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.\u201d\nWhen an intermediary proposed the meeting, saying the Russians were offering damaging information about Clinton, Trump Jr. responded in an email, \u201cI love it.\u201d\nBannon was incredulous about the meeting shortly after it was revealed, according to the book, concluding sarcastically, \u201cThat\u2019s the brain trust they had.\u201d\nReporting by Steve Holland and Doina Chiacu; Additional reporting by Jim Oliphant; Editing by Will Dunham\n "}

Nigeria now joins Niger in organising bilateral returns. \n\u201cThe main objective, and we\u2019re very focused on that objective, is to get these Nigerian citizens back home as quickly as possible,\u201d Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyema told reporters during a visit to Tripoli. \n\u201dOur president has made available all the resources necessary to repatriate all the Nigerians here. \n\u201cWe have two planes arriving today and God willing we are hoping to evacuate anything up to 800 Nigerians today.\u201d \nNigeria had been expecting to fly back about 5,500 migrants, Onyema said, but the situation on the ground made the actual number hard to ascertain. \n\u201cSome of the difficulties with getting precise numbers is that some are within the control of the central government in camps, some are clearly outside the camps, some are also in less accessible areas where there might not be full central government control and authority,\u201d he said. \nFacilitating voluntary returns could also be complicated by lack of access, Onyema said. Criminals involved in smuggling and trafficking migrants \u201calso (have) an interest that a number of them should not be repatriated, because these represent economic assets for them\u201d. \nLibya has been in turmoil since a 2011 uprising, with rival governments and armed factions vying for power. Onyema was hosted by the internationally recognised government in Tripoli, which has struggled to assert its authority on the ground. \nSlightly fewer than half as many migrants reached Europe by sea in 2017 than 2016, the IOM said on Friday, largely due to a drop in numbers crossing from Libya.

He also called for local authorities to investigate services that help people move funds overseas. \nBloomberg reported on Monday that Chinese authorities plan to block domestic access to Chinese and offshore cryptocurrency platforms that allow centralized trading. \nChina has grown into one of the world's biggest sources of cryptocurrency mining, but Pan said authorities should work to end the practice. \nHe proposed local governments use regulations around electricity prices, land use, tax and environmental protection to guide businesses involved in such activities \"toward an orderly exit\". \n\"Pseudo-financial innovations that have no relationship with the real economy should not be supported,\" he said. \nReuters on Jan. 3 reported on China's plan to reduce the scale of bitcoin mining in the country."}

Meat is cheap (especially because producers are raising more animals), and high-protein diets remain popular. \nAlso at a new high are the number of superior butcher shops that double as restaurants. Across the country, meat-oriented chefs are fronting places that cater to the demand for aged cuts, expertly made sausages, and cured meats. These spots offer pasture-raised, humanely treated beef, pork, lamb, and chicken, as well as less common choices such as goat, venison, and game birds. \nRib roasts in Connecticut, all-natural beef on the Upper West Side, a whole-animal butchery in Austin\u2014these are among the places to go for meat in 2018. \nGrass & Bone, Mystic, Conn. \nYou\u2019d expect the coastal town of Mystic to be all about fish\u2014and perhaps pizza. Yet last summer, Daniel Meiser and James Weiner transformed a Tim Horton\u2019s doughnut outpost into a cafe with offerings such as the Grandpa Reuben (made with house-made pastrami) and bronzed rotisserie chicken with garlic mayo. The focal point of the space is a refrigerated case filled with cuts of meat dry-aged up to 90 days and sometimes more. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to do a fake butcher program,\u201d Meiser says. \u201cWe want people to come here and say, \u2018I want a 2-inch-thick aged rib-eye to make for dinner.\u2019\u201d \nWhite Gold Butchers, New York City \nOn Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side, this white-tiled space evokes an old-school butcher shop. There are dozens of all-natural, pasture-raised offerings including top sirloin, bone-in New York strip steaks, marrow bones, house-made hot dogs, and smoked kielbasa from butcher-owners Erika Nakamura, Jocelyn Guest, and April Bloomfield. Diners can add sausage, ham, bacon, pastrami, or all of them, to the breakfast egg sandwich.

She then sources them to Belcampo locations around the state, from downtown Los Angeles to Palo Alto. The hybrid butcher shop carries beef alongside free-range poultry and pork. The restaurants specialize in burgers, including 100-day dry-aged patties.

Broadcom's track record of acquiring and integrating large, complex transactions and proven ability to execute on our financial and operational targets has created tremendous value for our stockholders.

Since that time, we have spoken with many Qualcomm stockholders and customers, and we have heard their desire for Qualcomm to engage with us regarding our compelling proposal. It remains our strong preference to engage cooperatively with Qualcomm's Board and management team, and we are prepared to meet immediately to work toward a mutually acceptable definitive agreement.\nAt Qualcomm's Annual Meeting of Stockholders on March 6, 2018, you will have an important opportunity to influence the value of your investment by voting the BLUE proxy card for 11 independent and highly qualified individuals.\nBy voting for all 11 nominees on the BLUE proxy card, you can send a clear message that you want the Qualcomm Board to engage with Broadcom to maximize stockholder value.\nBROADCOM OFFERS COMPELLING VALUE FOR QUALCOMM STOCKHOLDERS\nOur $70.00 per share proposal for Qualcomm \u2013 consisting of $60.00 in cash and $10.00 in Broadcom stock \u2013 will provide you with substantial and immediate cash value upon the closing of the proposed transaction, as well as the opportunity to participate in the upside potential of the combined company.

The rules had been in force since 2016. \nThe Supreme Court, which heard petitions brought forward by tobacco-control activists, stayed the Karnataka court\u2019s order on Monday, citing the need to protect the health of citizens. \n\u201cHealth of a citizen has primacy and he or she should be aware of that which can affect or deteriorate the condition of health,\u201d the Supreme Court said in its 13-page order. \n\u201cDeterioration may be a milder word and, therefore, in all possibility the expression \u2018destruction of health\u2019 is apposite.\u201d \nThe court\u2019s decision comes as a relief for health advocates and federal health ministry who say bigger health warnings deter tobacco consumption. More than 900,000 people die each year in India due to tobacco-related illnesses, the government estimates. A man smokes a cigarette along a road in Mumbai, India, October 26, 2016. REUTERS\/Danish Siddiqui\/File Photo \nIndia\u2019s tobacco packaging rules are among the world\u2019s most stringent. A government survey last year found that 62 percent of cigarette smokers thought of quitting because of such warning labels on the packets. \nThe court's decision is a blow to cigarette makers such as India's ITC Ltd and Philip Morris International Inc's Indian partner, Godfrey Phillips India Ltd, whose representatives call the rules extreme. In protest at the health warning measures, the industry briefly shut its factories across the country in 2016 and filed dozens of legal cases.

The three judges took time to look over examples of health warning pictures used on cigarette packs. \nKapil Sibal, a lawyer who argued for the industry, urged the court to reduce the size of tobacco pack warnings. At one point, he cited the absence of health warnings on a glass of whisky to argue against such displays on tobacco products. \nThe attorney general of India, K. K. Venugopal, defended the government\u2019s stringent rules, saying they were \u201cone of the most progressive\u201d steps to protect the health of people. \nThe case will next be heard on March 12.

Instead he turned it into a s---hole.\nCarlos Barria | Reuters President Donald Trump attends a signing ceremony for the Interdict Act into law, to provide Customs and Border Protection agents with the latest screening technology on the fight against the opioid crisis, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington D.C. In an alternate reality, Trump would have luxuriated with fellow Republicans in a warm bath of positive news. Walmart just announced a higher minimum wage and bonuses, joining a parade of other companies doling out cash to workers and crediting the GOP tax plan. A new poll showed rising faith in the U.S. economy. Blackrock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC the new lower tax rate would boost the U.S. over Mexico.\nAll this should be have been music to Trumpian ears and an opportunity to do what senior West Wing staff are regularly begging the president to do: Stay on a positive message about bigger paychecks and faster economic growth.\nAdministration officials privately say the key to reversing Trump's dismal approval rating and the GOP's awful generic ballot numbers against Democrats is to get people to credit them for improving economic conditions.\nThe Quinnipiac poll showed a plurality of Americans still credit the Obama administration for the state of the economy. But with a signature piece of legislation now enacted and companies beginning to respond, Republicans have a decent case to make that they should start to get the credit.\nEven a marginally functional chief executive could execute on this strategy. Trump can't. The president started his day on Thursday live tweeting \"Fox & Friends\" and in the span of a few minutes rebuked his own administration's policy on domestic surveillance and then had to reverse himself.\nBut things really blew up later in the day when at a private meeting with lawmakers, Trump reportedly asked why the U.S. has to accept immigrants from \"s---hole\" countries, an apparent reference to Haiti and some African nations. He also reportedly said: \"Why do we want people from Haiti here?\"\nThe comments blew up on social media and cable television, completely wiping out news about Walmart and the economy. It did not end there.\nTrump also gave a lengthy and bizarre interview to The Wall Street Journal in which he suggested the market might go up if he pulled out of NAFTA, rambled about a Mexican wall with windows, suggested he might have secretly met Kim Jong Un and boasted about how he is the smartest and best at pretty much everything.\nPerhaps sensing the interview was going off the rails, a White House staffer present for the discussion kept trying to get Trump out of the room.\nThe president could have steered back on message on Friday, hoping the \"s---hole\" controversy would die out. But of course he didn't. He kept it going at least another day by tweeting a denial.\n\"The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!\"\nHe added: \"Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said \"take them out.\" Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trust!\"\nHe did this despite the White House not denying any of the comments on Thursday and multiple news organizations confirming them. Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Ill., who was present for the remarks, rebuked Trump's denial on Friday: \"It's not true. He said those hateful things, and he said them repeatedly.\"\nAll this guarantees that news and social media feeds over the weekend will obsess and argue over whether Trump really said racist and disgusting things. And a bunch of news on the economy that might actually help the president and the GOP will get dumped down the s---hole."}

Hogan vowed to oppose the plan \"to the fullest extent that is legally possible.\"\nAdditionally, more than 60 environmental groups have denounced the plan. Many industry groups, meanwhile, are praising the decision.\nshow chapters Trump's offshore drilling plan just juices up the Democratic base: Expert 13 Hours Ago | 00:29 With both parties gearing up for what are set to be fiercely competitive midterm elections in November 2018, this will likely give further motivation to Democrats to mobilize votes across states where competition will be tight, and particularly in coastal states like Florida.\nAccording to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, the draft proposal offers about 90 percent of the U.S. outer continental shelf for leasing, representing the largest lease sale in history . This sharply reverses an Obama administration ban on drilling in much of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, which was meant to be indefinite.\nZinke added that while the proposal has been put forth, \"nothing is final yet.\"\nThe move is the latest by Trump to continue delivering on his campaign promise to roll back Obama-era policies and dismantle government regulation through executive orders. \"That doesn't require congressional support,\" Trubowitz said. \"He could move unilaterally, that seems from day one to have been the strategy.\""}

Sluggish inflation has been a persistent concern for the Fed, and Yellen and incoming chair Jerome Powell have described the lack of pricing power as a mystery. Besides the economic data, the next real clarity on the Fed's view of inflation will be when the Fed issues new forecasts after its March meeting and incoming chair Jerome Powell holds his first post-meeting briefing. Getty Images Janet Yellen \nFed Chair Janet Yellen ends her tenure with the Fed seemingly less worried about the lack of inflation and ready to raise interest rates three or more times this year. \nThe Fed's statement, released after Yellen's final meeting Wednesday, removed some of its prior pessimism about inflation. It dropped language about inflation having declined, and noted that inflation expectations have been rising. The Fed also included that it expects to see inflation move up this year and stabilize around its 2 percent target. \nSluggish inflation has been a persistent concern for the Fed, and both Yellen and incoming chair Jerome Powell have described the lack of pricing power as inexplicable, or a mystery. \n\"There are modest tweaks in the statement, They are all leaning slightly hawkish,\" said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Cabana said the expectations in the fed funds futures market remain for just under three rate hikes this year, with the first one in March. \nThe Fed also upgraded its view on the economy, dropping references to the impact of hurricanes and noting strength in household spending. \nJ.P. Morgan economists, who are forecasting four rate hikes this year, saw another hawkish change in the statement. \n\"The final, and most curious, change to the statement was in the forward guidance, where the prior references to the expectation for 'gradual adjustments' in monetary policy and 'gradual increases' in the funds rate were changed to 'further gradual adjustments' in monetary policy and 'further gradual increases' in the funds rate,\" wrote J.P. Morgan chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli. \"Perhaps we're a bit biased, given our hawkish expectations for this year, but we tend to see the addition of 'further' as underscoring the Committee's sense that they're not yet close to being finished.\" \nFeroli also noted that the phrase could be seen as intentional, given the more hawkish makeup of the Fed members who are on the Federal Open Market Committee and wrote the statement. \nThe Fed may have given a nod to the potential for more inflation, but strategists say the only clarity will be when it shows up in the data, and that's when the market could shift to expect more Fed rate hikes. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core PCE deflator, showed just an annual 1.5 percent increase in December, about the same as when Yellen took over as chair. But Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a hedge against inflation, are at their highest since 2014. \nThe next place markets are watching for signs of inflation is in the wages data released with Friday's January employment report. But the Fed's next major pronouncement on inflation may not come until after its March meeting, when it issues its latest forecasts and Powell holds his first briefing with the press. Powell is expected to testify before Congress on the economy in February, but strategists don't expect a real change in tone until the Fed forecasts are updated. \n\"We think they upgraded their view slightly on inflation, but the last time they voted there were two dissenters, and it will be interesting to see when we come around to March, when the Fed is expected to raise rates, if there are dissenters on inflation,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management. \"It will be interesting to see if, as the new chairman takes the helm, the inflation story changes.

Treasury yields were higher on the day, and the 2-year, which most reflects Fed policy moves, was at 2.16 percent, its highest level since 2008. \nRipley said the move higher in Treasury yields Wednesday was partly the result of an announcement from the Treasury on the expected increase in the size of its auctions. \"They're adding supply on the long end, another $1 billion in [10-years] and another billion in 30s. This is all coming in an environment where the Fed, as the biggest buyer is paring back its purchases in the Treasury market,\" said Ripley. \nThe Fed has proceeded on a course to reduce its balance sheet by no longer replacing all of the securities maturing on its balance sheet. \"The challenge for Chair Powell will be to wade further into the uncharted waters of unwinding the crisis-era measures of near-zero interest rates and large asset purchases without creating waves in the financial markets,\" wrote Diane Swonk, the chief economist at Grant Thornton.

Approximately 80 percent of homeowners now have tappable equity, cash which could fuel the economy. Under the new Republican tax law, the interest paid on home equity lines of credit is no longer deductible. 1 Hour Ago | 01:32 \nA growing number of homeowners are in the money \u2014 big money. \nThe amount of home equity borrowers now have at their disposal reached an all-time high in the third quarter of last year. The 42 million homeowners with mortgages have a collective $5.5 trillion in \"tappable\" equity, according to Black Knight Data & Analytics, which studies the mortgage industry. \nThis is $3 trillion more than they had when the housing market last bottomed in 2012, after the financial crisis. Black Knight defines tappable equity as the amount available for homeowners to borrow before reaching 80 percent of debt to value against their home. \nFollowing the housing crash, millions of borrowers fell underwater on their mortgages, owing more than their homes were worth. Fast-rising home prices over the last two years have brought borrowers above water and beyond. Approximately 80 percent of homeowners now have equity they can use, cash which could fuel the economy. Just 2.7 percent of borrowers, or about 1.36 million, still owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. \"HELOC's are very popular, but they recently lost a major benefit.\" \nGenerally, there are two ways to take cash out of an equity-rich home. \nOne is to refinance the original mortgage to a larger loan. This could possibly change the interest rate on the loan. The other way is to take out a second loan, either a home equity mortgage, which is a lump sum, or a home equity line of credit (HELOC), which is essentially like a checking account on your home. \nHELOCs are very popular, but they recently lost a major benefit. Under the new Republican tax law, the interest paid on these loans is no longer deductible . Borrowers used to be able to deduct interest paid on up to $100,000 in home equity loan debt. \nFor primary loans, mortgage borrowers can still deduct the interest paid on up to $750,000 worth of mortgage debt, down from $1 million under the previous tax code. That raises the question of whether it is better just to do a cash-out refinance instead. \n\"Homeowners who will still itemize under the new tax plan will likely find the lack of deductibility of HELOC interest swings the value pendulum towards cash-out refinances as a way to tap their equity,\" said Ben Graboske, executive vice president of Black Knight. \n\"This is particularly true for those with low first-lien balances drawing greater amounts of equity. On the other hand, for those with high first-lien balances drawing low volumes of equity, the math still tends to favor HELOCs.\" show chapters 2:18 PM ET Wed, 20 Dec 2017 | 02:43 \nWith mortgage rates currently lower than they were a year ago, cash-out refinances have been growing in popularity. \nBorrowers doing cash-out refinances withdrew $68,000 in equity on average for a total of $26 billion in the third quarter of last year. Cash-outs now account for 62 percent of all refinances, but it is still far far less than during the housing boom in 2005, when borrowers were essentially using their homes as cash machines. \n\"The Great Recession wasn't all that long ago, and the memory is likely still in the backs of minds of both lenders and borrowers alike,\" Graboske said. \nLenders are considerably more risk averse today, so mortgage underwriting is much more strict. Borrowers are exhibiting more restraint as well, in terms of both deciding whether or not to tap into that available equity, and if so, how much, according to Graboske. \nThere is also the possibility that home values in some regions most affected by the new tax law could fall, causing homeowners to lose some of this new-found equity. \nHomeowners can now only deduct $10,000 in property taxes. In high tax states, that could put downward pressure on home values. Homeowners with loans of more than $750,000, who are currently grandfathered into the $1 million mortgage deduction cap, should consult their tax advisors as to whether a cash-out refinance would change their status.The law is currently unclear on that point.

FILE PHOTO - The Intel logo is shown at the E3 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2017. REUTERS\/ Mike Blake \nOne of the bugs is specific to Intel but the other affects laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, tablets and internet servers alike. Intel and ARM insisted that the issue was not a design flaw, but it will require users to download a patch and update their operating system to fix. \nResearchers with Alphabet Inc\u2019s ( GOOGL.O ) Google Project Zero, in conjunction with academic and industry researchers from several countries, discovered two flaws. \nThe first, called Meltdown, affects Intel chips and lets hackers bypass the hardware barrier between applications run by users and the computer\u2019s memory, potentially letting hackers read a computer\u2019s memory and steal passwords. The second, called Spectre, affects chips from Intel, AMD and ARM and lets hackers potentially trick otherwise error-free applications into giving up secret information. \nThe researchers said Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) and Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) had patches ready for users for desktop computers affected by Meltdown. Microsoft and Apple did not immediately return requests for comment. \nDaniel Gruss, one of the researchers at Graz University of Technology who discovered Meltdown, called it \u201cprobably one of the worst CPU bugs ever found\u201d in an interview with Reuters. \nGruss said Meltdown was the more serious problem in the short term but could be decisively stopped with software patches. Spectre, the broader bug that applies to nearly all computing devices, is harder for hackers to take advantage of but less easily patched and will be a bigger problem in the long term, he said. \nEarlier in the day, Intel had acknowledged a report that a design flaw in its chips could let hackers steal data from computing devices but said that it was working on a solution that would not significantly slow computers. \nOn Tuesday, tech publication The Register reported the flaw in Intel microprocessors required updates to computer operating systems, adding that the fix causes the chips to operate more slowly. \nIntel said the problem was broader than its chips alone and that it was working with Advanced Micro Devices Inc ( AMD.O ), ARM Holdings and others to fix the problem. Intel also denied that the patches would bog down computers based on Intel chips. \n\u201cIntel has begun providing software and firmware updates to mitigate these exploits,\u201d Intel said in a statement. \u201cContrary to some reports, any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time.\u201d \nARM spokesman Phil Hughes confirmed that ARM was working with AMD and Intel to fix a security hole found by researchers but said it was \u201cnot an architectural flaw\u201d and that patches had already been shared with the companies\u2019 partners, which include most smartphone manufacturers. \n\u201cThis method only works if a certain type of malicious code is already running on a device and could at worst result in small pieces of data being accessed from privileged memory,\u201d Hughes said in an email. \nAMD chips are also affected by variants of a security flaw also discovered in Intel chips, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. The earlier report in The Register suggested that AMD chips were not affected, which appeared to boost shares. \nThe defect affects the so-called kernel memory on Intel x86 processor chips manufactured over the past decade, The Register reported citing unnamed programmers, allowing users of normal applications to discern the layout or content of protected areas on the chips. \nThat could make it possible for hackers to exploit other security bugs or, worse, expose secure information such as passwords, thus compromising individual computers or even entire server networks. \nShares in Intel were down by 3.4 percent following the report while shares in AMD rose 1 percent. \nThe Register said programmers working on the Linux open-source operating system were overhauling the affected memory areas, while Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) was expected to issue a Windows patch next Tuesday. \n\"Crucially, these updates to both Linux and Windows will incur a performance hit on Intel products,\" The Register wrote ( bit.ly\/2CsRxkj ). \n\u201cThe effects are being benchmarked, however we are looking at a ballpark figure of a five to 30 percent slowdown, depending on the task and the processor model.\u201d \nMicrosoft declined to comment. \nIt was not immediately clear whether Intel would face any significant financial liability arising from the reported flaw. \n\u201cThe current Intel problem, if true, would likely not require CPU replacement in our opinion. However the situation is fluid,\u201d Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities in New York said in a note, adding it could hurt the company\u2019s reputation. \nThe bug is likely to affect major cloud computing platforms such as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s ( AMZN.O ) EC2, Microsoft Azure and Alphabet Inc\u2019s ( GOOGL.O ) Compute Engine, according to one software blogger cited by The Register. \nMicrosoft Azure is due to undergo a maintenance reboot on Jan. 10 while Amazon Web Services has also advised customers via email to expect a major security update Friday. \nThe Register also said that similar operating systems, such as Apple Inc\u2019s ( AAPL.O ) 64-bit macOS operating system, would need to be updated. \nThe Linux patches are based on work by researchers from the Graz University of Technology in Austria who came up with a way to split kernel and user memory spaces to eliminate the security vulnerability.

State law gives insurers more leeway to drop coverage than to raise rates, and some have been taking the opportunity to not renew policies, a trend concerning Jones.\nThe California Department of Insurance lacks authority to regulate how insurers underwrite property insurance, a problem the state's legislature must fix, Jones said.\nHe unveiled legislative proposals to change computer models that homeowner insurers rely on for house-by-house predictions of risk, now using factors such as local topography and brush cover. Jones wants to require the models to include wildfire mitigation efforts, such as homeowner or community efforts to clear brush, according to the report.\n\"There are no specific statutory standards in place to ensure the models accuracy or reliability in rating and underwriting of homeowners insurance,\" Jones said in the report.\nJones also wants homeowners to be able to appeal the risk scores that models generate which insurers use to make coverage decisions.\nIt was unclear whether legislators would take up Jones' proposals, but at least one California lawmaker has suggested that insurers give discounts when homeowners reduce their wildfire risks.\nWe look forward to reviewing Commissioner Jones recommendations and working with him and other policymakers to address wildfire safety and recovery efforts, while balancing the need to remain solvent and pay future claims,\" said Mark Sektnan, vice president of state government relations for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.\nHomeowners can already appeal risk scores by talking to insurers who, in turn, can ask risk modeling companies to review the property again, said Janet Ruiz, a spokeswoman for the industrys Insurance Information Institute.\nThe 2017 wildfires will not change Allstate Corp's underwriting in the state, said the insurer's chief executive officer, Tom Wilson, in an unrelated interview on Thursday. Allstate already scaled back its wildfire exposure four to five years ago, said Wilson.\n\"But you do have to make sure over time that youre collecting the proper amount of money for that,\" Wilson said.

Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) speaks during a news conference in Warsaw, Poland March 13, 2017. REUTERS\/Kacper Pempel \/Files \nThe march caught the attention of the world\u2019s media because some of the 60,000 participants carried banners bearing racist and xenophobic slogans such as \u201cpure blood, clear mind\u201d and \u201cEurope will be white or uninhabited\u201d. \nStalowa Wola\u2019s PiS mayor, Lucjusz Nadberezny, does \u201cnot regret the decision to support the trip\u201d. His office said in a statement the November Independence Day march was a \u201csafe and joyous manifestation of patriotism\u201d and that people from his town did not participate in any \u201cprovocations\u201d. \nA resurgence of far-right sentiment poses a dilemma for the PiS - a socially conservative group with a nationalist agenda. \nFar-right voters are a threat and an opportunity. The party tapped into frustration with western liberal values, when it won the 2015 election with the biggest majority by any party since the end of communism. \nIn other European states where anti-establishment right-wing slogans are also increasingly resonant, several far-right groups have got a foothold in power. \nBut in Poland they have had little success, or desire, to compete for office. This is in large part because the PiS has tailored its message across the spectrum of right-wing voters. \nThe activists from Stalowa Wola said they were going to Warsaw to express their opposition to \u201can invasion of immigrants and atheism in Europe\u201d. \nWhile several PiS officials said any racist slogans were few and unrepresentative, they also praised the march. \nForeign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said afterwards it fuelled \u201cpatriotic behaviour of Poles\u201d and any displays of xenophobia were \u201cincidents\u201d that were \u201cof course, reprehensible.\u201d \nHis comments were a typical PiS mix of patriotism with a general condemnation of racism and anti-Semitism. \nJaroslaw Kaczynski, the powerful leader of the PiS who has no formal position in government, said in 2015 that Middle East migrants could bring parasites and diseases to Poland. \nBut he also said that the racist banners at the march were \u201cdisgraceful rubbish\u201d and that the \u201cPolish tradition\u201d has nothing to do with racism or anti-Semitism. RISK OF BREAKAWAY GROUP \nThe PiS is mindful of the need to retain the support of all right-wing voters, including far-right, for elections in each of the next three years. \nIt is also wary of the risk of a breakaway, ultraconservative group emerging to challenge its majority in parliament. \nTadeusz Cymanski, deputy head of the PiS parliamentary caucus said it is better if far-right organisations such as ONR, which helped organise the Warsaw march, do not feel threatened by the PiS. \n\u201cIt is in the interest of democracy, in the interest of our state that extreme groups, either left or right-wing, have no representation in parliament,\u201d he told Reuters. \n\u201cAny association (of ONR with PiS) is painful and unpleasant, I reject it with shame, but I think it would be better even if I, or my faction, were associated with them rather than these forces were to gain in force.\u201d People hold a Polish national flag during a demonstration in Warsaw, Poland February 27, 2016. REUTERS\/Krzysztof Miller\/Agencja Gazeta\/Files \nHe said the PiS is mindful that its 2015 election victory was fuelled in part by the fact that several smaller groups did not cross the election threshold, earning PiS extra seats in parliament. \nAnother outspoken PiS member, Ryszard Czarnecki, said the party gave all right-leaning voters a sense of belonging, in contrast to the previous centrist government which was seen as \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d. \n\u201cRight-wing voters have the feeling ... that we are a serious group, which has power, fulfils the right-wing agenda, so there is no need to escape towards the far right,\u201d he said. \n\u201cA number of young people now prefer to vote for PiS. If (centrist) rule continued, then I think radical movements would have been stronger in Poland.\u201d \nThe party\u2019s more centrist electorate has stuck with it despite the move to embrace the right, partly because of generous social policies. But any stronger association with the far-right could turn those voters away, analysts say. XENOPHOBIA RISING \nONR and other far-right Polish groups such as Mlodziez Wszechpolska refuse to release membership figures but analysts say acceptance of xenophobic slogans as well as violence against Muslims is on the rise. \nIn a November 2016 survey by CBOS, a pollster overseen by the government, 95 percent of Poles said they did not know anyone from a far-right group. However, more than one in three said they supported far-right activities. \nHate crimes committed against Muslims have grown by more than 300 percent between 2013 and 2016, according to data from the Warsaw University\u2019s Center for Research on Prejudice. \nONR, which calls for \u201cethnic homogeneity\u201d in Poland in its official literature, says it has helped the PiS. \n\u201cPiS has copied some of our rhetoric, for example referring to migrants from Muslim states,\u201d said ONR deputy chief Tomasz Dorosz. \u201cThis has assured their victory in the last election.\u201d \nPoland, like Hungary, has refused to take in any of its European Union quota of refugees from Syria and elsewhere on the grounds that Muslim immigrants are a threat to national security and stability. \nNew PiS Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told the state-run television TVP on Monday that the government\u2019s stance on migrants is not going to change \u201cin years to come\u201d. \n\u201cWe will not accept refugees, migrants from the Middle East and Africa. This is our sovereign decision,\u201d Morawiecki said. \nIn 2016 the PiS government disbanded the Council for the Prevention of Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Intolerancee, an advisory body to the government, and a unit at the interior ministry responsible, among others, for monitoring hate crimes. \n\u201cWhile the PiS governs increasingly as a far-right party, it didn\u2019t campaign as such and it wasn\u2019t elected as such,\u201d said Cas Mudde, an expert on the far-right at the University of Georgia. \nBut with local elections expected in late 2018, a parliamentary vote in 2019 and presidential elections in 2020, this tactic is expected to continue.

We also have to ensure the Chinese don\u2019t take over the market and put every non-5G network out of business.\u201d \nIn Beijing on Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China prohibited all forms of hacking, but did not specifically address the 5G network security issue. \n\u201cWe believe that the international community should, on the basis of mutual respect and trust, strengthen dialogue and cooperation and join hands in addressing the threat of cyber attacks,\u201d Hua told a regular news briefing. \nMajor wireless carriers have spent billions of dollars buying spectrum to launch 5G networks, and it is unclear if the U.S. government would have enough spectrum to build its own 5G network. \nFurthermore, Accenture has estimated that wireless operators will invest as much as $275 billion in the United States over seven years as they build out 5G. \nLast year, T-Mobile US Inc spent $8 billion and Dish Network Corp $6.2 billion to win the bulk of broadcast airwaves spectrum for sale in a government auction. \nAn AT&T spokesman said they could not comment on something they have not seen, and added, \u201cThanks to multi-billion dollar investments made by American companies, the work to launch 5G service in the United States is already well down the road.\u201d \nLater this year, AT&T is set to be the first to launch mobile 5G service in 12 U.S. locations, the spokesman said. \nA Verizon spokesman declined to comment. Representatives for Sprint and T-Mobile did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nAnother option includes having a 5G network built by a consortium of wireless carriers, the U.S. official said. Related Coverage U.S. telco shares fall on 5G network reports despite skepticism \n\u201cWe want to build a secure 5G network and we have to work with industry to figure out the best way to do it,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \nAxios published documents it said were from a presentation from a National Security Council official. If the government built the network, it would rent access to carriers, Axios said. \nA looming concern laid out in the presentation was China\u2019s growing presence in the manufacture and operation of wireless networks. A concerted government push could help the U.S. compete on that front, according to the presentation. \nA 5G network is expected to offer significantly faster speeds, more capacity and shorter response times, which could be utilized for new technologies ranging from self-driving cars to remote surgeries. Telecom companies and their suppliers consider it to be a multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity.

Iraq until recently had refused to take them back, but struck a deal with the United States in March to repatriate its citizens, sparking the immigration sweeps. \nThe Iraqis and civil rights groups representing them sued the federal government. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith, in Detroit, had previously halted the deportation of the Iraqis, many of whom are Christian, who argued they would face persecution if they were sent back to Iraq. \nIn his ruling on Tuesday, Goldsmith said that any of the Iraqis held for six months or longer must either be released or granted a bond hearing before an immigration judge within 30 days. \n\u201cOur legal tradition rejects warehousing human beings while their legal rights are being determined,\u201d wrote Goldsmith. \nThe Trump administration has tried to deport the Iraqis as part of its push to increase immigration enforcement and make countries, which have resisted in the past, take back nationals ordered deported from the United States.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo \nSince June, immigration enforcement officers have detained approximately 300 Iraqi nationals with final deportation orders, according to information provided to the court by the Iraqis\u2019 lawyers. There are approximately 1,400 Iraqis in the United States with final deportation orders. \nThe U.S. government said in March that Iraq had agreed to repatriate Iraqi nationals ordered deported from the United States. \nBut Goldsmith noted in his order that the United States has \u201cno written agreement\u201d with Iraq regarding its cooperation, and that it is therefore unclear whether Iraq had agreed to take back all its nationals, and if so, under what conditions. \nGoldsmith said his ruling would apply to Iraqi detainees in similar circumstances nationwide, even if they are not involved in the litigation. \n\u201c(Goldsmith) just really reaffirmed the principle that indefinite detention in this country is not acceptable,\u201d said Kary Moss, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, which is representing the Iraqis. \nThe Department of Justice, which is arguing on behalf of the government, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

There were also signs that the replicating virus had stimulated the immune system, with white blood cells or so-called \u201ckiller\u201d T-cells being drawn to the tumour to attack it. \nBecause the virus only infects cancer cells and leaves healthy cells alone, patients who received the experimental treatment reported only mild side-effects such as slight flu-like symptoms. \nUntil these positive results, scientists had been doubtful about whether the virus would be able to pass into the brain because of the protective blood-brain barrier membrane. \nHowever, injecting the virus directly into the brain would be difficult and potentially dangerous. \nAlan Melcher of Britain\u2019s Institute of Cancer Research, who also co-led the study, said the results pointed a way forward for more trials using this virus, including testing whether it can harness the immune system to super-charge the effect of existing chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments. \n\u201cNow we know we can get reovirus across the blood-brain barrier, we have begun clinical studies to see just how effective this viral immunotherapy can be,\u201d he said.

{"published":"2018-01-06T00:43:00.000+02:00","title":"CES kicks off with no lead women speakers or code of conduct","text":"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - The technology industry's premier annual gathering kicks off next week with no women leading the keynote sessions and no code of conduct that might prevent incidents of sexual harassment, despite efforts by organizers to cast the show as a more inclusive event.\nCES, the showcase for the latest consumer electronics from televisions to self-driving cars, is known for mostly male attendees and female models known as 'booth babes' showing off the new technology.\nIt has attracted criticism for not making itself more welcoming for women or toning down its sexualized atmosphere even as the issue of harassment and assault has grabbed headlines in the last six months and propelled the #MeToo movement into life.\n\"The fact that this large global gathering of tech leaders is totally ignoring this issue makes them completely tone deaf and irresponsible,\" said Liliana Aide Monge, chief executive of California coding school Sabio, who is skipping CES for the second year in a row because of the lack of women and minority speakers.\nThe organizers of CES, which opens its doors to nearly 200,000 attendees in Las Vegas on Tuesday, drew criticism last month from executives at Twitter Inc and other tech companies for a keynote list dominated by white men. CES made a concerted push to diversify its entire speaker lineup, but ultimately failed to find a high-ranking female executive for an individual keynote address.\n\"To keynote at CES, the speaker must head (president\/CEO level) a large entity who has name recognition in the industry,\" said Karen Chupka, who oversees the event as senior vice president at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), in a blog post a month ago. \"As upsetting as it is, there is a limited pool when it comes to women in these positions. We feel your pain. It bothers us, too. The tech industry and every industry must do better.\"\nOn top of that, CES also will go forward without creating a code of conduct, a mechanism several conferences in technology and other industries have adopted in recent years to set rules for behavior for attendees, from guidelines on using inclusive language in presentations to requirements that attendees wear name tags at all events, even after hours, to deter misconduct.\n\"Its sad that CES doesnt have a code of conduct, said Y-Vonne Hutchinson, founder of ReadySet, a diversity-focused consulting firm. \"They have a lot of influence. If theyre choosing not to leverage that to promote diversity and inclusion at large, that communicates to the rest of the industry that maybe it isnt as necessary as we keep saying that it is.\"\nHIGH STAKES\nEvidence of the effect on shows safety and tone is mostly anecdotal, but several conferences with these codes, including hacker convention DEF CON, CoreOS Fest and Cloud Foundry Summit, say they have removed attendees after reports of harassment.\nThe stakes are high for the technology industry, rocked in the past year by a sexual harassment scandal at Uber Technologies Inc and misconduct by some prominent Silicon Valley investors.\nThe organizers of CES say they expect attendees to heed their own companies standards of business conduct and will kick out anyone who behaves poorly, but will not introduce a set of guidelines.\n\"We dont necessarily have specific rules because we assume everyone will be held accountable to the standards of being in an office, said Chupka.\nUnacceptable behavior would be addressed by the executive team and legal counsel as necessary, the CTA said. We have the right at any time to revoke a show badge and\/or trespass an individual. CES notes that it has received no reports of sexual harassment at the event in recent years.\nWomen subjected to uncomfortable situations at or near past CES gatherings told Reuters that they did not report incidents because they were too used to it or did not recognize there was a way to do so.\nTo change that thinking, the show is debuting a security app that lets attendees report issues from crimes to broken elevators. While there will be no effort to promote the app specifically as a way to report sexual harassment, attendees may do so, and CES said its lawyers will be ready to act.\nSLUSH CODE\nThe need for a code of conduct became apparent at Finland's Slush tech startup event in 2016 when multiple women spoke up about being inappropriately touched and receiving unwanted propositions for sex by male attendees as well as being ignored by investors who were only interested in working with male entrepreneurs.\nThe following year, it doubled security, trained staff on how to handle reports of harassment and instituted a code of conduct, including a requirement to wear name badges at all times as a way to make it easier for attendees to identify a harasser.\nA similar approach has been adopted by some in the U.S. tech industry. Salesforce.com Inc's Dreamforce event, second only to CES in attendee numbers, added a code of conduct in 2014, while film, tech and music conference South by Southwest added one in 2016. Meanwhile, large conferences run by Oracle Corp and RSA Security have not adopted such a code.\nIt remains to be seen if CES's lack of a code of conduct will prove costly.\nLas Vegas' reputation for excess is part of the problem, said Liz Lopez, a tech marketing professional who has attended several industry conferences in the city.\nPeople are over the edge in their behavior when theyre in Vegas, she said.

In 2017, American said it took in $4.88 in adjusted per-share earnings.\nNet income fell nearly 11 percent to $258 million, or 54 cents per share, on the year. Excluding nonrecurring costs, the airline earned 95 cents per share, topping estimates of 92 cents per share from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.\nLike its competitors, American is grappling with higher fuel costs. The airline said its fuel bill rose some 20 percent in the last quarter from 2016.\nIn an effort to grow revenue and profits amid margin-crimping cost increases, American and its rivals are segmenting their cabins into smaller classes of service, including no-frills basic economy and premium economy, which offers a larger seat, more leg room and an amenities kit for a higher fare. The airline said it expects the latter to be installed on most of its widebody fleet by the spring of 2019.\nAmerican's shares were down more than 3 percent in early trading Thursday. Airline shares fell sharply on Tuesday after United Airlines announced it would aggressively add seats to the market over the next three years, sparking worries of higher costs and a possible fare war .\n\"Management will likely need to calm some fears about domestic competition, but it's not like they are a stranger to competition,\" Cowen & Co. said in a note. \"American competes with Southwest Airlines in Dallas and Spirit Airlines in Chicago, and has more than held its own.

Buzz60 Greene's timeline is similar to the one recommended by retirement-plan provider Fidelity Investments , which says a good rule of thumb is to have the equivalent of your salary saved by age 30 and to have 10 times your final salary in savings if you want to retire by age 67. \"While this can sound super daunting today, if you're putting that money to work starting in your 20s, it's not as difficult as it sounds,\" says Greene. She also notes that \"life is anything but linear,\" and it's impossible to follow this formula to a tee. You may have to adjust accordingly and save more or less in any given year, depending on major life events, such as having a kid or buying a home. Need help spending less and saving more?

Apple began replacing the batteries after backlash from customers who noticed that Apple had started to throttle the speeds of the phones, making them feel slower. \nThere are rumors that it's taking up to months to get a replacement, however, so we decided to find out just how bad the situation is firsthand using both an iPhone 6 and 6s. \nHere's what went down. The process Locations with appointments to swap a battery. \nFirst, we visited Apple's support website and selected assistance for the iPhone, chose the battery option and then selected \"battery replacement.\" We decided it would be best to try to get the battery swapped in an Apple Store, and selected the \"bring in for repair\" option. \nApple showed a list of locations where we could get the battery swapped as soon as the next day \u2014 including places such as Best Buy and mom and pop shops. The majority of locations didn't have appointments for a few days. \nWe decided to try the 14th Street Apple Store in New York and made an appointment for the next day. The experience Walking into the 14th Street Apple Store \nThere's good news and bad news. \nApple said it couldn't replace the battery in our iPhone 6 for about two weeks. An employee said that about 90 percent of his appointments are for battery replacements, which suggests Apple can't keep up with the demand right now. \nOn the other hand, Apple said it could replace the battery in our iPhone 6s in just two hours. It was also eligible for a free battery replacement since it was purchased between October and November 2015. Phones sold at that time were more sensitive to temperature changes, causing them to turn off. \nAs with most Apple repairs, your phone can't have excessive damage. The iPhone 6s we brought in had seen better days \u2014 and had a third-party screen replacement. It was also missing the screws near the charging port. \nThe Apple Genius Bar employee was skeptical about the phone's third-party screen, and said there was a 50 percent chance that if they took the phone apart it wouldn't work again. If so, it would require a $129 screen repair, or we would have to replace the entire device for $299. \nWe decided to take the risk \u2014 and it paid off. We picked it up later in the evening with a new battery. Your mileage may vary Todd Haselton | CNBC Waiting for our replacement. \nAnother colleague at CNBC said she took two iPhone 6 units to a Best Buy, also with an appointment made through Apple's website, and was told that there wasn't stock available to replace her battery. A call to Best Buy a week later confirmed there still weren't any batteries available. \nYour luck may vary depending on where you live and whether or not your nearby Apple Store has batteries in stock or not. If you live far away, consider calling ahead of time. Our advice CNBC\/Michelle Castillo This iPhone 6S went from 100 percent battery to 14 percent in four hours. \nWhile Apple has said it will soon release an update that will let users see their battery health and even deactivate Apple's automatic slowdowns on the processor, we still recommend getting your battery replaced . \nIt'll cost $29 and you'll have a fresh battery pack and a phone running at full speed again. Just know that you might need to wait a bit before they're in stock."}

As the group\u2019s presence in the Middle East crumbles, some are returning with family members, while German authorities are trying to secure the release of children whose parents have been detained.\nIn a document addressed to a lawmaker and seen by Reuters on Monday, Interior Ministry State Secretary Emily Haber said it was difficult to estimate the exact number of children set to arrive since it was unclear how many babies were born while their parents were in Iraq or Syria.\nBut security officials had information indicating that \u201ca low three-digit number of minors is expected,\u201d with the majority believed to be babies or toddlers, Haber said in a reply to a formal parliamentary query by Greens lawmaker Irene Mihalic.\nHans-Georg Maassen, head of the BfV domestic intelligence agency, had warned in October that children of returning Islamists could pose a threat after being \u201csocialised and indoctrinated in the battlefield areas.\u201d\nThe radicalisation of children has been in the spotlight given that three of five Islamist attacks in Germany in 2016 were carried out by minors, and a 12-year-old boy was also detained after trying to bomb a Christmas market in Ludwigshafen.\nThe German government says it has evidence that more than 960 people left Germany for Iraq and Syria through November 2017 to fight for the Islamic State jihadist group, of which about a third are believed to have returned to Germany. Another 150 likely died in combat, according to government data.\nState Secretary Haber said there was no evidence of a big increase in the return of people from Iraq and Syria in recent months despite military setbacks for Islamic State.\nThe German foreign ministry was providing consular services to German citizens and their children who had been detained or imprisoned in Iraq, and was seeking the return of children that were now imprisoned with their parents in Iraq, Haber said.\n\u201cNo timeline can be given for the return of these children since this is largely dependent on the cooperation of the Iraqi authorities,\u201d she wrote.\nGiven Germany\u2019s decentralised federal structure, state officials had the main responsibility for deradicalisation of those who returned from Iraq and Syria, including those were convicted and incarcerated, Haber said.\nBut she said the federal government was supporting those efforts through a number of initiatives, including support for families of those who left Germany to fight for Islamic State.\nNew federally-funded programmes were planned in 2018 to educate and deradicalise returning foreign fighters, and the federal government was also funding programmes in each of the 16 states to prevent further radicalisation in prison, Haber said.\nReporting by Sabine Siebold and Andrea Shalal; Editing by Toby Chopra\n "}

Cramer also sat down with the CEO of Mindbody, a cloud-based software company that helps health and wellness businesses run their operations and find customers. In the lightning round, Cramer brushed off the negative commentary about one semiconductor stock. Published 21 Hours Ago SHARES show chapters 20 Hours Ago | 01:08 \nAs much as some market-watchers may discredit the Dow Jones industrial average , the index has always been a trustworthy proxy for stock performance for CNBC's Jim Cramer. \n\"In fact, right now it's more important than it's been in a long time because its snapshot of 2017 gives you a terrific view of the winners and losers in classic big-cap names, with the overall score a very representative plus-25 percent,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \nTo get a better snapshot of what worked and what didn't in 2017, Cramer ran through the Dow's best and worst performers . \nFirst and worst of all the Dow components was General Electric , down a staggering 45 percent after a rough 2017. \n\"It takes a special kind of industrial to lose that much value during the best economy in ages,\" Cramer said. \"GE refuses to be introspective about what went wrong. That's a bummer. I certainly hope that new CEO John Flannery explains why the company couldn't earn the $2 this year that it forecast at the end of 2016. If he walks us through it and takes the big write-down we've all been expecting, I think it'll be greeted positively.\" \nFlannery's laundry list of turnaround tasks includes stemming the losses from GE's many struggling divisions and selling assets to pay for the company's dividend. \n\"I can't believe that GE's truly as horrendous as the stock suggests, but I've been wrong all the way down,\" Cramer admitted. \"I'm keeping it on a tight leash for my charitable trust, and I've issued more mea culpas for owning this one for my trust than any other stock the trust has owned in 15 years, but I want to see what Flannery lays out before I decide whether to bail into the newfound buying we've seen over the last couple days.\" \"Baked in?\" Cramer thinks not Carlos Jasso | Reuters \nAfter a year of market chatter about the Republican tax overhaul already being \"baked in\" to the market, Cramer came out in full force against the claim. \nAs the \"Mad Money\" host reviewed Wall Street's latest research on Wednesday, he noticed an unusually high number of analyst upgrades and an unusually low number of downgrades. \nCompared to the typical 10 upgrades and 5 downgrades, Cramer counted 29 upgrades of import and only two downgrades. The common thread? \n\"Tax reform. That's right, the very event that was supposedly baked into the [market], that all the graybeards ... said was being overblown, is proving to be the main reason for most of these positive analyst reports and upgrades,\" Cramer said. \nThe strangest part? The upgrades are actually boosting stocks , Cramer said. Children's Place: Still a buy? Scott Mlyn | CNBC A sign outside The Children's Place store in Irvine, California. \nIt's not often that Cramer gives a positive take on a pure-play retail stock, but on Wednesday, he made an exception for one name that recently caught fire: Children's Place . \nShares of the children's apparel retailer didn't see much action for most of 2017. But in the last 10 weeks of the year, the stock caught fire, flying 44 percent as part of a larger retail comeback. \n\"What's really intriguing is not that the stock vaulted into the stratosphere when retail came back into style on the Wall Street fashion show, it's that the company managed to do so well for so long even when other retailers were struggling,\" Cramer said. \nWith over 1,000 stores in the United States and Canada and another 168 overseas, mostly located in shopping malls, it came as a surprise to Cramer that Children's Place managed to shirk the \"death of the mall\" commentary that plagued retail for much of 2017. Mindbody CEO on making wellness businesses 'durable' Scott Mlyn | CNBC Rick Stollmeyer, CEO, Mindbody \nThe beginning of the year is typically a fruitful time for Mindbody , a cloud-based provider of business management software that serves the health and wellness space. \nThe company helps businesses like spas, wellness centers, fitness studios and gyms \u2014 often hubs for New-Year's-resolution-followers \u2014 organize their administrative structures and send new customers their way via Mindbody's app. \n\"What it's really about is solving for two problems,\" Rick Stollmeyer, the co-founder, chairman and CEO of Mindbody, told Cramer in a Wednesday interview. \"First of all, there needs to be a robust, continuously growing supply of wellness services. And these businesses are not easy to run.\" \nStollmeyer's wife and nephew both run wellness businesses in partnership with Mindbody, which gave the CEO an intimate look into the complexity of the services they provide. \n\"But once they get the right target audience and once they understand how they're going to deliver their services in a predictable way, they are really quite durable,\" Stollmeyer said. \"And so what we're able to do is give them a business management system that solves their fundamental problems and then connect them to a much larger audience and get more people in the door. Because if you've got 20 spin bikes and you've only filled 15 of them, that last five is lost forever. It's lost income.\" \nThe company's latest venture? Introducing dynamic pricing like Uber's to provide more options to price-sensitive customers. For more, see Stollmeyer's full interview here . An optimistic market Getty Images \nCramer has noticed an interesting trend developing in this bull market when certain stocks get hit with negative news. \n\"Normally, negatives linger or create prolonged sell-offs.

This was rejected,\" one of the sources, a government official, said. \"It is up to Boeing to come back with a new proposal.\" \nBoeing's proposed tie-up with Embraer, the world's third largest planemaker, would give it a leading share of the 70- to 130-seat market and create stiffer competition for the CSeries program designed by Canada's Bombardier Inc and run by European rival Airbus SE since last year. \nSince the news broke last month that it was in talks with Boeing, Embraer's shares are up 22 percent in New York, where 51 percent of its stock is listed, bringing its market capitalization to $4.6 billion. \nBoeing's proposal would value the company at $5 billion to $6 billion, a person familiar with the negotiations said. \nYet Boeing's plan has snagged on concerns in Brasilia that Washington would get final say over Brazilian defense programs and use of technology developed in the country, including satellite and air-traffic control systems. \nThe Brazilian government holds a 'golden share' in Embraer giving it veto power over strategic decisions involving military programs and any change in its controlling interest. \nBoeing would be willing to preserve the government's golden share in Embraer, the people familiar with the matter said, but that may not be enough to win support. \nEmbraer said it would not comment on the matter and representatives for Boeing and the Defense Ministry, which is coordinating talks with the government, did not immediately reply to requests for comment. \nAIR FORCE RESISTANCE \nOfficials at the Finance Ministry and development bank BNDES, which owns 5 percent of the planemaker, have been supportive of the deal, but military officials are far more skeptical, according to the sources. The BNDES declined comment and the ministry did not reply. \n\"The Air Force is the main source of resistance, said an aide to President Michel Temer. \"The military oppose any split up of Embraer.\" He said Jungmann has yet to make a recommendation on a Boeing deal to the president. \nIn an emailed comment, the Air Force said it \"considers Embraer a strategic company that is fundamental for our national sovereignty, so a possible partnership with Boeing should be studied from this point of view\". \nAir Force commander Lt Brig Nivaldo Luiz Rossato joined Defense Minister Raul Jungmann last week in Brasilia at a meeting with senior Boeing executives including Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith, which failed to sway the Brazilians. \nEmbraer's special relationship with Brazil's Air Force dates back to its creation in the 1960s as part of a government push to create a domestic aviation industry. The planemaker was opened to private capital in 1994 and fully privatized in 2006, but it still works closely with the Air Force, which is now financing development of the KC-390 military airlifter. \nBoeing, which struck a joint sales and services agreement on the KC-390, has underscored to officials that a tie-up would help to market Embraer's defense products globally and bolster Brazil's nascent space program, one person said. \nYet government officials are still steering Boeing toward a more narrow joint venture with Embraer focused on commercial aviation a prospect at which Boeing has turned up its nose, according to two people familiar with the talks. \nNeither the government nor the companies want to entirely split off Embraer's commercial or defense operations, given the integration of their technology and engineering resources, the sources said. \nWith a presidential election looming in Brazil this year and airlines delaying orders until the shape of the industry is clear, all sides of the negotiations are eager for a resolution. Yet government officials seem keen on pressing their hand. \n\"We think Boeing will end up agreeing to a partnership or a joint venture because they have been weakened by the Airbus-Bombardier deal,\" said the official familiar with the talks. \"They have no other possible partner and need a quick fix.\" \n(Reporting by Brad Haynes and Anthony Boadle; Additional reporting by Ricardo Brito and Jake Spring; Editing by Christian Plumb and Susan Thomas)"}

Carried interest has been U.S. law for more than 50 years as an incentive for long-term investment.\nTop Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn said last month after the Republican tax bill was finalized that he regretted that carried interest was not cut.\n\"We would have cut carried interest,\" Cohn told Axios at the time . \"We probably tried 25 times.\"\nAsked about the importance of companies possibly being incentivized to bring back some of the nearly $3 trillion held overseas, Fink said, \"Bringing money back is to me is not that significant.\"\nMeanwhile, the U.S. corporate tax cut is a problem for Mexico because the rate is now lower in America, Fink said. Companies that had domiciled in Mexico for tax reasons are going to make their new tax homes in the U.S., he predicts.\nOn the markets, Fink said BlackRock is still \"quite bullish\" on stocks.\nThe BlackRock chairman and CEO also said retirement savers, even as old as 50 , should mostly be in stocks rather than bonds. That advice is counter to conventional asset allocation wisdom that long-term investors should have a portion of their portfolios in bonds.\nFink's comments came shortly after BlackRock reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, and said that assets under management exceeded $6 trillion.\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising\/Marketing Automotive Communications\/PR Construction\/Manufacturing Education Finance\/Banking\/Insurance Legal Media\/Entertainment Medical\/Health Care Mining\/Oil\/Gas\/Utilities Gov't\/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology\/IT Transportation\/Shipping Travel\/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.

Playing games Gates plays the card game Bridge and the board game Settlers of Catan.\n\"My parents first taught me bridge, but I really started to enjoy it after playing with Warren Buffett,\" Gates writes in Time of his billionaire bestie. \"It takes a mix of strategy and teamwork to do well. We always find time to play a few games when we're together.\"\nBuffett himself spends eight hours per week playing bridge, and tells the Washington Post , \"It's the best exercise there is for the brain.\" Buffett even sees lessons in business mirrored in bridge, telling CBS News , \"You have to look at all the facts. You have to draw inferences from what you've seen, what you've heard. You have to discard improper theories about what the hand had as more evidence comes in sometimes.\"\n\nAs for Settlers of Catan , \"This civilization-building board game is a favorite in my family,\" Gates writes. \"Melinda, our kids, and I have spent many hours sitting around the table trading resources, building roads, and strategizing to be the first to reach 10 victory points.\"\nGates and Buffett may be on to something: 2014 research by the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that embracing cognitive activities like playing card games is beneficial to brain health, according to The New York Times .\n2. Exercising  A trip to the tennis court is a way Gates relaxes. \"I have played tennis my whole life,\" he writes.\nFellow billionaire Richard Branson is also a tennis fanatic , and says lessons he's learned on the court also translate to success in business. \n\"One key lesson I've learned, which applies far beyond the court, is to treat each point separately,\" Branson writes in a post on LinkedIn. \"Forget the last mistake and move onto the next challenge. Tennis, like business, moves so quickly that if you dwell on the past for even a few minutes, an opportunity will have passed and the moment will be lost.\"\nGates and Branson are in good company: other business leaders like Mark Zuckerberg, Oprah Winfrey and Mark Cuban prioritize staying active. \n\"Staying in shape is very important,\" Zuckerberg says in a Q&A on Facebook . \"Doing anything well requires energy, and you just have a lot more energy when you're fit.\"\n3. Reading books Gates is well known to be a voracious reader . \n\"On average, I try to read a book a week, and I always bring a whole tote bag of them on vacation,\" Gates writes for Time. \nWhile Gates may find it relaxing, he's also enjoying the science backed benefits of reading . For example, research published by Stanford found that close reading of a novel increased blood flow to underused areas of the brain. \nDedicating time to reading can also be critical for success in your career, according to Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban . While \"most people won't put in the time to get a knowledge advantage,\" Cuban writes on his blog , he tries to spend three hours a day reading to stay sharp. \nFor Buffett, that means spending \"five or six hours a day reading,\" he says in HBO's documentary, \" Becoming Warren Buffett .\"\n4. Exploring the globe Lastly, Gates makes time to travel. One trip in particular had a life changing impact, he tells Time.\n\"In 1993, Melinda and I visited Tanzania, Kenya, and Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo),\" he writes. \"That trip changed our lives and inspired us to start our foundation and get involved in philanthropy sooner than we planned.\"\nSamantha Reinders | Gates Foundation Sue Desmond-Hellmann in Tanzania with Bill Gates.

Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty Images \"Little Rocket Man\" \nTrump has been antagonizing Kim Jong Un over Twitter for months in reference to the North Korean leader's determination to acquire nuclear weapons. Composite Image | Getty Images | Reuters \"Al Frankenstien\" \nTrump piped up over Twitter to comment on sexual misconduct claims against Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., misspelling Frankenstein in the process. \"The Failing New York Times\" \nOne of the president's favorite targets for his Twitter wrath is The New York Times. Ty Wright | Bloomberg | Getty Images \"Liddle' Bob Corker\" \nTrump took a jab at Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., after Corker said in \"The Failing New York Times\" that Trump's leadership style would set the country \"on the path to World War III.\" Tom Williams | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images \"Pocahontas\" \nThere is no love lost between Trump and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Trump recently referred to Warren as \"Pocahontas\" during a White House ceremony honoring Native Americans who fought in World War II. Robyn Beck | AFP | Getty Images \"Fake Tears Chuck\" \nTrump has often blasted his Democratic foes in Congress, including Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who have consistently taken a stance against the administration's agenda. Tom Williams | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images \"Jeff Flake(y)\" \nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., earned the nickname \"Flake(y)\" after his criticism of the president was caught on a hot mic during an ABC interview. Matt McClain | The Washington Post | Getty Images \"Psycho Joe\" and \"Crazy Mika\" \nThe duo on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" are often in the crosshairs of Trump's tweets. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters \"Crooked Hillary\" \nTrump created this nickname during the 2016 presidential race, referring to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of email during her tenure at the State Department. The nickname continues to stick and is used often even as his own administration remains the focus of special counsel Bob Mueller's investigation into Russian collusion. Rick Wilking-Pool | Getty Images \"Lyin' Ted\" \nPresidential candidate Trump attacked his closest opponent, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, during the GOP primaries. The two have often been at odds since Trump took office. Al Drago | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images \"Crazy Bernie\" \nThe challenge by Sen.

Getty Images \"Little Marco\" \nThe president often referred to his GOP primary opponent Sen.

Jeb Bush was often the target of Trump's tweets when the two candidates were competing in the GOP primaries. "}

Bitcoin fell through that level on Wednesday. Other data puts the 100-day closer to $9,000. According to CNBC.com's chart, Bitcoin hit a low Wednesday of $9,230, less than half its all-time high reached in December. It was just above $10,000 in afternoon trading, down about 13.5 percent.\n\"It held the 100-day, which it hasn't been below in over two years,\" said T3Live.com partner Scott Redler, who follows short term technicals.\n\"Bitcoin is testing an important level\u2026.Bitcoin is searching for a spot to find support.

Redler uses Tradeview data.\n\"So if the bounce is 'feeble' off the 100-day, the 200-day is usually the likely spot. We'll see if the 50-day that was support for the past year turns into resistance,\" he said. The 200-day moving average is around $7,100.\nRedler said bitcoin's chart had flashed a major warning.\n\"I was very cautious on it when it broke $17,000 because it broke the momentum trend ,\" he said, adding it is looking to be at a more constructive level now.\n\nSource: T3Live.com"}

{"published":"2018-01-25T21:23:00.000+02:00","title":"Trump wants to talk taxes in Davos. But the rest of the world is less enthusiastic","text":"The overhaul of America's tax code is being met with consternation abroad, as foreign leaders face growing pressure to slash their own tax rates and warn that key provisions in the new U.S. law could violate international treaties.\nEurope's most powerful finance ministers have alerted Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that they have \"significant concerns\" with the law and fear it could lead to distortions in trade and investment. In Australia, Treasurer Scott Morrison estimates that the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate could dampen his country's economic growth by 1 percent. Canada's finance minister acknowledged Wednesday that America's move is forcing officials to take a hard look at their own tax laws.\n\"We need to do our homework,\" Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. \"We are doing the analysis to look at ensuring that our situation for corporations continues to be competitive.\"\nThe simmering tension over taxes is just one of many potential flashpoints between world leaders and President Donald Trump as they convened Thursday in the snowy mountain resort of Davos for the annual gathering of the global elite. There are new U.S. tariffs on solar energy and washing machines , reports of disparaging comments about African nations and loose talk by Mnuchin about the strength of the dollar .\nBut Trump's main mission is to tout the benefits of the sweeping new tax plan on an international stage \u2013 the record highs of the stock markets, the steady drumbeat of big companies announcing employee bonuses and the billions of dollars in investment that Trump promises will return to America.\n\"The economy is doing very well,\" Trump told reporters Wednesday as he prepared for departure. \"I am going to Davos to get them to bring back a lot of money.\"\nThat is exactly what is making other countries worried.\nThe new law dramatically reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to just 21 percent \u2013 from the highest statutory rates in the world to one of the lowest. France's rate is 34 percent. Japan, Mexico and Germany are at 30 percent. Norway's is 24 percent.\nSonja Gibbs, a senior director at the Institute of International Finance, said the salvo from the United States could set off a race to the bottom to cut tax taxes that ultimately leads to higher global debt and, potentially, market instability. Already, business groups in Canada are calling for their government to follow suit, and officials in China have announced measures to shore up their tax system.\n\"The concern is certainly very widespread,\" Gibbs said. \"I don't think there is a national capital anywhere in the world that isn't thinking about this right now.\"\nSpeaking in Davos on Thursday, Mnuchin pushed back against the notion that the United States had sparked a tax-cutting frenzy.\n\"We're not looking for a race to the bottom,\" he said. \"We restructured around having a system that encourages our companies to do business in tax havens that had very low rates. We've transformed the system away from that to encourage people to invest in the U.S., bring jobs to the U.S., and we couldn't be more pleased with that.\"\nConcerns beyond corporate tax cuts It's not only the corporate rate that concerns other countries, however. The new law also introduced a new and untested method for taxing foreign earnings of American companies that officials say might run afoul of agreements under the World Trade Organization.\nUnder America's old regime, foreign earnings were subject to the headline corporate tax rate of 35 percent \u2013 but only once it was brought back to the United States. That system resulted in a buildup of more than $2 trillion in deferred offshore earnings and encouraged complicated schemes, such as earnings stripping and inversions, to avoid paying U.S. taxes.\nThe new law institutes a one-time mandatory repatriation tax on that stockpile. In the future, overseas earnings generally will not be subject to U.S. tax \u2013 but with a significant exception. The law creates a new global minimum tax of 10.5 percent on earnings above so-called \"routine profits,\" which are defined as 10 percent of a company's tangible assets. The provision is intended to target industries such as tech and pharmaceuticals that can easily shift income to minimize their tax burden.\nIn addition, new rules aimed at protecting America's tax base impose a minimum 10 percent tax on income that U.S. companies earn from doing business with foreign firms. The move is supposed to prevent foreign multinationals from claiming large deductions for products manufactured or consumed in America and then booking the profits overseas.\nPossible retaliation But analysts say the system is overly complicated and has not been vetted in the real world. As Congress scrambled to produce a bill in the final weeks of 2017, lawmakers left many of the thorny implementation questions to Treasury to sort out \u2013 a process that could take years.\n\"If it turns out this law is written in a way that actually has real teeth and for that reason ends up discriminating against foreign investors, you could very well see this being added to the WTO or other international forum,\" said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nIn December, finance ministers from Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy sent a letter to Mnuchin, congressional leadership and top White House officials warning that the measure \"would impact on genuine commercial arrangements which pose minimal risk to the U.S. tax base.\"\n\"We also see the possibility that some of the proposed measures could constitute unfair trade practice and may discourage non-U.S. financial institutions from operating in the U.S.,\" the letter read.\nThe European Commission followed up with a similar letter to Mnuchin a day later. A person familiar with the exchange said the EC has not yet received a reply. A commission representative said it \"will reflect on all possible measures that may need to be taken if the bill enters into force as agreed.\"\n\"All options are on the table,\" she said."}

Gudeman responded with skepticism, saying the coworker had provided \"zero evidence\" for the claim and suggesting the FBI may have had justification.\nA human resources employee later told Gudeman he had accused his coworker of terrorism based on religion, and that he was being fired as a result, the lawsuit said.

Germany needs new political blood,\" she told CNBC.\nshow chapters Germany needs 'new political blood': Pro      13 Hours Ago | 03:22 The SPD is hosting a party conference Sunday, when approval should be given for official coalition talks to begin. But analysts do not expect a government to be sworn in before Easter.\n\"Once this stage (the party conference) has been passed, it is very unlikely that the coalition talks will still fail,\" Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for Germany and Austria at ING, said in a note Friday. \"The current paper is already too detailed for any huge surprises to happen.\"\nBrzeski added, however, that there have been surprises in German politics over the last few months, indicating that there could be new unexpected developments between the CDU and the SPD.\nNonetheless, the potential coalition government will likely prove complicated for Merkel. \"The difficulties to reach the current compromise show that any new grand coalition will not be the result of love at first sight, but rather a coalition of convenience,\" Brzeski said.\nThe CDU's talks with the SPD are only taking place because Merkel's previous attempt to form a coalition failed. Furthermore, the SPD had to retract its campaign promise that it would not join forces with Merkel.\nSteffi Loos | Getty Images German Chancellor and head of the German Christian Democrats (CDU) Angela Merkel during statements following all-night preliminary coalition talks on January 12, 2018 in Berlin, Germany. \"I think no matter what the outcome of the coalition agreement is, or even if there is no coalition agreement and we are looking at a minority government or snap elections, Germany is heading in a certain direction,\" Schick said, noting that not only will Merkel be in her fourth term, but also her 12th year in office.\n\"If you look at the precedents (of previous chancellors)...they often struggled in their fourth year,\" she said. \"So no matter what happens, Merkel is diminished.\"\n\"How badly she is diminished really depends on the outcome of the coalition talks. So I foresee a situation, which is quite plausible, where she might actually have to step down before she served the full remainder of her term,\" Schick said.\nIf Merkel, who is often seen as a main driving force in European politics, loses some of her authority, this could have repercussions at a continental level.\n\"Merkel's diminished power means that any grand step forward towards euro zone integration is hampered,\" Schick said."}

{"published":"2018-01-04T16:40:00.000+02:00","title":"Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end policy that let legal pot flourish","text":"Attorney General Jeff Sessions has rescinded an Obama -era policy that paved the way for legalized marijuana to flourish in states across the country, creating new confusion about enforcement and use just three days after a new legalization law went into effect in California.\nPresident Donald Trump 's top law enforcement official announced the change Thursday. Instead of the previous lenient-federal-enforcement policy, Sessions' new stance will instead let federal prosecutors where marijuana is legal decide how aggressively to enforce longstanding federal law prohibiting it.\nSessions' plan drew immediate strong objection from Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, one of eight states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use.\nGardner said in a tweet that the Justice Department \"has trampled on the will of the voters\" in Colorado and other states. He said the action would contradict what Sessions had told him before the attorney general was confirmed and that he was prepared \"to take all steps necessary\" to fight the step including holding up the confirmation of Justice Department nominees.\nCory Gardner tweet 1: .@realdonaldtrump had it right. This must be left up to the states.\nCory Gardner tweet 2: I am prepared to take all steps necessary, including holding DOJ nominees, until the Attorney General lives up to the commitment he made to me prior to his confirmation.\nSessions rescinded the policy by president Barack Obama's Justice Department that has generally barred federal law enforcement officials from interfering with marijuana sales in states where the drug is legal.\nshow chapters US to end policy that let legal marijuana flourish 4 Hours Ago | 00:58 \"In deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute under these laws with the Department's finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions,\" by considering the seriousness of the crime and its impact on the community, Sessions wrote in a one-page memo to the nation's federal prosecutors.\nThe move by Trump's attorney general likely is sure to add to confusion about whether it's OK to grow, buy or use marijuana in states where the drug is legal.\nIt comes just after shops opened in California, launching what is expected to become the world's largest market for legal recreational marijuana and as polls show a solid majority of Americans believe the drug should be legal.\nWhile Sessions has been carrying out a Justice Department agenda that follows Trump's top priorities on such issues as immigration and opioids, the changes to marijuana policy reflect his own concerns. Trump's personal views on marijuana remain largely unknown.\nSessions, who has assailed marijuana as comparable to heroin and has blamed it for spikes in violence, had been expected to ramp up enforcement. Marijuana advocates argue that legalizing the drug eliminates the need for a black market and will likely reduce violence, since criminals would no longer control the marijuana trade.\nThe Obama administration in 2013 announced it would not stand in the way of states that legalize marijuana, so long as officials acted to keep it from migrating to places where it remained outlawed and keep it out of the hands of criminal gangs and children. Sessions is rescinding that memo, written by then-Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole, which had cleared up some of the uncertainty about how the federal government would respond as states began allowing sales for recreational and medical purposes.\nThe marijuana business has since become a sophisticated, multimillion-dollar industry that helps fund some government programs. Eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use, and California's sales alone are projected to bring in $1 billion annually in tax revenue within several years.\nBut the Sessions Justice Department believed the Cole memo created a \"safe harbor\" for marijuana sales that are federally illegal, Justice Department officials said. Sessions in the memo called the Obama guidance \"unnecessary.\"\nSessions' policy will let U.S. attorneys across the country decide what kinds of federal resources to devote to marijuana enforcement based on what they see as priorities in their districts. Officials couldn't say what the ultimate impact will be on the legal industry or whether it will lead to more pot prosecutions.\nNor is it clear how the memo might affect states where marijuana is legal for medical purposes. A congressional amendment blocks the Justice Department from interfering with medical marijuana programs in states where it is allowed. Justice officials said they would follow the law, but would not preclude the possibility of medical-marijuana related prosecutions.\nSessions and some law enforcement officials in states such as Colorado blame legalization for a number of problems, including drug traffickers who have taken advantage of lax marijuana laws to illegally grow and ship the drug across state lines, where it can sell for much more. The decision was a win for marijuana opponents who had been urging Sessions to take action.\n\"There is no more safe haven with regard to the federal government and marijuana, but it's also the beginning of the story and not the end,\" said Kevin Sabet, president and CEO of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, who was among several anti-marijuana advocates who met with Sessions last month. \"This is a victory. It's going to dry up a lot of the institutional investment that has gone toward marijuana in the last five years.\"\nThreats of a federal crackdown have united liberals who object to the human costs of a war on pot with conservatives who see it as a states' rights issue. Some in law enforcement support a tougher approach, but a bipartisan group of senators in March urged Sessions to uphold existing marijuana policy. Others in Congress have been seeking ways to protect and promote legal pot businesses.\nMarijuana advocates quickly condemned Sessions' move as a return to outdated drug-war policies that unduly affected minorities.\nSessions \"wants to maintain a system that has led to tremendous injustice ... and that has wasted federal resources on a huge scale,\" said Maria McFarland Sanchez-Moreno, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance. \"If Sessions thinks that makes sense in terms of prosecutorial priorities, he is in a very bizarre ideological state, or a deeply problematic one.\"\nA task force Sessions convened to study pot policy made no recommendations for upending the legal industry but instead encouraged Justice Department officials to keep reviewing the Obama administration's more hands-off approach to marijuana enforcement, something Sessions promised to do since he took office.\nThe change also reflects yet another way in which Sessions, who served as a federal prosecutor at the height of the drug war in Mobile, Alabama, has reversed Obama-era criminal justice policies that aimed to ease overcrowding in federal prisons and contributed to a rethinking of how drug criminals were prosecuted and sentenced. While his Democratic predecessor Eric Holder told federal prosecutors to avoid seeking long mandatory minimum sentences when charging certain lower-level drug offenders, for example, Sessions issued an order demanding the opposite, telling them to pursue the most serious charges possible against most suspects."}

Under the terms of the agreement, Celgene will pay approximately $1.1 billion upfront and up to $1.25 billion in contingent payments based on regulatory approval milestones for myelofibrosis. Additional future payments for regulatory approvals in additional indications and sales-based milestones are also possible.\nFedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, was evaluated in 877 patients across 18 clinical trials. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III pivotal trial (JAKARTA-1) for patients with treatment-na\u00efve myelofibrosis, fedratinib demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the primary and secondary endpoints of splenic response and total symptom score, respectively. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, these improvements were observed regardless of a patient\u2019s baseline platelet count.\nA multi-center, single-arm phase II trial (JAKARTA-2) evaluated fedratinib in myelofibrosis patients who were found to be resistant or intolerant to ruxolitinib (Jakafi \u00ae ), a JAK1\/JAK2 inhibitor. In this second-line setting, fedratinib demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in splenic response and total symptom score.\nAs previously reported, JAKARTA-2 was stopped prematurely due to a clinical hold placed on the fedratinib program by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after potential cases of Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy (WE) were reported in eight out of 877 patients receiving one or more doses (less than one percent of treated patients). The FDA removed the clinical hold in August 2017.\nBased on the reported benefit risk profile of fedratinib from the JAKARTA-1 and JAKARTA-2 clinical trials, regulatory applications in myelofibrosis are planned beginning in the middle of 2018.\n\u201cMyelofibrosis is a disease with high unmet medical need as the number of patients who are ineligible for or become resistant to existing therapy continues to increase,\u201d said Nadim Ahmed, President, Hematology and Oncology for Celgene. \u201cWe believe fedratinib is uniquely positioned as a potential treatment for myelofibrosis and it provides strategic options for us to build leadership in this disease with luspatercept and other pipeline assets.\u201d\n\u201cWe launched Impact Biomedicines and based on our thorough review of the data, fedratinib presents a compelling risk benefit profile in both treatment-na\u00efve patients and patients who are resistant or intolerant to other JAK2 therapies,\u201d said Dr. John Hood, Chief Executive Officer of Impact. \u201cWe believe Celgene is the ideal organization to follow through on our mission of maximizing fedratinib\u2019s potential for patients with myelofibrosis.\u201d\nDeal Terms\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Celgene will make an upfront cash payment of approximately $1.1 billion. In addition, Impact Biomedicines\u2019s shareholders are eligible to receive contingent payments based on regulatory approval and sales-based milestones. The maximum aggregate amount payable for regulatory approval milestones is $1.4 billion relating to approvals for myelofibrosis and other indications. Starting from global annual net sales of $1.0 billion, aggregate tiered sales-based milestone payments could total a maximum of $4.5 billion if global annual net sales exceed $5.0 billion.\nCredit Suisse acted as financial advisor and Hogan Lovells acted as legal counsel to Celgene on the transaction. PJT Partners acted as exclusive financial advisor and Latham & Watkins acted as exclusive legal counsel to Impact Biomedicines on the transaction. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.\nAbout Celgene\nCelgene Corporation, headquartered in Summit, New Jersey, is an integrated global biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases through next-generation solutions in protein homeostasis, immuno-oncology, epigenetics, immunology and neuro-inflammation.

The 32-year-old serial entrepreneur just sold Shipt \u2014 the same-day grocery delivery business he founded in Birmingham, Ala. in 2014 \u2014 to Target for $550 million . \nHere, the self-made millionaire and businessman tells CNBC Make It the two books that have helped him find success. \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" \n\"Before I really started my first business, I read ' Rich Dad Poor Dad ,'\" Smith tells CNBC Make It. In the book, author Robert Kiyosaki writes about the two father figures in his life and how they shaped his views on personal finance. But the book also had personal significance for Smith. \n\"It's kind of a story about the one dad that has a PhD and this fancy college education, and the guy next door just works hard and goes out and hustles every day, and he's the rich dad. \n\"That kind of made me feel like 'Hey I don't really need to have to college to go make stuff happen. I can go do this,' so that was an important book to me.\" \nSmith dropped out of high school and then after receiving his GED, went to college for a brief stint but never finished. Smith says he thinks education is great, but not necessary to be an entrepreneur. \n\"I think that business is all about getting out there and solving problems, and I don't know if you can really teach entrepreneurship,\" Smith says. \"So I just tell people you gotta get out there and start making it happen.\" \nSmith isn't the only successful person who has touted the benefits of the book. NFL wide receiver Ryan Broyles recently revealed that he and his wife lived on roughly $60,000 a year throughout his career, despite having once signed a $3.6 million contract with the Detroit Lions. (He is currently a free agent.) Lessons Broyles learned from the popular book focused on how to make your money work for you. \n\"The Poor Dad's philosophy basically reinforced the way I already thought about money: Make money to live, and save some along the way,\" Broyles wrote in The Players' Tribune . \"But the Rich Dad's lessons \u2014 making your money work for you by investing it and acquiring income-generating assets \u2014 made me realize that I needed to make changes in how I thought about money if I ever wanted to be that Rich Dad.\" \"Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap and Others Don't\" \n\"I really enjoyed 'Good to Great,' which is a little bit of an older book now, but it's a good book about how to build companies that can stand the test of time,\" Smith tells CNBC Make It of the tome by Jim Collins. \nSmith is in good company; Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of e-commerce behemoth Amazon, has also reportedly credited the book for helping shape his leadership style and way of thinking. Amazon executives were briefed by author Collins on many of the principles laid out in the book before its publication, according to Brad Stone , who wrote a biography on Bezos. \nThe book analyzes companies that make the leap from good results to great results and then are able to sustain that success.

It still trades at around a 30 percent premium compared to other countries.\nBitcoin BTC=BTSP was down more than 10 percent on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp at $13,199, after earlier dropping as low as $13,120, its weakest since Jan. 2.\nSouth Korea\u2019s cryptocurrency-related shares were also hammered. Vidente ( 121800.KQ ) and Omnitel ( 057680.KQ ), which are stakeholders of Bithumb, skidded by the daily trading limit of 30 percent each.\nOnce enforced, South Korea\u2019s ban \u201cwill make trading difficult here, but not impossible,\u201d said Mun Chong-hyun, chief analyst at EST Security.\n\u201cKeen traders, especially hackers, will find it tough to cash out their gains from virtual coin investments in Korea but they can go overseas, for example Japan,\u201d Mun said.\nPark Nok-sun, a cryptocurrency analyst at NH Investment & Securities, said the herd behaviour in South Korea\u2019s virtual coin market has raised concerns.\nIndeed, bitcoin's BTC=BTSP 1,500 percent surge last year has stoked huge demand for cryptocurency in South Korea, drawing college students to housewives and sparking worries of a gambling addiction.\nSlideshow (4 Images) \u201cSome officials are pushing for stronger and stronger regulations because they only see more (investors) jumping in, not out,\u201d Park said.\nBy Thursday afternoon, the Justice Ministry\u2019s announcement had prompted more than 55,000 South Koreans to join a petition asking the presidential Blue House to halt the crackdown on the virtual currency, making the Blue House website intermittently unavailable due to heavy traffic, the website showed.\nREGULATORY CONUNDRUM There are more than a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, according to Korea Blockchain Industry Association.\nThe proliferation of the virtual currency and the accompanying trading frenzy have raised eyebrows among regulators globally, though many central banks have refrained from supervising cryptocurrencies themselves.\nThe news of South Korea\u2019s proposed ban came as authorities tightened their grip on some cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe nation\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinone and Bithumb were raided by police and tax agencies this week for alleged tax evasion. The raids follow moves by the finance ministry to identify ways to tax the market that has become as big as the nation\u2019s small-cap Kosdaq index in terms of daily trading volume.\nSome investors appeared to have taken preemptive action.\n\u201cI have already cashed most of mine (virtual coins) as I was aware that something was coming up in a couple of days,\u201d said Eoh Kyung-hoon, a 23-year old investor.\nBitcoin sank on Monday after website CoinMarketCap removed prices from South Korean exchanges, because coins were trading at a premium of about 30 percent in Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy. That created confusion and triggered a broad selloff among investors.\nAn official at Coinone told Reuters that a few officials from the National Tax Service raided the company\u2019s office this week.

No injuries were reported. \nRepresentatives of the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) in Okinawa did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nResentment has simmered among residents of the southern island who bemoan what they see as an unfair burden in supporting the U.S. military presence in Japan. \nAmong recent incidents, a USMC transport helicopter made an emergency landing on an Okinawan beach on Saturday because of a faulty rotor. Earlier, a window fell from a military aircraft onto a school playground. \nSuch accidents, as well as occasional incidents of crime committed by U.S. service personnel, have fuelled opposition to the U.S. presence on the island. \nLocated strategically at the edge of the East China Sea, Okinawa, which was under U.S. occupation until 1972, hosts some 30,000 military personnel living and working on bases that cover a fifth of the island.

{"published":"2018-01-24T13:00:00.000+02:00","title":"Enough with the doom and gloom. Retail and its real estate have bright spots","text":"SHARES Brian Sozzi The malls came alive this holiday season, and that is a good sign on the economy for 2015. \nRetail isn't just decades-old apparel brands and antiquated shopping malls. \nThe future for many industry names is bright and booming, despite dire headlines. And malls and shopping centers are taking on a new image of their own, bringing in experiential tenants and living spaces as department stores and other big-box anchors scale back. \n\"Store closures grabbed the headlines and drove the retail apocalypse narrative in 2017 and into 2018,\" said Deborah Weinswig, managing director of FGRT (formally Fung Global Retail & Technology). \nHowever, \"total in-store sales continued to grow, yielding an uplift in sales densities across US retail,\" she said. \"Moreover, occupancy rates in open-air shopping centers and superregional malls [more than 800,000 square feet in size] proved resilient.\" \nOpen-air centers in particular, which could be anchored by names like Dick's Sporting Goods , Whole Foods Market, Kohl's , Dollar Tree or TJ Maxx , are considered one of the \"most resilient retail real estate segments,\" according to FGRT. Retailers located there haven't been fleeing or breaking leases, as is the case at some regional malls, which tend to be about 400,000 to 800,000 square feet. \nMeanwhile, the top retail real estate owners in the U.S. \u2014 Simon Property Group , General Growth Properties , Kimco Realty , Brixmor Property Group and DDR \u2014 have maintained occupancy rates at or above 95 percent. That means less than 5 percent of spaces throughout their properties (a mix of malls and strip centers) are vacant. \n\"GGP and others have been dialing down their exposure to apparel specialty stores, and a number of these companies have focused on grocery-anchored centers or sought to bring in more grocery tenants to their existing centers,\" Weinswig wrote. \nFor now, grocery stores look to be a safe haven for real estate developers hoping to diversify their assets. But there's also a growing concern this trend could reverse as more shoppers opt to order their groceries online. \nNonetheless, the majority of store closures in 2017 stemmed from so-called softline retailers, which includes apparel brands, FGRT found in its report. In turn, regional malls have suffered the most from their peer group as names like Rue21, Ascena Retail Group and Gymboree shutter locations. \nWhile department stores also trimmed back, grocers, warehouse retailers and variety dollar stores have expanded across the country and are still filling in the gaps. \nThen, a fresh batch of tenants is changing the landscape even further. \nLawrence Group, a real estate developer with offices in St. Louis, just revealed it will be bringing Alamo Drafthouse and Punch Bowl Social, an upscale cinema and \"eatertainment\" venue, to anchor a massive mixed-use development called City Foundry STL in the city's historic midtown district. \n\"A lot of the retailers that we are talking to right now are saying, 'Once you deliver the food and entertainment tenants, then we are interested,'\" Lawrence Group Chief Executive Officer Steve Smith told CNBC. \"That's led us to landing some of these names (i.e. Alamo and Punch Bowl) earlier in the process.\" \nLocal food-and-beverage options coming to the site include a German beer hall and steakhouse lounge. The better blueprint for many retail real estate developers today is more dining, less apparel, a touch of experiential tenants, and popular brands such as Warby Parker, Lululemon , Untuckit and Ulta . \nOn the whole, St. Louis' midtown area \u2014 chiefly home to warehouses and other industrial spaces \u2014 is being reborn, with retail playing a major role in shaping the surrounding community. The same can be said for many retail redevelopment projects happening across the U.S. \n\"Retail follows rooftops,\" Smith said. And right now in St. Louis, residential space is sprawling. \nFor the remainder of this year, Weinswig expects purchases made at physical stores to strengthen so long as overall retail sales accelerate \u2014 online sales, led by internet behemoth Amazon , are still just a sliver of that total. \n\"Offline sales are made largely through physical stores,\" she said. Meanwhile, \"a number of major shopping-center owners are pivoting away from apparel specialist stores. ... Some are focusing on bringing in grocery and everyday-goods retailers, which are less vulnerable to e-commerce migration.\" \n(Note: Commercial real estate services group CBRE's Paul Fusz and Andrew Turf are handling retail leasing for City Foundry STL.)

The notion of a healthy U.S. economy was intact even after the Labor Department said on Friday employers added 148,000 workers last month, fewer than the 190,000 forecast by analysts polled by Reuters. Offsetting that though was a 0.3-percent increase in wages and a jobless rate holding at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. \"This still represents a solid labor market,\" said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the private client group of U.S. Bank in Helena, Montana. \"As investors were able to shift through the data, they concluded it is not a harbinger for weaker economic activity.\" Continued steady growth, which many analysts believe would be buttressed by the federal tax cuts passed in December, pushed Wall Street's major indexes to record highs on Friday. Appetite for stocks and other risky assets in the first week of 2018 has led to reduced holdings in U.S. government debt even as two-year Treasuries are yielding more than S&P 500 stocks . \"The higher (two-year) yield may entice some investors who see it meeting their income need, but it's not enough to derail the equity market in our view,\" Northey said. Moreover, the upward pressure on yields will likely persist due to debt supply. Companies issued $21.55 billion in U.S. high-grade bonds so far this week, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters unit. The U.S. Treasury Department will sell $56 billion in coupon-bearing debt next week, starting with a $24 billion auction in three-year notes on Tuesday. At 2:52 p.m. (1952 GMT), the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was up 2 basis point at 2.474 percent, within striking distance of the nine-month peak of 2.504 percent set on Dec. 21. The two-year yield, which is sensitive to traders' views on Fed policy, edged up 0.4 basis point to 1.960 percent. On Thursday, it reached 1.976 percent which was the highest since October 2008. In the futures market, federal funds contracts implied traders priced in two rate hikes in 2018 with the next one likely to occur in March.

FILE PHOTO: A stack of hay bales shaped as a tractor is seen in a field near Downham Market in Norfolk, in eastern England, October 20, 2016. REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo \nEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove, who spoke at two farming conferences in Oxford, also said the government would \u201clook at ways to support farmers who may choose to leave the industry.\u201d \nBritish farming is set for a radical overhaul after the country leaves the European Union in March 2019, when, for the first time in decades, the country will have a chance to create its own agricultural policy. \nFarmers in Britain will have to compete for government funds with departments such as health and education once Brussels hands over the purse strings for farming budgets to London. \nUnder the European Union\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), british farmers receive about 3 billion pounds a year in public funds. \nGove, who criticised the CAP\u2019s \u201cfundamentally flawed design\u201d, estimated that around 80 percent of the funding was based on the size of farmers\u2019 productive agricultural land. \n\u201cI think that money is poorly spent. Ultimately public money should go towards people who are thinking hard and working hard in order to ensure our environment is enhanced,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIf we are going to have 3 billion pounds spent then that money should be an investment in the future rather than an incentive to carry on just as people have been doing.\u201d \nThe new policy announced by Gove will apply only in England, after a transition period. Policies may differ in Scotland and Wales where devolved administrations control farm spending. FILE PHOTO: Farmers fields are seen above Gatwick airport near London Britain, April 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Phil Noble\/File Photo WARNING ON WORKFORCE \nGove said the current system of area-based funding, known as the basic payment scheme (BPS), would continue over a transition period in England after Britain leaves the EU to give farmers enough time to change their business model if necessary. \n\u201cAfter the transition, we will replace BPS with a system of public money for public goods,\u201d he said. FILE PHOTO: Workers planting Punkin's at Poskitts farm in Goole, Britain May 23, 2016. REUTERS\/Andrew Yates\/File Photo \nGove said BPS payments may continue until the end of 2024 although they would be reduced in England \u201ceither through a straight cap at the maximum level or through a sliding scale of reductions, to the largest payments first.\u201d \nOn average, British farmers get about 15,000 pounds a year from direct payments and an EU rural development fund. For some, direct payments account for 70 percent of their income. But a significant chunk goes to wealthy individuals who are large landowners. \nGove also warned farms and food companies that rely heavily on migrant labour while saying the government would pursue a \u201cflexible migration policy overall.\u201d \n\u201cIndustries which come to rely on importing cheap labour run the risk of failing to invest in the innovation required to become genuinely more productive,\u201d he said. \n\u201cLabour-intensive production inevitably lags behind capital intensive production.\u201d \nSince the June 2016 British vote to leave the EU, some farmers have reported difficulties in recruiting enough workers. \nGove said the British government would provide more details of its future agricultural policy in a document to be published in the spring.

REUTERS\/Susana Vera \nState prosecutors asked the Supreme Court to keep Junqueras in Estremera prison, outside Madrid, court officials said, which would prevent him from swearing in at the opening session of the new Catalan parliament on Jan. 17. \nA Dec. 21 regional election gave separatists a slim majority in the parliament in a blow to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who had hoped it would quash the Catalan independence movement and resolve Spain\u2019s worst political crisis in decades. \nJunqueras\u2019s Esquerra Republicana (Republican Left) party emerged as the second largest separatist group, a few seats behind former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont\u2019s Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) party. \nMarket-friendly party Ciudadanos (Citizens) won the most seats but other unionist parties did not secure enough votes to form a majority.

He is in custody on allegations of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. \nThe court said it would not reach a decision on Thursday. \nRajoy fired both Junqueras and Puigdemont when he imposed direct control over Catalonia after the separatist-controlled government declared independence following an Oct. 1 referendum on secession from Spain, which courts ruled illegal. \nThe political instability in Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of Spain\u2019s economy, has deterred tourists and prompted more than 3,000 companies, including the region\u2019s two biggest banks, to move their legal headquarters elsewhere in Spain.

A more immediate cause of the shutdown appears to have been President Trump's now-infamous \"shithole\" comment , which came during a meeting aimed at resolving a dispute over DACA, also known as the Dream Act for undocumented U.S. residents brought to the country as children. Trump's comment helped torpedo a deal that might have kept the government open.\nPresident Trump and other Republicans have tried to push back with the hashtag #DemocratShutdown, after Democrats objected to Republicans\u2019 treatment of both a DACA extension and funding for CHIP, the children's health insurance program.\nSome polls show that shouldering the blame for a government shutdown wasn't harmful to Republicans\u2019 electoral fates in 2013 or during the Clinton administration. President Trump this morning called the shutdown a 'present' from Democrats , and suggested the solution to Congressional gridlock was to elect even more Republicans in 2018.\nBut that mindset is a holdover from Republicans' longtime stance as an opposition party, at least at the federal level. It remains to be seen if voters have different expectations for a party that's actually responsible for running the government."}

Amazon (amzn) and Hulu scored just three nominations apiece. \nMeanwhile, Netflix (nflx) is second to only Time Warner\u2019s HBO (twx) in terms of TV category nods (nine to HBO\u2019s 12), while the streaming giant also picked up three big nominations in the film categories, including two for its original feature film Mudbound . \nA film category win at the Golden Globes would be a first for Netflix (which just won its first Academy Award last year in the documentary short category). The company continues to spend more and more on its original programming\u2014with roughly $8 billion earmarked for film and TV projects this year\u2014and, in Hollywood, one way to draw in more viewers is to make a splash during awards season. Having Mudbound become the first Netflix original feature film to compete at the Oscars would be a big deal for the streaming service, and a Golden Globes win (it\u2019s nominated for Best Original Song, and Mary J. Blige is nominated as a supporting actress) could be the first step. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. \nMeanwhile, on the television side, Netflix stands a solid chance of repeating last year\u2019s win the Best Drama category, with returning winner The Crown and popular sci-fi series Stranger Things both nominated again. Hulu\u2019s breakout hit The Handmaid\u2019s Tale will also challenge in that category, along with HBO\u2019s mega-popular Game of Thrones . And Netflix could also sweep two of the biggest TV categories if the Aziz Ansari comedy Master of None wins against competitors such as Amazon\u2019s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel in the \u201cmusical or comedy\u201d TV series category. \nAlong with Netflix, the recently-sold 21st Century Fox (fox) holds the best odds of walking away with more than a few Golden Globes on Sunday. Fox\u2019s (soon-to-be-owned-by-Disney) major movie studio, 20th Century Fox, and its indie movie distributor Fox Searchlight are nominated a combined 27 times (led by the feature film The Shape of Water \u2018s seven nominations), while the company\u2019s FX cable network scored eight nominations. \nThe Golden Globes will air on NBC (with a live-streamed pre-show on Facebook) this Sunday, January 7, emceed by Late Night host Seth Meyers.

Shares in most retail sector firms, which could benefit from the package\u2019s boost to consumer spending power, rose with major retailer Jarir up 2.6 percent to its highest since early October. \nThe information minister was quoted by the Al Sharq Al Awsat newspaper as saying the cost of this year\u2019s handouts, which include bonuses for state employees and the government paying value-added tax (VAT) on some items such as purchases of first homes, would total about 50 billion riyals ($13.3 bln). \nThat is about 1.9 percent of this year\u2019s projected gross domestic product. An additional 30 billion riyals would be spent this year on a previously announced aid programme for low- and middle-income Saudis. \nThe steps are unlikely to trigger a consumer boom. Private economists have estimated the government will raise about 40 billion riyals in 2018 by introducing VAT, while gasoline price hikes that took effect this month are expected to cost consumers tens of billions of riyals. \nBut the handouts are a sign that Saudi authorities are keen to limit damage to domestic demand from this year\u2019s austerity measures, and that rising oil prices are giving them the means to do so. \nShares in Saudi petrochemical producer PetroRabigh climbed 2.0 percent after the company said that of 12 units in its Phase II expansion, 10 had achieved production in line with specifications and the remaining two would start up in the current quarter. \nQatar\u2019s index rose 1.4 percent on the back of stocks including Barwa Real Estate, which gained 2.9 percent, and major Islamic bank Masraf Al Rayan, up 4.3 percent. \nQatari companies, which traditionally pay high dividend yields, are due to announce fourth-quarter or annual dividends in the next few weeks, and yields may be boosted this year by the fact that stock prices have been pushed lower by the economic embargo imposed by four Arab states on Qatar. \nMarkets in the United Arab Emirates were sluggish despite strength in global equities. Indexes in Dubai and Abu Dhabi both edged up 0.2 percent although Dubai builder Arabtec, which had been trading near six-year lows, jumped 6.5 percent in its heaviest trade since July after saying one of its units had won a 250 million dirham ($68 million) contract for work from blue chip Emaar Properties. \nEgypt\u2019s market was closed for a public holiday.

REUTERS\/ Aizhu Chen \nChina - already the biggest importer of oil and coal - is the world\u2019s third biggest user of natural gas behind the United States and Russia, but has to import around 40 percent of its total needs as domestic production can\u2019t keep up with demand. \nData compiled from the Thomson Reuters Eikon terminal indicates China\u2019s 2017 imports of pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) will top 67 million tonnes, up by more than a quarter from a year earlier. LNG imports alone surged more than 50 percent. \nThe data, which includes LNG tanker arrivals to China and pipeline monthly import flow estimates, is preliminary as December figures are not yet available. \nChina still lags Japan, with gas annual imports of around 83.5 million tonnes, all as LNG, but its overall gas imports topped Japan\u2019s in September and again in November, government data and shipping flows show. \nAnalysts say the trend is set and China should top Japan for the full year in 2018. \n\u201cBoth LNG and pipeline imports will continue to increase in the next few years. We expect China to overtake Japan as the world\u2019s largest gas importer in 2018,\u201d said Miaoru Huang, Asia gas and LNG senior manager at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. \n\u201cBut Japan will remain as the No.1 LNG importer till around 2028,\u201d she added. \nChina last year started to move millions of households and many industrial facilities from coal to gas as part of efforts to clean its skies, sparking an unprecedented rally in overseas import orders. \nChina\u2019s three biggest LNG suppliers are Australia, Qatar and Malaysia, while pipeline imports come from Central Asia and Myanmar. A pipeline connecting China to Russia is under construction. \nUnlike established LNG importers which import the bulk of their cargoes under long-term contracts with fixed monthly volumes and a link to the oil market, many Chinese utilities buy LNG in the spot market when they need it at short notice, such as the current peak demand winter season. \nAs a result, Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have more than doubled since June to $11.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their highest since November 2014, making LNG one of 2017\u2019s strongest performing commodities. \nChina\u2019s surging demand already pushed it past South Korea in 2017 as the world\u2019s number 2 LNG importer.

Were working hard on the farm bill and I think its going to go well. \nIn May Trump angered farm groups, which represent the rural voters who generally support his Republican Party, when he proposed cutting $46.54 billion in federal agricultural funding, mostly by capping the amount the government chips in toward crop insurance. There currently is no limit to the support the government gives farmers for insurance premiums. \nTrump, who swept Tennessee in the 2016 election, also signed an executive order after the speech to make it easier for the private sector to locate broadband infrastructure on federal land and buildings, part of a push to expand high-speed internet in rural America. Faster internet speeds in rural areas are often considered key to addressing the economic divide between rural and urban America, but the costs have so far been prohibitive. \nAbout 39 percent of rural Americans lack access to high- speed internet service, the Federal Communications Commission said in a 2016 report. \n\"We need to get rural America more connected. We need it for our tractors, we need it for our schools, we need it for our home-based businesses,\" a White House official told reporters ahead of Trump's speech. \nThe White House described the moves as an incremental step to help spur private development while the administration figures out how it can help with funding, something that could become part of Trump's plan to invest in infrastructure. \nThe CEO of the leading telecommunications trade group in the country, Jonathan Spalter, said USTelecom would push to ensure the government sets aside money for helping build and upgrade network infrastructure, as well as dismantling and streamlining regulations.

The fantasy reboot, which finds Johnson, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart transported into a video game world, has outperformed expectations, picking up a lordly $66.5 million over the holiday weekend. It now has a hefty $185.7 million domestic gross and should continue to draw crowds in 2018. The \"Jumanji\" sequel has also done well internationally, racking up $350 million worldwide, and has provided a much-needed hit for a studio that has struggled to keep pace with the Disney's and Warner Bros.'s of the world. Sony claims the film has a $90 million budget. Those alleged production costs have raised eyebrows around town as to their veracity given the film's Hawaii location and starry cast, but regardless of creative accounting and aggressive spinning, the result is impressive. A sequel seems preordained.\n\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" closed 2017 as the year's highest-grossing release and the seventh highest-grossing domestic movie of all time with $517.1 million. It will bypass its fellow franchisee \"Rogue One\" at some point on New Year's Day to take the seventh spot on the stateside charts and has already blown past the $1 billion mark globally. The film carries a $200 million price tag, and has generated controversy for a series of creative decisions by director and writer Rian Johnson that have, depending on your perspective, either infused new energy into decades-old series or deviated dangerously from the Jedi canon.\nIt's been a dismal year for the domestic box office, which ends 2017 with $11.12 billion in sales, down 2.3% from last year's $11.38 billion and off slightly from 2015's $11.14 billion, according to comScore. After a bruising summer, when revenues plummeted more than 6% in the wake of costly flops such as \"The Mummy\" and \"Transformer: The Last Knight,\" the gap did narrow. Fall and winter hits such as \"It,\" \"Thor: Ragnarok,\" \"Coco,\" and \"Murder on the Orient Express,\" helped make up the difference. The industry was also aided by record ticket prices. Empirically, fewer people made it to the multiplexes. Attendance is expected to hit a 27-year low when official numbers are tallied.\nUniversal's \"Pitch Perfect 3\" took third place on the stateside charts, grossing $22.7 million for the four-day period and pushing its domestic total to just under $70 million. The a Cappella comedy carries a $45 million production budget and has been billed as the final installment in the franchise.\nHugh Jackman's musical drama \"The Greatest Showman\" is finishing a close fourth with $20.7 million. The Fox-Chernin Entertainment production chronicles the rise of circus impresario P.T. Barnum. It got a boost from the holidays, and showed the biggest gain in the top 10 movies from the Christmas Eve weekend with an impressive 73% surge. The domestic total should hit $54.3 million through Monday. It's a pricey movie, though. All that singing and dancing didn't come cheap and \"The Greatest Showman\" cost $84 million to make.\nFox's second weekend of \"Ferdinand\" rounded out the top five with $14.6 million, giving the animated comedy $56.8 million domestically.\nNot every film was feeling the holiday spirit. Paramount's \"Downsizing\" is a costly bomb. The comedy about a man (Matt Damon) who shrinks to the size of thimble in order to live in a materialistic utopia collapsed at the box office, eking out $6.1 million over the long weekend. Its total stands at $18.5 million -- a paltry result given its $65 million budget. It also prolongs a box office losing streak for Damon. The actor also struck out with \"Suburbicon\" and \"The Great Wall,\" both of which opened during and flopped in 2017.\nWarner Bros. and Alcon's comedy \"Father Figures\" was another casualty of the Christmas crunch. The story of two twin brothers (Ed Helms and Owen Wilson) on a quest to find their biological father netted $5.1 million over the four-day weekend. Its total tops out at $14.1 million, making it unlikely that it will recoup its $25 million production budget as well its marketing costs.\nAnd Sony's \"All the Money in the World\" struggled to appeal to older audiences. The drama about the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III attracted lots of attention for the filmmakers' last minute decision to re-cast a key role played by disgraced actor Kevin Spacey. The breakneck reshoots took place in a matter of weeks, with Christopher Plummer assuming the Spacey part as parsimonious billionaire J. Paul Getty, and added $10 million to the film's $40 million budget. Alas, audiences failed to show up. The movie grossed $7.5 million over the holiday weekend, bringing its domestic total to $14.7 million.\nForeign audiences picked up the slack as domestic attendance sputtered in 2017. The global box office is projected to hit $40 billion for the first time in history, propelled by the return of China. Total ticket sales in the Middle Kingdom grew by 22.3%, ending the year with $8.6 billion in revenues. That, at least, gives a beleaguered movie business some cause for celebration."}

The bill preserved the mortgage-interest deduction for second homes, which had been eliminated in the House version. It also left in place a break that lets homeowners shield some of the profits they make selling their homes from capital-gains taxes. \nNow political leaders are turning their attention to remaking mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , a decade after the government-backed entities received federal bailouts. \nBipartisan Senate legislation expected to be introduced early this year is expected to preserve government backing of 30-year mortgages\u2014a critical goal for the NAR\u2014while eventually dialing back federal ownership of the two entities. But the NAR could find itself at odds with some members of Congress who want to see an end to the federal housing guarantees the Realtors consider essential to delivering affordable mortgages to millions of Americans. \nThe tax overhaul marked a significant legislative defeat for the NAR that raises questions about its lobbying strategy and whether it will have more success in the next round. \nIn the fight over the tax bill, the NAR argued that doubling the standard deduction, which eliminates the incentive for most Americans to itemize their tax returns and claim the mortgage-interest deduction, could turn the U.S. into a \u201cnation of renters.\u201d \nIt was a tough sell. Since the housing crash, politicians on both sides of the aisle have been less eager to tout the government\u2019s role in encouraging homeownership. Rising home prices and tighter mortgage credit in recent years, meanwhile, have meant that new loans and purchases have skewed toward the affluent, making government subsidies less politically palatable. \n\u201cAll these flies in the ointment started to add up and it made the [mortgage-interest deduction] quite vulnerable,\u201d said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin, a Seattle-based real-estate brokerage. \nThe NAR\u2019s opposition from the outset, meanwhile, undermined its ability to win compromises, analysts said. \nAfter the president released an outline of the tax overhaul in April, the Realtors called it a \u201cnonstarter,\u201d saying homeowners could see their \u201chome\u2019s value plummet and their equity evaporate.\u201d Online ads in the states of critical swing votes, such as Maine Sen. Susan Collins, described the plan as a \u201ctax increase on middle-class homeowners.\u201d \n\u201cThe Realtors made the decision to do a fairly resolute, if not scorched-earth, resistance to this. \u2026 [They] really got screwed in the House bill because they came out early in opposition,\u201d said Charles Gabriel, president of Capital Alpha Partners, a political forecasting company for investors. \nA turning point came in the lead-up to the house bill when the National Association of Home Builders split from the Realtors for the first time in three decades, proposing a tax credit it said would be better targeted to less wealthy Americans. \nThe builders were convinced the proposal had momentum but received calls from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and Speaker Paul Ryan telling them the Republican leadership didn\u2019t want to complicate the bill with an untested concept like the tax credit, recalled Jerry Howard, chief executive of the NAHB. \nMr. Howard insists that even though the builders group was defeated, it was still the right decision to come to the table because the builders were able to win a number of important concessions for small-business owners and affordable-housing construction. \n\u201cThe Realtors have a very, shall I call it, one-dimensional view of the tax code and that is the mortgage-interest deduction,\u201d Mr. Howard said. \u201cWe have to look at this thing holistically.\u201d \nThe industry split gave lawmakers an opening, but so did fissures in the NAR\u2019s own membership between agents in high-cost states that could see prices decline due to the bill and agents who hope to benefit from a potential exodus to lower-cost ones . A plea for members to call, email or write to members of Congress generated just over 200,000 sign-ups, which amounts to less than a quarter of NAR\u2019s membership. The NAR said that was the largest response in the group\u2019s history. \nAs the Fannie and Freddie debate begins, analysts said the NAR\u2019s power is likely diminished, but it remains a force. \n\u201cThe mortgage industrial complex took it on the chin during the tax debate,\u201d said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading, a Washington, D.C.-based investment bank.

To help investors negotiate the shifting investment landscape we offer our portfolio tips for the coming year:\nNavigating the end of easy money : The last quarter of 2018 will be the first time since the financial crisis when central banks are, in aggregate, withdrawing liquidity from global markets \u2013 the so-called end of easy money. The scale of the withdrawal is small relative to the stimulus, so we don't expect a hit to equity markets. But such policy turning points can see correlations rise in the movements of asset classes like equities and bonds, increasing portfolio volatility. Diversification into less-correlated alternatives, including hedge funds, could help.\nPosition for the return of active management : Market dynamics are starting to favor investors looking to take advantage of specific opportunities. Correlations between S&P 500 stocks recently fell to a 16-year low, meaning that stocks are increasingly being driven by their own fundamentals, rather than by moves in the overall market. The dispersion in valuation between the cheapest and most expensive stocks is also now well above its average since 1991, providing more opportunities for investors or managers seeking value in stocks.\nTurn off the 24 hour news: 2018 will bring more political flux, with March elections in Italy an early focal point. But investors should not get too caught up in the news cycle. In general, we believe that the impact of domestic politics on global markets is overestimated. While politics can have a negative effect on local markets, this can be mitigated by diversification. And the cost of being under invested over the long-term is much greater.\nRide the bumps: Over trading is another risk. Whether returns are positive or negative in the very short-term is largely down to chance. And our own analysis of mutual fund investors' buy and sell decisions indicates those who turned over their portfolios under performed by 0.9 percent annually compared with a buy and hold strategy, between April 2007 and March 2016.\nKeep some insurance: In our base case we don't expect flashpoints on the Korean Peninsula or in the Middle East to escalate to the extent that they disrupt markets. But it's worth holding at least some high-quality bonds in your portfolio, even if expected returns are low (or even negative in some currencies), just in case. They could prove a safe haven and help shield portfolios from losses. Exact percentage holdings will depend on individual investors' requirements, but they shouldn't be tempted to sell all high-quality bonds at this stage in favor of stocks.\nGet on the right side of technology: Tech firms accounted for 23 percent of S&P 500 earnings in the last reporting quarter, up by 5 percentage points in three years, and tech is now the largest sector in the MSCI Emerging Market and MSCI China indices. We see particular opportunities in digital data, automation and robotics, and smart mobility, which should benefit from secular trends such as population growth, aging, and urbanization. Meanwhile, avoiding the sectors at risk of disruption will be key. Recall that the entire US food retail sector fell by more than 10 percent in the week of Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods. The automotive and non-food retail sectors face particular risks.\nAvoid frenzies like cryptocurrencies: Getting on the right side of tech doesn't mean jumping into the latest investment mania. Bitcoin's 1600 percent price gain in 2017 was driven in part by FOMO, the fear of missing out on the next new thing. But it has all the hallmarks of a speculative bubble. Predicting the peak is difficult, but all bubbles tend to result in the same thing \u2013 a transfer of wealth from the many to the very fortunate few who got out at the right time.\nThink about sustainability: There is now strong evidence that incorporating social responsibility as part of the investment decision-making process does not sacrifice returns. Over the past 25 years the returns on the MSCI KLD 400 Social index has performed in line with the S&P 500, while Barclays MSCI Green Bond index has performed in line with the equivalent investment grade bond index since inception in 2013. So those making a New Year's Resolution to make a difference in 2018 can think about doing so with their portfolio, while still aiming for market returns.\nCommentary by Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, overseeing the investment strategy for $2 trillion in invested assets.

Yet despite Amazon\u2019s deep online roots and dominance over Internet shopping, I believe it will buy Target in 2018. \nAfter digging into the realities of both companies, it becomes clear that Amazon buying Target isn\u2019t as bold of a prediction as one might think. Here are three reasons why a merger makes sense. Offline sales will always be a big part of retail \nIt\u2019s no secret that online retail is slowly killing offline. My firm, Loup Ventures, estimates that in the fourth quarter of 2017, about 10% of total U.S. retail sales, or about $125 billion, were online. The longer-term question is: How much of total retail will eventually happen online? Based on our analysis of U.S. retail sales by category (excluding gas and restaurant expenditures), 55% of total retail sales should eventually happen online. \nEven if half of commerce shifts to online, that still leaves a massive market offline at 45%. People in the future will still want to pick up groceries at a local store. As retail changes dramatically going forward, the biggest winners will promote both online and offline opportunities. \nAmazon clearly believes that offline retail is important. In 2017, it acquired 473 Whole Foods locations , opened 13 physical bookstores , and piloted one Amazon Go store, which is an automated convenience store that has no employees or checkout. Acquiring Target would be an extension of this pattern, adding 1,834 stores to bring Amazon\u2019s total retail locations to 2,321. By comparison, Walmart has 5,412 U.S. locations . \nAn Amazon-Target combination would set up a U.S. retail duopoly. On one end, Walmart and Jet.com would focus on the middle- and low-income consumer, controlling about 25% of the market. On the other end, Amazon, Target, and Whole Foods would go after the high-income consumer, controlling about 15% market share. They both pursue affluent consumers \nAmazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods last year confirmed that the online giant\u2019s focus is on the high-income consumer. Market research firm GfK MRI estimates the median household income for an Amazon shopper is $90,100, similar to Whole Foods at $95,200. Target reports its average shopper earns $87,000. These far exceed the U.S. median household income of $55,322. \nBy buying Target, Amazon would solidify its dominance of the high-income consumer. Conversely, if Amazon were to acquire a company targeting lower-income customers, such as Dollar Tree , Amazon would steer its focus away from its core consumers. In my years of observing tech companies, I\u2019ve seen that owning a demographic usually yields the best results. Brick and mortar will get more advanced \nOver the following 10 years, I\u2019d expect Amazon to convert Target and Whole Foods stores to an automated model with few employees. Stores would be monitored by computer vision systems; shelves would be stocked by robots; customers would be helped by service robots that understand natural language; and checkout would resemble Amazon Go locations, where customers simply walk out with their purchases. In this future, the lines between online shopping and automated brick and mortar stores would blur, as cost-focused stores become more like smart warehouses. The few employees working in stores would focus on delivering personalized service based on mutual understanding and empathy, which would enable retailers to differentiate themselves. \nAny number of factors could derail such a combination, including government intervention. But sometimes mergers make too much sense to ignore. Amazon buying Target is one such situation. \nGene Munster is a managing partner at Loup Ventures . He is not an investor of Amazon, Target, or Walmart. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT"}

The funding, made under the EU\u2019s programme for poorer EU regions, was meant for small business and Babis\u2019s Agrofert would not qualify. It was however owned by Agrofert entities earlier and is now owned by Agrofert again. \nBabis has been charged with subsidy fraud in the case but won parliamentary immunity in the election. The lower house is expected to vote on lifting his immunity in the coming weeks. \nThe EU\u2019s OLAF has completed its investigation of the case and sent recommendations to the Czech authorities. The report has not been released so far, with a Czech state attorney saying it could impede investigation. \nIt is up to regional Czech authorities to decide on the European Commission and the Finance Ministry recommendation. Officials there were not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by Robert Muller and Jan Lopatka, Editing by William Maclean)"}

The family of medicines, known as gabapentinoids, includes gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise, Horizant) and pregabalin.\n\u201cNearly one in 25 adults takes a gabapentinoid during a year, which matters because we have little data to support much use of this drug class and minimal data to support the long-term safety of the medications,\u201d said study author Dr. Michael Johansen of the Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine at Ohio University in Athens.\n\u201cMy suspicion is that much of the use is driven by attempting to treat chronic pain with a non-opioid medication,\u201d Johansen said by email.\nU.S. deaths from opioids including heroin and prescription drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone and methadone have more than quadrupled since 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Today, more than six in 10 drug overdose deaths involve opioids.\nAmid this worsening opioid epidemic, the CDC has urged physicians to prescribe other drugs for pain including acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as well as gabapentinoids.\nGabapentin and pregabalin both have won U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for treating partial seizures and a type of nerve pain caused by shingles. A version of gabapentin has also been approved for restless leg syndrome, and pregabalin has additional approvals for fibromyalgia and nerve pain related to diabetes and spinal cord injuries.\nWhile the FDA doesn\u2019t allow drug companies to promote these medicines for other conditions, doctors are free to prescribe the drugs for off-label, or unapproved, uses.\nOff-label use of gabapentinoids has been controversial, however, because these drugs can be addictive, they haven\u2019t been proven effective for many common unapproved uses and there\u2019s limited long-term safety data, Johansen writes in JAMA Internal Medicine.\nFor his study, Johansen reviewed survey data from a nationally representative sample of 346,177 adults, including details on any medical conditions and prescriptions.\nOverall, more than four out of five of prescriptions for gabapentinoids were for gabapentin, the analysis found.\nPrescription growth was concentrated among older adults, diabetics, people with multiple chronic health problems and patients already taking opioids or benzodiazepines like Valium and Xanax.\nOne limitation of the study is that it relied on participants to accurately report on any drug use, and it\u2019s possible that some people did not disclose opioid use. The study didn\u2019t include prescription records or information on drug costs.\n\u201cThe use of gabapentinoids specifically seems to be outpacing any proven efficacy and the potential significant harms like addiction and overdose are only beginning to be investigated,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Goodman, a researcher at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine in Columbia who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\nWhile some patients may benefit from these drugs, they should consider other approaches to pain management like exercise, physical therapy and yoga that may be safer and still provide some relief, Goodman said by email.\nSide effects of gabapentinoids include sedation, dizziness and trouble thinking, Dr. Chad Brummett, an opioid researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. The risks are worse at higher doses.\nMixing these drugs with opioids and benzodiazapines may make them even more dangerous, said Marissa Seamans, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\u201cGabapentinoids are increasingly prescribed to patients with opioids and benzodiazapines, which increases the risk of respiratory depression and death,\u201d Seamans said by email. \u201cClinicians and patients need to carefully monitor the dosage of these medicines, their interactions, and potentially fatal side effects.\u201d\nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2Ar8g2m JAMA Internal Medicine, online January 2, 2018.\n "}

All that time it was at the back of my head, who is going to be coming into the room? You could be asleep and just get attacked.\u201d \nIntersex people are born with sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of male or female bodies. Up to 1.7 percent of people are born with intersex traits, according to the United Nations. \nSami, who asked to use a pseudonym, is one of the more than 3,500 people who claimed asylum in Britain based on their sexuality, gender identity or intersex status between 2015 and 2017, according to the Home Office (interior ministry). \nSami faced threats and discrimination in El Salvador, a conservative Catholic country where gay sex is not illegal but lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTi) people endure harassment and violence. \nThey face rocketing levels of violence from criminal gangs and members of the security forces, rights group Amnesty International said last November. \nIn more than 70 countries being LGBTi is not safe, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), a federation of national and local organisations dedicated to achieving equal rights LGBTi people. \nEven though Britain is more tolerant, LGBTi asylum seekers still face discrimination, threats and even violent attacks, said Sebastian Rocca, chief executive of Micro Rainbow International (MRI), a charity working to eliminate discrimination and poverty among LGBTi people. \n\u201cOne of the problems that LGBTi asylum seekers and refugees face is that because of their sexuality they are extremely isolated and vulnerable,\u201d Rocca said. \nLack of safe housing is a widespread problem as they are often placed in housing with people from their own countries, or with those who are anti-gay because of their religious and cultural backgrounds. \n\u201cThe majority of LGTBi asylum seekers do face some violence or abuse, whether that\u2019s physical, sexual or psychological abuse,\u201d Rocca told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \nSuch abuse reawakens previous traumas. MRI\u2019s clients have reported experiencing the same fears they felt in their home countries, Rocca said. A PLACE TO CALL HOME \nMRI set up Britain\u2019s first safe house for LGBTi refugees and asylum seekers last October and has since opened a second one. \nApart from safe accommodation, residents are provided with psychological support, life-coaching and business training. \nSami moved in last autumn and, for the first time in years, feels safe and at home. Malik (35) a gay asylum seeker from Bangladesh who is staying in Micro Rainbow's hostel, poses for a photo outside of London, United Kingdom. December 11, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation \/ Cormac O'Brien \n\u201cThe fear and uncertainty living in these other places was killing me. Now I finally feel safe because I live with people who respect me,\u201d Sami told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in the cozy house on the outskirts of London. \n\u201cI know I can wake up and just do my make-up and be able to fully express myself without having to be afraid that someone is going to attack me or that someone is going to be judging me.\u201d \nMalik, a gay man from Bangladesh, who came to Britain in 2011, agrees. \n\u201cSince I moved into the house, I\u2018m happy. I have found a family,\u201d said Malik, 35, in whose home country gay sex is illegal and many people strongly disapprove. \nLeading LGBT rights activists Xulhaz Mannan and Mahbub Rabbi Tonoy were hacked to death in Bangladesh in April 2016, amid a spate of violent attacks against secular bloggers, academics, gay rights activists and members of religious minorities. \nMalik found out for himself how entrenched anti-gay attitudes are in his country when his mother disowned him and his brothers threatened to kill him. Slideshow (3 Images) \n\u201cLast time I talked to my mum, she told me \u2018you just humiliate me, don\u2019t come back\u2019. And I can\u2019t go back because my brothers are going to kill me,\u201d Malik said, sitting on his bed in a bright, well-furnished room in the safe house. \nMalik said he used to live with heterosexual people in Britain and even though he was never physically attacked, he suffered verbal abuse, especially from other Bangladeshis. \n\u201cThey don\u2019t attack just physically but mentally attack the whole time,\u201d he said. REJECTED \nHome Office data shows an estimated 6 percent of asylum claims made in Britain between July 2015 and March 2017 were based on sexual orientation. Around a quarter of those applications were successful. \nThe nationalities with the highest number of asylum claims where sexual orientation was raised were Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Nigerian. \nThe Home Office said it \u201cremains committed to improving the process for those claiming asylum on this basis\u201d and that it ensures housing provide to LGBTi asylum seekers is safe. \n\u201cHousing providers are contractually required to take account of any particular circumstances and vulnerability of those that they accommodate, including sexual orientation or gender identity,\u201d a Home Office spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \nCampaigners say a lack of protection for LGBTi asylum seekers is a widespread problem in Europe. In Germany, LGBT asylum seekers have complained about intimidating comments made during their asylum interviews. In Ireland, many face threats and from other asylum seekers in accommodation centres. \nRights groups blame the problem on a lack of basic training on LGBTi rights for those making decisions about asylum claims and interpreters. \nMRI, which supports eight asylum seekers and refugees with safe housing, says much more is needed and aims to provide safe housing for more than 150 LGBTi asylum seekers by 2019. \n\u201cThe need in this country is massive. There are hundreds of LGBTi asylum seekers every year who need a safe place to be,\u201d said Rocca.

An independent committee has started voting on whether evidence backs PMI's claims, already striking down a few. These are only recommendations to the FDA, which is not required to follow them. \nMarc Scheineson, a partner at Alston & Bird and a former associate commissioner for legislative affairs of the FDA, said there is \"little to no chance\" the committee will approve PMI's modified-risk tobacco product application because there's not enough data to meet the strict standards.\nHe pointed to Swedish Match presenting a plethora of clinical data for its product, called snus, yet being denied when it went through the same application process. The FDA later approved Swedish Match's premarket tobacco application. \nThat could be the roadmap for PMI, Scheineson said. PMI has also applied for premarket tobacco approval, which would allow iQOS to be sold in the U.S. That procedure doesn't include a public hearing, so he said applying for the modified-risk tobacco product designation gives PMI a chance to publicly make its case to consumers and regulators. \n\"I think that's absolutely what the strategy is here,\" Scheineson said. \"Philip Morris has made the determination that this is good, free publicity. It's covered here in a scientific forum discussing how the new device works and how it's different than e-cigs.\" \nIn an emailed statement, PMI said it appreciates the opportunity to present its scientific evidence package to the committee but cannot comment at this time because the meeting is still proceeding."}

That compares with an increase of $10 billion in November.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected reserves to rise by $6 billion to $3.125 trillion.\nCapital flight had been seen as a major risk for China at the start of 2017, but a combination of tighter capital controls and a faltering dollar helped the yuan stage a strong turnaround, bolstering confidence in the economy.\nThe yuan rose around 6.8 percent against the greenback in 2017, recovering from a 6.5 percent loss in 2016 and reversing three straight years of depreciation.\nFor the full year, China\u2019s FX reserves rose $129.5 billion from $3.011 trillion at the end of 2016. That\u2019s the first annual rise since 2014.\nChina\u2019s foreign exchange regulator said in a statement on its website that it would keep the nation\u2019s forex reserves and international balance of payments \u201cbalanced and stable\u201d in 2018.\nThe country\u2019s reserves dropped by nearly $1 trillion from a peak of $3.99 trillion in June 2014 to $2.998 trillion in January 2017 as it sought to shore up the yuan and reduce potentially destabilizing capital outflows. But reserves have since climbed by $142 billion.\nDespite the improved capital flow picture, China\u2019s State Administration of Foreign Exchange has continued a clampdown on the movements of funds abroad. The regulator announced last month it would cap overseas withdrawals by people using domestic Chinese bank cards starting this year.\nSome major global acquisitions by Chinese firms have also been put on ice by regulators, who fear they are really intended to disguise movements of capital offshore, though Beijing has maintained genuine investments will still be approved.\nChina\u2019s central bank reported net foreign exchange buying for the third consecutive month in November, marking a policy victory for the authorities after a long battle to stabilize the yuan, although analysts say capital flows are likely to remain volatile as the economy slows.\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the yuan to depreciate slightly this year if the dollar firms.\nThe value of gold reserves rose to $76.47 billion at the end of December, from $75.833 billion at the end of November, data on the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s website showed.\nReporting by Josephine Mason, Meng Meng and Cheng Fang; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n "}

Tesla at one point had more than 500,000 potential buyers on the waiting list for the Model 3. In a statement Wednesday, the company thanked those buyers \"who continue to stick by us while patiently waiting for their cars.\"\nTesla says it made significant progress in reducing unspecified production bottlenecks toward the end of the fourth quarter. It now expects to be making 10,000 Model 3s per month at the end of the first quarter and 20,000 Model 3s per month at the end of the second quarter. But the company said it's focusing on quality and plant efficiency, not just meeting volume targets.\nMichelle Krebs, an executive analyst for the car buying site Autotrader.com , said Tesla would have been better served by not announcing such lofty production targets initially.\n\"The Model 3 must be right in terms of quality.

Hungarian drugmaker Richter Chief Executive Gabor Orban speaks during an interview in Budapest, Hungary January 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Gergely Szakacs \nIn December the European Medicines Agency (EMA) opened a review into Esmya, used to treat non-cancerous tumors in the womb, after four reports of serious liver damage in patients treated with the drug, three of whom ended up needing liver transplants. \nRichter has said its clinical data indicated no demonstrable link between liver damage and Esmya, one of its flagship products, which accounted for about 6 percent of revenues in the first nine months of 2017. \n\u201cWe maintain the view that this is an effective and safe method of treatment for a wide population of patients,\u201d Chief Executive Gabor Orban said in an interview on Friday. \nAsked whether the uncertainty, which sparked a sell-off in Richter\u2019s shares early last month, spilled over into sales of the medicine, Orban said it was too early to assess any fallout. \n\u201cSales in the first eleven months (of 2017) were on track\u201d for the drug to reach its full-year revenue target of 85 million euros ($102 million), Orban said. \nOrban said December sales data was generally \u201cdifficult to interpret,\u201d while he had seen no data for January yet. \nRichter shares closed 1 percent higher at 6,735 forints ($26) on the Budapest Stock Exchange on Friday, having underperformed the blue-chip index over the past three months. \nOrban said if current levels of uncertainty around Esmya persist, Richter, which makes gynecological, cardiovascular and central nervous system drugs, may not issue earnings guidance next month, as it usually does. \nThe last time that happened was in 2009, during the global financial crisis, when the company said the market environment was too unpredictable to give reliable forecasts. \n\u201cWe will see what happens with the turnover of Esmya and the level of uncertainty in a month,\u201d Orban said. The EMA has said it would next discuss the issue in February. \nRichter, which has a market capitalization of $4.8 billion and earns most of its revenue from exports, will publish fourth-quarter earnings on February 8. Orban said there were no further cases of liver damage since the inquiry was launched. \nAsked about a worst-case scenario, Orban said as with any medicine, that would be health regulators withdrawing the registration of Esmya, adding that he saw \u201czero sign\u201d of that happening. \u201cThis is entirely unrealistic,\u201d he said. \nOrban added that Richter, whose biggest markets are Russia and the European Union, had nearly 100 billion forints ($390 million) of cash to spend on acquisitions and while there were several possible targets, no deal was imminent. \nThe CEO also said the outcome of the Esmya probe would have no impact on dividend policy.

EasyJet (ejttf) will also seek to beat a target of ensuring that 20% of new pilots are women by 2020, Lundgren said. \nU.K. government data show men out-earn women at every level across industries, with the gap widest in skilled trades, according to figures released this month. EasyJet came under fire after it said there was a 51.7% difference between men and women, driven by the gender imbalance among its pilots, its highest paid position. Only 5% of the carrier\u2019s flight-deck crew are women, though that proportion is higher than the industry average of 4%, it said. \nRead: How Robots Could Make the Gender Pay Gap Even Worse \nLundgren\u2019s most recent full-time position in the travel industry was with German tourism operator TUI AG, which he left in 2015 after the company merged with its U.K. business. Contractually barred from being employed at a rival immediately following that deal, he was a travel consultant until joining EasyJet on Dec. 1. The company said Lundgren asked the board to cut his salary. \u2018Absolutely Committed\u2019 \n\u201cAt EasyJet we are absolutely committed to giving equal pay and equal opportunity for women and men,\u201d Lundgren said in Monday\u2019s statement. \u201cI also want to affirm my own commitment to address the gender imbalance in our pilot community which drives our overall gender pay gap.\u201d\u2019 \nThe U.K. government has mandated that all companies with a workforce exceeding 250 employees publish details of gender pay gaps by April 4. EasyJet was one of the earliest to report, providing figures in November. Other airlines operating in Britain have yet to do so. \nRead: EasyJet Shares Pop as Airline Profits From Other Carriers\u2019 Woes \nIn a report in advance of EasyJet\u2019s annual shareholders meeting next month, the advisory group ISS only gives the company \u201cqualified support\u201d for its remuneration report. ISS pointed out that the new CEO was appointed on a higher salary than his predecessors and that the amount is \u201cnot without concern for shareholders.\u201d With McCall\u2019s departure, only two of the airline\u2019s eight board members are women. \nWhile Lundgren has lowered his base salary, a bigger proportion of EasyJet\u2019s CEO compensation is paid through bonuses and incentive targets. The carrier said last year that it was relaxing executive pay goals after McCall\u2019s total remuneration fell to 1.5 million pounds in fiscal 2016 from 6.2 million pounds a year earlier.

REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst\/Files That view emerged in recent interviews with four central bankers across the policy spectrum, from those eager to keep interest rates low, to those more inclined to raise rates as a guard against asset bubbles or any unexpected inflation jolt.\nThe interviews offer the most detailed look yet at a key issue -- whether the changes in the tax code might prompt the Fed to raise rates more quickly and thus blunt the new law\u2019s impact. The issue has divided analysts, with even staff at Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation assuming an \u201caggressive\u201d Fed reaction to the new law.\nBut all four of those interviewed by Reuters shared a common conclusion that the law would provide some short-term benefit without raising any near-term risks.\nThey predict that the combination of corporate and household tax cuts will raise growth by up to half a percentage point annually for the next couple of years, and help keep unemployment at near record lows and thus perhaps raise wages.\nIn addition, depending on how companies respond in terms of increased investment, the plan might raise long-run potential growth by a small amount.\nWhat they do not see is any great risk that the tax stimulus will fuel inflation or a run-up in asset prices that would prompt the Fed to raise interest rates any faster than it already plans. Though not an endorsement of the legislation, it is an important sign the Fed will not stand in its way.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel any urgency to do something preemptively,\u201d Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said in an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the American Economic Association annual conference in Philadelphia.\nMester has been among those more inclined to lift rates from crisis-era levels, but sees no reason to rush because of the tax overhaul, which she predicts will raise annual growth as much as a half a percentage point for the next few years.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent economic projections forecast three interest rate rises in 2018. Market pricing currently indicates two.\nSome private-sector economists recently penciled in four rises, partly because of the tax plan\u2019s impact and how it might affect the Fed.\nCentral bankers, however, seem poised to stick with their current plans, confident that inflation will stay tame and that the recent record run on U.S. stock markets is largely the result of economic fundamentals, not dangerous speculation.\nThe view is not universal, with some officials cautioning that the corporate tax cut in particular may be funneled into share buybacks or other financial maneuvers that could drive asset prices to unreasonable levels. The increase in the deficit is also a long-term concern.\nBut the overall wait-and-see stance was implicit in the policy statement and economic projections the Fed issued in December after it raised its target interest rate.\nThe U.S. Capitol building is lit at dusk ahead of planned votes on tax reform in Washington, U.S., December 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Joshua Roberts\/Files Policymakers upped their forecast for economic growth at the time but held steady their expectation on rate rises.\nNEW FED CHAIR The tax cuts will kick in just as the Federal Reserve transitions to a new leadership, with former banker Jerome Powell taking over from Janet Yellen, who over four years as Fed chair focused on lowering the jobless rate in hopes of healing household finances after the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.\nWith the fiscal stimulus, some policymakers say the unemployment rate could now drop as low as 3.5 percent next year, in what World Bank Chief Economist Paul Romer said amounts to an important \u201cexperiment\u201d in determining just how low unemployment can go in a post-crisis, low-inflation world.\n\u201cThe balance of risks right now suggests that it would be a good idea to experiment with pushing employment a lot harder,\u201d Romer said in Philadelphia.\nThe unemployment rate is currently 4.1 percent, well below the 4.5 percent to 5 percent level that standard economic models say should lead to higher inflation. But so far, inflation remains tame.\n\u201cWe keep our powder dry,\u201d said Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, who, far from accelerating the pace of rate hikes, on Friday indicated he was ready to slow them down because wage growth remained weak.\nCONSUMER PULL OR INVESTMENT PUSH The tax cuts are split between a deep reduction to 21 percent on corporate profits, changes in the personal income tax that will shave what many households pay, and an increase in the value of the child tax credit, among other changes.\nHow that affects the economy will depend on the degree to which it fuels consumption by putting more money in people\u2019s pockets, versus \u201csupply side\u201d changes that could cause companies to invest more as a result of the lower tax rates.\nPolicymakers like St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and John Williams of the San Francisco Fed said in interviews those changes would raise short-term growth and could possibly raise longer-term potential - though not by as much as the Trump administration expects.\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing it in an environment where you have very low inflation already so you probably don\u2019t have to worry as much about the monetary policy push-back that you would get in some other environments,\u201d Williams told Reuters.\nBullard noted the tax cut \u201cis actually not that big in the big scheme,\u201d parceling out to about $150 billion a year in a more than $18 trillion economy.\nThe more important effect, he said, may only become apparent over the long term if it does in fact raise potential, or \u201ctrend,\u201d growth. If that happens by increasing productivity, for example, and compounding over time, \u201ceven a couple tenths means a lot,\u201d he said.\nReporting by Howard Schneider and Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n "}

FILE PHOTO - South Korean President Moon Jae-In sits next to Chinese President Xi Jinping (not seen) during a signing ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China December 14, 2017.

Japan said any attempt to revise it could damage relations. \nEight of the women met Moon for lunch at the presidential compound, known as the Blue House, in Seoul, the president\u2019s office said in a statement. \n\u201cWe told you the previous government\u2019s agreement was wrong and this issue hasn\u2019t been resolved,\u201d Moon told one of the women before the lunch. \n\u201cIt\u2019s still not an easy situation to handle within our bilateral relationship.\u201d \nMoon wanted to gauge the women\u2019s reaction to his government\u2019s position on the deal, the Blue House said. \nMoon visited one of the women, Kim Bok-dong, separately in the morning as she was ill and unable to attend the lunch. \n\u201cWe survived when bullets were raining down and we\u2019ll be able to get through this,\u201d Kim told Moon, the Blue House said. \nThe women want Japan to take legal, binding responsibility for its actions and Kim was scornful of the 2015 pay-out. \n\u201cThe money should be sent back to Japan,\u201d she said. \nSouth Korean activists estimate that there may have been as many as 200,000 Korean women forced to work in the brothels. \nAs of December, there are at least 32 surviving, according to a South Korean civic group set up to look after their rights. \nIt was the second time former \u201ccomfort women\u201d visited the Blue House during Moon\u2019s presidency after one was invited to a dinner when U.S. President Donald Trump visited in November. \nMoon\u2019s announcement on the Japanese deal last week raised consternation in Japan, where media reported said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may decide not to visit South Korea for the Winter Olympics there next month. \nSouth Korea\u2019s foreign ministry said on Thursday it would seek final measures on the issue as quickly as possible while one ministry official told Reuters the measures could be finalised as early as next week. \nStrained ties come as the U.S. allies are trying to cooperate on security in the face of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile development. \nBut their bitter history, including Japanese colonisation of the Korean peninsula and the issue of the women, has regularly been a source of rancour between them. \nMoon came to power in May after the removal of his disgraced predecessor, Park Geun-hye, whose conservative government was criticised for failing to fully consult victims over the 2015 settlement.

Rates The informal start to earnings season was led by the big banks, almost all of which issued their reports this week. Cramer noticed that in their conference calls, top executives touted how much money they can make when both short- and long-term interest rates are climbing .\n\"Makes sense \u2014 when rates go up, lending becomes more profitable for the banks,\" Cramer said. \"But just as we finally start to get some inflection in the yield curve, suddenly all kinds of commentators are bemoaning the potential consequences of higher long-term rates on the U.S. economy. How the heck is that possible?\"\nJust a few months ago, many of the same commentators were raising concerns about a flattening yield curve, the \"Mad Money\" host said. Now, they're insisting it's not flat enough.\n\"I'd say these so-called experts need to read the conference calls, but I suspect it wouldn't matter. Why the heck would you ever let the facts get in the way of a good negative story?\" he quipped.\n2. Trump President Donald Trump has easily become one of the country's, if not the world's, most controversial figures.\nThere are few places where that plays out more starkly than in the market. Trump supporters credit the president for a strong economy and surging stock market ; those who dislike him refuse to acknowledge the tangible effects of tax cuts and deregulation.\n\"That's a bad way to approach investing,\" Cramer said. \"You need to put aside your personal opinions. Even if you loathe Trump, even if you think he's an idiot, even if you view trickle-down economics as a toxic ideology, listen up: you have to be able to admit that his agenda has been very good for business and for your stocks.\"\n3. Cryptocurrencies Investors are head over heels for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin even though many of them are undergoing major, volatile swings in price , the \"Mad Money\" host said.\nAt the same time, they're ignoring stabler equities like stocks.\n\"If the cryptos keep crashing, that speculative money will have to go somewhere,\" Cramer said. \"I bet it will flood into stocks, mostly micro- and mini-capitalization companies that have about as much going for them as bitcoin. It will give those tiny stocks a huge boost, but [it's] not happening yet.\"\n4. Stocks Finally, Cramer sees dissonance in the overall market when it comes to individual stocks.\nA lack of initial public offerings (IPOs) and secondary offerings combined with increased share buybacks is reducing the amount of stock on the market, but exchange-traded funds continue to buy big swaths of stock all the same, he said.\nThat means that as stock-pickers seek to buy individual stocks, buyers from ETFs, index funds, hedge funds and other deep-pocketed institutions continually push prices higher, thus lowering the value for companies that don't consistently buy back their shares.\nFinal thoughts \"Put it all together and you can understand why this market has faced so much skepticism, pessimism, whatever you want to call it, cynicism, even as it keeps powering higher,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"Gradually, the bears will be forced to acknowledge reality, and when they do, that's how you get another leg of upside.\"\nWATCH: Cramer finds 'cognitive dissonance' in the market show chapters Cramer tracks 4 growing market discrepancies: Rates, Trump, cryptocurrencies and stocks 20 Hours Ago | 07:55 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

{"published":"2018-01-17T23:33:00.000+02:00","title":"Steve Ballmer deserves his due as a great CEO","text":"Microsoft shares just broke the $90 barrier for the first time. The company now has a market capitalization around $700 billion.\nInvestors and the press have been quick to praise CEO Satya Nadella. And he deserves it. Nadella has abandoned Microsoft's ill-timed smartphone foray, stepped on the gas in cloud, and helped refresh the company culture.\nOn the day he was appointed CEO on February 4, 2014, the Microsoft stock price was around $36. It's almost tripled since.\nI'm not surprised Nadella has done well. I predicted in August 2013, right after Steve Ballmer announced his plans to step down, that the Microsoft board would pick him as the next CEO because of the solid job he'd done leading the company's cloud and server businesses. He deserves enormous credit for his strong leadership in the past 4 years.\nBut Steve Ballmer deserves to remembered as a great Microsoft CEO who laid many of the seeds which have allowed the company's stock to explode since he left.\nBallmer is remembered as a big sweaty clownish figure because of videos like this . He's remembered as a buffoon for laughing at the iPhone in 2007 . He's remembered for overpaying for acquisitions like aQuantive for $6 billion and trying to buy Yahoo for $44 billion (which, it turns out, would have netted some pretty attractive investment stakes).\nPerhaps what irked investors the most about Ballmer is that the stock hardly moved under his watch. A week before he was named Bill Gates' successor in January 2000, Microsoft's stock hit an all-time high of $58 in the midst of the dot com craze. A year later, the stock was $21. When Ballmer agreed to step down as CEO in August 2013 at the urging of activist investor ValueAct and the rest of the Microsoft board, it was $32.\nTherefore, over his 13-year tenure, the stock dropped, was flat, or slightly up -- depending on where you measure from. Investors complained Microsoft didn't keep up with the gains of its peers.\nThe day Ballmer said he'd leave Microsoft in 2013, the company's market cap was $245 billion. It's now $700 billion. That doesn't happen simply because a new CEO is more charismatic. A lot of these gains in market cap are because of Ballmer's stewardship.\nHe was a bridge between the old Microsoft, which was focused on desktop PC software, and the new Microsoft. There'd be no Microsoft Azure cloud or Office 365 without Ballmer's decision to invest in the cloud. The payback wasn't immediately obvious: Amazon Web Services hadn't yet shown up in a positive way on Amazon 's financials, and other cloud-based software businesses like Salesforce were criticized for their lack of profits.\nSo these bets looked like signing up for a lifetime of negative gross margins for many investors. Investors gnashed their teeth at the prospect of customers no longer profitably buying Microsoft software on CDs.\nYet, Ballmer stayed the course. Nadella would not be the CEO of Microsoft today if Ballmer had not given him the resources he needed to lead the cloud group prior to his getting the top job.\nBack in October 2007, Ballmer green-lit a $240 million investment in Facebook at a $15 billion valuation. Critics assailed it as a preposterously high valuation for a three-and-a-half year old company and yet another sign that Ballmer was spending recklessly like a drunken sailor. Although Microsoft later sold its stake and is no longer listed as a shareholder by FactSet, the bet was a great one: Facebook is now worth over $500 billion.\nThe activist hedge fund ValueAct reportedly pushed for Ballmer's ouster. They had a $2 billion stake in Microsoft in early 2013 which helped get them a board seat. Five years later, their representative on the Microsoft board, Morfit Mason, decided not to seek re-election in 2017. ValueAct will be able to sell its remaining stake worth $800 million on the open market. That stake would have been worth around $270 million back in 2013. That means ValueAct has already sold 87% of its original $2 billion stake earlier at lower prices along the way.\nOver this same time, Ballmer has said he's sold none of his 330 million shares. That means his $10 billion stake in Microsoft is worth about $30 billion today.\nOh, and Ballmer bought the LA Clippers basketball team in between for $2 billion, which critics howled was a dramatic overpay by Ballmer. In the last few months, two other NBA teams -- the Houston Rockets and Brooklyn Nets -- have traded for well over $2 billion.\nWe have all had hits and misses in our investment and management careers. Warren Buffett famously said he only needed to be right 51% of the time to be considered a great investor.\nAnd Ballmer had his sins. He was too slow in mobile. He tried to match and surpass Google with Bing and that didn't work out. He bought Nokia's handset division right before he left and Nadella quickly reversed course later.\nBut Ballmer made a lot of money for shareholders, he never had to overpay for patents because he acquired them all along, and he pointed the company in the directions which have allowed it to become a $700 billion business today.\nHe still gets maligned as an enthusiastic dunce. He should be properly remembered for setting the company on its current trajectory.\nAnd when was the last time you met a dunce who, according to Bloomberg, is currently worth $35.9 billion?\nshow chapters Steve Ballmer shares his winning philosophy on business and investing 12:07 PM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 | 16:21"}

As Trump approaches the end of his first 12 months in office, the jobs and stock markets have given the president solid gains to cheer about.\nThe economy has added roughly 1.8 million net new jobs since last December, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. And with equities hitting new highs, the stock market has risen some 20 percent since he took office, as measured by the S&P 500 index .\nBut compared with other U.S. presidents, stock market gains during Trump's first year, while solid, aren't the biggest advances under the previous 12 occupants of the Oval Office.\n\nPresidents Harry Truman and Barack Obama scored the biggest first-year stock market gains, largely because they came into office following deep sell-offs. The stock market posted the biggest losses during the first years of Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush.\nStock investors have cheered some of the dramatic changes in policies brought by the Trump administration \u2014 from deep tax cuts for corporations to an easing of regulations on both large and small businesses.\n\nBut over the longer term, stock market performance under past presidents also has been driven by forces beyond the control of the White House, including periodic recessions. With the start of the last recession now more than a decade in the rearview mirror, investors seem unconcerned about the prospect of another one on the horizon.\n\nThe same holds true when it comes to job creation.\nTrump's first-year record is solidly in the middle of the pack compared with past presidents, as the overall level of U.S. payrolls are up some 1.3 percent since Trump took office. (The percentage gain is a fairer measure than total jobs created because Trump is presiding over a labor market that is much larger than it was decades ago.)\n\nThose first-year jobs records have been based largely on economic cycles, with payroll gains and losses tied closely to the arrival of recessions.\nAs long as the economy continues to dodge the next recession, Trump's jobs record will continue to compare favorably with his predecessors.\nWATCH: Where the jobs are: Trump's first year show chapters Where the jobs are: Trump's first year impact      8 Hours Ago | 01:49"}

Since I started with sport, the Olympics has been the big one,\u201d Samuelsson said. \n\u201cI\u2019ve watched it on TV, it\u2019s the big highlight for every athlete, and to experience that would be incredible.\u201d \nSamuelsson started out as a cross-country skier before his head was turned while watching a biathlon competition in his home town of Solleftea, and soon after he was learning how to shoot with an air rifle. \n\u201cIt\u2019s very technical, especially in the prone position as you have to lie in the same way every time to make sure the shots go to the same place,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt gets harder and harder the more pressure is on - all of a sudden if you\u2019re shooting for a medal in the Olympics or a good place in the World Cup, it\u2019s easy for your thoughts to run away and to get nervous. That makes it a lot harder,\u201d he said. \nSamuelsson is well aware of his relative lack of comparative experience, and said he hopes to learn from the Olympics. \n\u201dIn some way, you want your best result for the season to be at the Olympics, to have a little better form, shoot well - it\u2019s more about precision, to arrive there and have a good race and shoot well. \n\u201cThen whatever place you get, that\u2019s hard to say, but top 10 in the Olympics would be a dream. Top-20 would be good too, I\u2018m still a junior, I\u2019ll be at the Olympics to see and learn.\u201d \nSamuelsson and his team mates know that competition will be stiff in South Korea. \n\u201cThe IBU has invested in broadening the sport, even in smaller nations,\u201d he said. \n\u201dIn cross-country skiing, there are very few nations who have a chance, but in the men\u2019s class in biathlon, there\u2019s probably 30 athletes who could win a medal if they have a good day. \n\u201cThen you have the likes of Martin Fourcade of France, clearly those guys are a step ahead in some ways, so you can\u2019t make a mistake with the shooting.\u201d \nSamuelsson may be going to the Olympics to learn, but he believes that he and his fellow Swedes have a good shot at a medal. \n\u201cIn particular in the relay, I think Sweden have a really good chance,\u201d he said.

Zarrab pleaded guilty and testified for the prosecutors. \nIn several days on the witness stand, Zarrab had described a sprawling scheme that he said included bribes to Turkish government officials and was carried out with the blessing of current President Tayyip Erdogan. \nHalkbank had no immediate comment. Attempts to reach Erdogan\u2019s spokesman for comment on the allegations at the trial have been unsuccessful. Erdogan has publicly dismissed the case as a politically motivated attack on his government. \nIn brief public remarks after the verdict was announced, Erdogan made no comment on the trial but a senior Turkish government official rejected the verdict. \nU.S. prosecutors have criminally charged nine people, though only Zarrab, 34, and Atilla, 47, have been arrested by U.S. authorities. \nBANKERS\u2019 CHOICE \n\u201cForeign banks and bankers have a choice: you can choose wilfully to help Iran and other sanctioned nations evade U.S. law, or you can choose to be part of the international banking community transacting in U.S. dollars,\u201d Joon Kim, the acting U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement after the verdict was read. \u201cBut you can\u2019t do both.\u201d \nU.S. District Judge Richard Berman scheduled Atilla to be sentenced on April 11. \nVictor Rocco, one of Atilla\u2019s lawyers, told reporters that the banker would ask Berman to overturn the verdict and would appeal if necessary. \n\u201cWe believe he\u2019s innocent,\u201d Rocco said. \u201cWe intend, and he intends, most importantly, to continue to fight and clear his name.\u201d \nThe trial carried echoes of an investigation in Turkey in 2012 and 2013 that involved Zarrab and multiple government officials. One of the prosecutors\u2019 witnesses was a former Turkish police officer, Huseyin Korkmaz, who said he led that investigation. \nKorkmaz said he was jailed in retaliation, and eventually fled to the United States, carrying evidence from his investigation with him. \nA senior government official in Turkey said Wednesday\u2019s verdict was \u201cvoid.\u201d \n\u201cWe consider this verdict void in every sense; international law has been violated,\u201d said the official, who declined to be named. \u201cIt cannot have a negative impact on the Turkish economy, banking system or Halkbank, specifically.\u201d \nLast month, Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul demanded in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions that Korkmaz be returned to Turkey, calling him \u201ca fugitive, a terror suspect facing serious allegations.\u201d \nThe Turkish government has said that followers of the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen were behind both the Turkish investigation and the U.S. case, as well as the 2016 failed coup in Turkey.

But any loosening of the restrictions on weapons sales would be in defiance of human rights and arms control advocates who said there was too great a risk of fueling violence in regions such as the Middle East and South Asia or arms being diverted to be used in terrorist attacks.\nBesides greater use of a network of military and commercial attaches already stationed at U.S. embassies in foreign capitals, senior officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said another thrust of the plan will be to set in motion a realignment of the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR). It is a central policy governing arms exports since 1976 and has not been fully revamped in more than three decades.\nThis expanded government effort on behalf of American arms makers, together with looser restrictions on weapons exports and more favorable treatment of sales to non-NATO allies and partners, could bring additional billions of dollars in deals and more jobs, a senior U.S. official said, without providing specifics.\nThe strategy of having the Pentagon and the U.S. State Department take a more active role in securing foreign arms deals could especially benefit major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co.\n\"We want to see those guys, the commercial and military attaches, unfettered to be salesmen for this stuff, to be promoters,\" said the senior administration official, who is close to the internal deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nA State Department official, asked to confirm details of the coming new policy, said the revamped approach \"gives our partners a greater capacity to help share the burden of international security, benefits the defense industrial base and will provide more good jobs for American workers.\"\nThe White House and Pentagon declined official comment.\nDefense industry officials and lobbyists have privately welcomed what they expect will be a more sales-friendly approach.\nIt is unclear how deeply the diplomats and military officers overseas will delve into dealmaking and what guidelines will be established, said officials in the administration.\nTrump, a Republican, has the legal authority to direct government embassy \"security assistance officers,\" both military personnel and civilians, to do more to help drive arms sales.\nAdministration officials see this group, which already has duties such as managing military aid overseas and providing information to foreign governments for buying U.S. arms, as underutilized by previous presidents.\nGraphic on U.S. arms sales: http:\/\/tmsnrt.rs\/2CZkZMB\n'BACK SEAT' FOR HUMAN RIGHTS?\nOne national security analyst said that easing export restrictions to allow defense contractors to reap greater profits internationally would increase the danger of top-of-the-line U.S. weapons going to governments with poor human rights records or being used by militants.\n\"This administration has demonstrated from the very beginning that human rights have taken a back seat to economic concerns,\" said Rachel Stohl, director of the conventional defense program at the Stimson Center in Washington. \"And the short-sightedness of a new arms export policy could have serious long-term implications.\"\nThe administration officials said human rights considerations would remain part of the formula for arms sales decisions. But they said such reviews would now afford greater weight than before to whether a deal would be good for the U.S. economy and strengthen America's defense industrial base, in which case red tape would be cut accordingly.\nRules to make it easier to sell U.S.-made military drones overseas and compete against fast-growing Chinese and Israeli rivals are also expected to be in the Trump plan, officials said.\nTrump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also sought to make it easier to sell to America's most trusted allies but in a more cautious approach that his administration billed as a way to boost American business while keeping strict controls against more dangerous arms proliferation. Foreign weapons sales soared during his tenure, with the United States retaining its position as the world's top arms supplier.\nShares of the five biggest U.S. defense contractors, including Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon Co, General Dynamics Corp and Northrop Grumman have more than tripled over the last five years and currently trade at or near all-time highs.\nForeign military sales in fiscal 2017, comprising much of Trump's first year in office and the final months of Obama's term, climbed to $42 billion, compared to $31 billion in the prior year, according to the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency.\nThe Trump administration has already moved forward on several controversial sales. Those include a push for $7 billion in precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia despite concerns they have contributed to civilian deaths in the Saudi campaign in Yemen's civil war and the unblocking of $3 billion in arms to Bahrain, which was also held up by human rights concerns under Obama.\nSimilar concerns have been raised over the administration's preparations to make it easier for American gun makers to sell small arms, including assault rifles and ammunition, to foreign buyers.\nA draft of the new policy proposals recently finished by inter-agency teams coordinated by Trump's National Security Council must now be approved by a select group of senior cabinet members before being sent to his desk, the government sources said.\nOnce Trump announces an extensive framework of the plan, there will be a 60-day public comment period. After that, the administration is expected to unveil further details. Some of the changes are expected to take the form of what is formally known as a presidential \"National Security Decision Directive,\" two of the sources said.\n(Reporting by Mike Stone and Matt Spetalnick in Washington; Editing by Chris Sanders and Grant McCool)"}

As several Senate Democrats and even some Republicans said they would oppose another stopgap spending plan, third-ranking GOP Sen. John Thune said he was \"concerned\" the bill would not have 60 votes to pass the Senate, according to Politico .\nThe outlet and NBC News also reported that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was preparing to keep the chamber in session all weekend in the event a shutdown happens, with the intention of forcing Democrats from states that backed Trump into politically perilous votes. Some of those Democrats, like Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, face tough re-election bids this year. \nGetty Images Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) answers questions on the possibility of a government shutdown at the U.S. Capitol on January 18, 2018 in Washington, DC. Ryan, like Trump and McConnell, put the burden on Senate Democrats to back the proposal \u2014 which would extend government funding to Feb. 16 and reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program for six years \u2014 and avert a government shutdown. Republicans control the House, Senate and White House, and the House can pass a spending plan with only GOP votes. \nWhile Ryan projected confidence, he faces some resistance within his own membership. Mark Meadows, leader of the conservative Freedom Caucus, told media outlets that the group is largely opposed to the continuing resolution.\nSherman tweet \nThe GOP may have to go it alone in the House. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said \"we'll be opposing\" the continuing resolution, which she called a \"bad idea\" and \"wrong.\" She added that majority Republicans will \"own\" a shutdown. \nThe Senate, meanwhile, will need support from nine Democrats, if all Republicans back the legislation. Virginia Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, among others, announced their opposition to the bill.\n\"If the Senate Democrats want to shut the government down, if the Senate Democrats want to deny funding for our troops, if the Senate Democrats want to stop funding CHIP for unrelated issues \u2014 that's a choice they would make, I don't think it's a good choice for them to make \u2014 but that would be their decision to make,\" Ryan told reporters on Thursday. \nMeanwhile, Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Rounds of South Dakota also said they would oppose the funding bill as crafted by the House. \nDemocrats have threatened to oppose the plan if they cannot also pass a bill this week protecting hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which President Donald Trump ended in September, will start to phase out on March 5. \nShortly before Ryan spoke, Trump said a shutdown \"could happen\" and also said \"it's up to the Democrats\" to avoid it. \nEarlier, Trump's tweet about CHIP added more confusion to the already contentious scramble to keep the government funded. Trump said \"CHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension!\"\nLater Thursday, a White House spokesman clarified Trump's position: \"The President supports the continuing resolution introduced in the House. Congress needs to do its job and provide full funding of our troops and military with a two year budget caps deal. However, as the deal is negotiated, the President wants to ensure our military and national security are funded. He will not let it be held hostage by Democrats.\" \nRyan on Thursday said Trump's tweet is \"not causing us problems at all.\" He added that Trump understands how CHIP works. \nWhile Republicans have looked to pin the blame on Democrats for a possible shutdown, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday that a shutdown \"will fall squarely on the majority leader's shoulders and the president's shoulders.\"\nNegotiations on an immigration bill that would protect immigrants shielded by DACA and meet Republican demands to boost border security and tweak extended family migration and the visa \"lottery\" system hit a snag last week when Trump rejected a deal reached by bipartisan senators."}

A number of winter coats at Moncler , Canada Goose and Mackage are already sold out on their websites and in some department stores. Same can be said for long underwear.\nThe storm, and its subsequent deep freeze, come at a precarious time for retailers.\n\"Retailers are exhaling because they just made it through the big holiday season. Many will be light on inventory, people are catching up from vacations, they're focusing on returns,\" said Frank Layo, managing director at Kurt Salmon, part of Accenture Strategy.\n\"It's not a great time for retailers to have a storm.\"\nRetailers and brands are coming off a strong holiday season, but they still have things they need to prove .\nAnd while the holiday shopping season has long been the most crucial for retailers, sales now extend beyond the holidays, and so do the importance of the weeks that follow. If shoppers look for a scarf, gloves or hat that sold out during the holiday rush, that doesn't so much denote a victory for the retailer as it does a lost sale.\n\"If I sold out of an item, it means I've missed a sale, and you're going to buy it elsewhere. That is never a good thing for a retailer,\" said Mikey Vu, a partner in Bain's retail practice.\nJust two or three out of stocks can drive a shopper to defect to another retailer for the long haul, Vu said.\nThe challenges for retailers to stay in stock are the same for brick and mortar as they are online. Retailers need to make sure they have the right amount of inventory sitting in either their online warehouses or in their stores. Simply moving one item to another location is costly, let alone difficult in the snow.\n\"The most important thing about the supply chain is predictability and consistency,\" said Bain's Vu. \"Anything that disrupts that can be painful. \"Weather impacts retailers in a huge way.\"\nWarehouse space, meanwhile, is precious and expensive. No retailer wants an unwanted scarf taking up warehouse space in July. Retailers have in recent years bought less inventory in hopes of staving off unused excess and fire sale discounts.\nCanada Goose said its sell-outs are part of its strategy. Demand outstripping supply wards off department store discounts. It also told CNBC it sells out of coats regardless of weather.\n\"We actively build customer demand ahead of supply to avoid the promotional activity that is common to the apparel industry, allowing us and our wholesale partners to sell our products at full price,\" said Dani Reiss, president and CEO of Canada Goose .\nMeantime, executives have also worked aggressively to improve their supply chains and inventory management as shoppers become more demanding. Fast fashion has trained consumers to expect new styles at a frequent turnover, and to shop the week, not the season.\nSome of these changes have hinged on using data and advanced analytics to better predict weather and shopping patterns. Retailers have looked to automate their distribution centers, making the turnaround from warehouse to store faster. They've also sought to expedite their suppliers' work itself, expecting them to produce and deliver faster.\nThis means you may have an easier time finding gloves in January, but don't count on it. It's a delicate balance as the retailers try to maximize profits.\n\"After many retailers did a stellar job of fast delivery over Christmas, it's unfortunate that a storm has the potential to undo customer goodwill,\" said Accenture's Layo."}

In sum, Moon's action \"creates serious problems for the U.S. security architecture in northeast Asia,\" he added.\nNagy, on the other hand, doesn't expect Beijing will support tensions between Moon and Abe.\nChina will be wary of South Korean efforts to alienate Japan as it could push Tokyo closer to the White House, he said.

Instead, publisher Henry Holt & Co. bumped up the book's publication date up four days from Jan. 9 to Jan. 5, citing \"unprecedented demand.\"\nCourtenay Brown | CNBC Michael Wolff Friday, the book held the No. 1 spot top on Amazon's best-sellers list in books.\n\"There has been increased interest in this title over the last 72 hours, with the book sitting on the top of our Best Sellers lists for Books, Kindle Books, and Audible,\" a representative from Amazon tells CNBC Make It Friday.\nHere's a look at how best-sellers lists for books really work.\nAmazon The rankings for Amazon are calculated roughly every hour from data on book sales, but the factors considered by the e-commerce giant's algorithms remain largely a mystery.\n\"It is like the most closely guarded secret in the universe,\" Ellen Geiger, vice president and senior agent at Frances Goldin Literary Agency , tells CNBC Make It.\nWhile it isn't clear exactly how many copies of a book must be sold to break into a slot on the list, a 2013 study of Amazon's best-sellers list for a two-week period by Publishers Weekly found that \"a title in Amazon's top five averages 1,094 print copies sold across all channels, including other retailers, on a typical day.\"\nSince Amazon updates its rankings so frequently, \"really what it measures is velocity of sales ... over a short period of time rather than an absolute number of sales over a longer period,\" says Caroline Eisenmann, an associate agent at Frances Goldin. \"What it reflects is how a book is selling relative to the other books on Amazon during any one time.\"\nStill, that No. 1 slot in books is certainly an indication of a buying spike.\n\"If a book has cracked the top 100 and and particularly the top 20 and stays there \u2014 the duration is a huge part of it, if it stays there for a few days \u2014 that is generally a very strong sign that it is going to be a New York Times Best Seller and that it is going to start showing up on other lists,\" Eisenmann says. \"To hit that top slot is huge. It means that a book is selling hugely during the period it is there.\"\nCurrently, the holder of the highest-selling nonfiction release is Hillary Clinton's \"What Happened,\" which sold 300,000 copies in its first week, according to publisher Simon & Schuster, as reported by Fortune .\nThe New York Times In contrast to Amazon, The New York Times Best Seller list is updated every week.\nRankings there are determined by book sales reported to The Times by retailers across the country, the Times' methodology states. But, there is \"no exact number\" of sales that will land you on the list, according to a representative for The Times.\nGathering data from multiple book sellers is a key difference between The Times' list and Amazon, Geiger says.\n\"The secret to cracking the New York Times Best Sellers list is that they only compile the list based on certain stores that report their figures,\" she explains. \"The first question any book lover should ask when you go into a book store is, 'Are you a New York Times reporting bookstore?'\"\nIf popular in the right stores, the number of book sales needed to land on the list might be less than you would think.\n\"Depending on the composition of the overall list, it is possible to crack the New York Times Best Sellers list with 1,000 to 2,000 books per week,\" she says.\n\"There are a few books that sell a gazillion copies \u2014 Stephen King, John Grisham, James Patterson \u2014 and then, everybody else.\"\nDon't miss: An ex-FBI hostage negotiator explains what President Trump and Kim Jong Un get right\u2014and wrong\u2014about persuasion\nLike this story?

That is already nearly half of what the market grew by in all eight years of the Obama administration. Trump's performance, as measured by the S&P 500, is up 23 percent in the year since his inauguration, much better than the 13 percent average of first year performances since 1928. SHARES Luke Sharrett\/Bloomberg via Getty Images \nThe U.S. stock market has added nearly $6.9 trillion in market cap since President Donald Trump was elected, already close to half of what was added in all eight years of President Barack Obama's tenure. \nThe market cap, based on the Russell 3000, surpassed $30 trillion for the first time last week, and was at $30.6 trillion Thursday, according to Bespoke. \n\"I think the performance in the first year has exceeded almost everybody's expectations,\" said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. Hickey uses the Russell 3000 to measure overall market cap, since it represents about 98 percent of all U.S. stocks. \nWhen Trump was elected, stocks rose out of the gate after an initial late night collapse in futures prices. After that, the market rewarded stocks and sectors that would benefit from the \"Trump trade\" and Trump's pro-growth policies. \nThe Trump trade occasionally stalled out when it looked as though tax reform was unlikely, but since the legislation began seriously moving forward and finally became law at the end of last year, the market has been on a tear. The S&P 500 has added 4.6 percent just since the start of this year, after last year's near 20 percent move. \nSource: Bespoke \nThe market's value may have reached peak levels since Trump's election, but in percentage gains since inauguration, Obama was ahead ahead in the first year. From his first inauguration until one year later, the S&P gained 41 percent under Obama. Hickey said the first year average gain for first term presidents since 1928 has been 13 percent. \nTrump's track record is still strong, he said. \"As far as performance is concerned, it was a very good first year, seeing a gain of 23 percent in the S&P 500 in Trump's first year in office,\" said Hickey. \"There were bigger gains under FDR and Obama, but they had the benefit of coming in at a low level, at the late stages of a bear market.\" \nTrump has not been shy about taking credit for a strong stock market , which some see as a risky prospect because stocks don't always go up, as George W. Bush saw during his administration. The market lost $3.3 trillion in value in the Bush years, as measured by the Russell 3000, while it gained $12.3 trillion during the Obama administration.

They're not like the laws of physics, which can be deduced by observing the way the world works. The market is a beast of its own, and rules come from experience.\nCramer's nearly 40 years in the business have taught him some important lessons, lessons that he's made into rules for all the homegamers interested in buying stocks.\nSome lessons he learned the hard way. At his old hedge fund, he'd occasionally convince himself that it was OK to make an exception to his rules, only to get burned in the end.\n\"It's like that old joke about the guy who goes to the doctor and says, 'Doctor, doctor, it hurts when I stretch out and shake my hand around,' to which the doctor replies, 'Then don't do that,'\" Cramer said.\nWhat's Cramer's No. 1 rule for investing? It might ring a bell: Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.\nIt's not unusual to see investors in a bull market get \"intoxicated with their gains,\" he said. But it's exactly at that point that they need to remember not to be pigs.\nCramer learned this one the hard way. When he worked at the trading desk of Michael Steinhardt's hedge fund, the legendary investor told him not to be a pig after he'd racked up a major gain.\n\"I had no idea what he was talking about,\" Cramer said. \"Of course, not that long after, we got a vicious sell-off and I gave back everything I made and then some.\"\nThis is Cramer's No. 1 rule because, above all else, it helps investors stay in the game. From the 2000 dotcom bubble bust to the 2008 financial crisis, 'piggish' buyers got slaughtered, but less greedy investors managed to cut their losses.\nOne of the hardest things about investing is holding on in the face of big declines or market chaos, but short-term pain often translates into long-term gains.\n\"Being cautious and ringing the register near tops ended up keeping you in the game,\" Cramer said. \"Because you never know when stocks you own are going to really get crushed. You never know when the market could be just annihilated. You can't have certainty. If you assume stocks will keep going up forever in a straight line, I think you're going to be in for a world of hurt.\"\nRule No. 2? Don't shirk the tax man.\n\"Look, no one has ever liked paying taxes,\" the \"Mad Money\" host acknowledged. \"But, like death, taxes are inevitable and unavoidable.\"\nSo many investors are loath to pay taxes on their winnings, but Cramer has seen some market players incur serious losses by waiting too long to write a check to Uncle Sam.\nThe fact is, some gains are unsustainable and should be booked quickly, no matter the cost, Cramer said. Taking some profits won't set you back dramatically: It'll keep your portfolio safe.\nThe bottom line? Bulls make money, bears make money, and, well, you know the rest.\n\"Don't be greedy,\" Cramer concluded. \"And a variation on that theme: it's okay to pay the taxes \u2014 don't be so worried about taking a taxable profit, because you may end up with no profit at all.\"\nWATCH: Cramer's top 2 investing rules show chapters Cramer's top 2 investing rules for bulls, bears and everyone in between 19 Hours Ago | 14:10 "}

But Ken Moelis , CEO of Moelis & Co. and a Wall Street veteran, said the magnitude of the changes is bigger than most people realize. \n\"People are underestimating the size and impact of the tax reform,\" Moelis said Friday on CNBC's \" Closing Bell .\" \nThe major change, which slashes the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, will dramatically increase cash flow for U.S. businesses, Moelis said, allowing many to grow. \nOf his own company, an independent global investment bank, Moelis estimated an extra $20 million in revenue from the tax cuts. He predicts an \"M&A wave\" and plans on expanding and hiring new talent with the additional funds. \n\"I think everybody's going through that process right now,\" he said. \"I think the actual addition to this cash flow to people's future plans is causing people to be on their front foot and think about, what do I want to do? What can I accomplish?\" \nThe last major tax reform occurred more than 30 years ago during the Reagan administration with the Tax Reform Act of 1986, simplifying the tax code and eliminating tax shelters.

Nine years into the expansion, he said, growth has been slow at just under 2 percent. \n\"That's not the United States,\" he said. \"That's not what we can do.\" \nA better target, he suggested, was around 3 percent. Concerns over regulations since the financial crisis of 2008 may have been what caused investors to be cautious. \n\"You just didn't know how somebody was going to try to attack your investment and make it unprofitable,\" he said. \"You had this regulatory environment that was attacking most people in America.\" \n\"The quality, the innovation, the law, the consistency of the United States, the system; we should be a 3-percent-plus grower,\" he said. \"And that's a lot of money.\" Kellie Ell News Associate for CNBC Related Securities "}

Marino says she has only donned a pair of skis once more, something she will not be attempting again after falling flat on her face and promptly reverting straight back to her board.\nThat Colorado incident may have sparked a chain of events that finishes on a podium in South Korea but while Marino and her father are refusing to get too carried away, the U.S. team may well have found their star of the future.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by John O'Brien\n "}

Morris 3:40 PM EST \nThe chipmaker Nvidia has altered the terms of service for its GeForce and Titan graphics cards to prohibit their use in data centers, or large-scale commercial or research settings. An exception is included for using the cards for blockchain applications, primarily mining cryptocurrency such as Ethereum. \nThe update, first noted by UK tech site The Register , means organizations running large-scale, intensive applications like artificial intelligence, big data or image recognition will have to invest in the much more expensive cards aimed at data centers. While a high-end GeForce graphics card can cost upwards of $700, enterprise processors like Nvidia\u2019s Tesla V100 run to nearly $10,000. \nNvidia\u2019s change, according to the Register, could present problems for projects that don\u2019t necessarily need the very most powerful processors. The impact on academic research facilities could be particularly acute, but a Nvidia spokesperson told the Register that most academic projects aren\u2019t large enough to fall under their definition of a data center. Further, the spokesperson said Nvidia was willing to \u201cwork with\u201d users making off-license use of the cards. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. \nThe alteration reflects at least a minor tension at the heart of Nvidia\u2019s remarkable corporate evolution. Still best known for high-end graphics cards aimed at PC gamers, Nvidia has been on a sustained diversification push in recent years, with a growing footprint in artificial intelligence , self-driving cars, and, yes, cryptocurrency. \nBut that diversification is rooted in Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards, which have long been powerful enough to be repurposed for other applications. Perhaps most notoriously, graphics cards like the GeForce line have been used in recent years to perform the power-hungry mathematics that secure cryptocurrencies like Ether, leading to surging demand for the cards. \nIn that light, Nvidia\u2019s carving out of an exception for use of their consumer GPUs in cryptocurrency data centers is intriguing. One possible explanation is that, because the cryptocurrency market is widely seen as in the midst of a bubble, Nvidia has not aggressively courted the market and is happy to take short-term card sales. \nThe company has more long-term motivation to push adoption of high-end chipsets for AI and other applications \u2014 though the company stated that the motivation for the license change was simply that consumer-grade cards aren\u2019t designed to operate under the hot and demanding conditions of a data center.

Washington has for years demanded that Islamabad stop providing sanctuary and other support for the Afghan Taliban and the allied Haqqani network. \n(For a graphic of historical U.S. aid to Pakistan, click here: tmsnrt.rs\/2DbVEyQ ) \nAt the time of Trump\u2019s tweet, a U.S. assessment of Pakistani compliance with those demands was still under way. A cohesive U.S. policy - including preparations for possible Pakistani reaction - was not expected to be completed until March or April, three U.S. officials interviewed said. \n\u201cNone of the elements of a coherent policy was in place, or even close at hand, when the president, in effect, made a policy announcement,\u201d said one U.S. official, who like others spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cDespite a mad scramble to backfill a tweet, we still don\u2019t have ... an effective policy in place.\u201d \nMichael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council, did not address whether the tweet had sped up the policy process, saying Trump had made clear his intent to take a new, tougher stance toward Pakistan as part of the Afghanistan war strategy he unveiled in August. \n\u201cThis action is being taken after months of careful interagency review. Any suggestion to the contrary is false,\u201d he said. \nThe State Department declined to comment. \nTrump was at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida when he posted his tweet at 7:12 a.m. on Jan. 1, after hosting a lavish New Year\u2019s Eve party. Until then he had kept a relatively low public profile while he mostly golfed. \nThe United States, he tweeted, had \u201cfoolishly\u201d given Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid and \u201cthey have given us nothing but lies and deceit, thinking our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!\u201d \nIt is not clear what prompted Trump to issue the tweet, which infuriated Pakistani officials. Pakistan\u2019s National Security Committee of senior civilian and military chiefs denounced it as \u201ccompletely incomprehensible.\u201d U.S. Ambassador David Hale was summoned to the foreign ministry for an explanation. People chant slogans as they take part in an anti-U.S. rally in Chaman, Pakistan, January 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Saeed Ali Achakzai \nCaught by surprise on their New Year\u2019s Day holiday, a small group of White House aides and other top officials scrambled to make good on the president\u2019s unexpected statement, said a senior U.S. official who was part of the consultations. \nThere was no time to issue a formal White House policy directive outlining the amount of frozen funds, four officials said. \nWhen the administration confirmed that it was suspending security aid to Pakistan four days after Trump\u2019s tweet, the State Department was still not able to quantify how much aid was at stake, underscoring how far U.S. officials had been from implementing any policy before the president\u2019s statement. \nU.S. officials later said the decision could affect about $1 billion in planned security assistance and $900 million to reimburse Pakistan for counter-terrorism operations. FILE PHOTO:   Trump speaks to the media after the Congressional Republican Leadership retreat at Camp David, Maryland, U.S., January 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Yuri Gripas\/File Photo \nAnother sign of the haste was the failure to give Pakistan the usual diplomatic courtesy of a warning before the president\u2019s tweet, U.S. officials said. \nPerhaps most seriously, they said, there was no time to prepare for possible retaliation. TWEET IN SEARCH OF STRATEGY \nThe Pentagon and State Department were especially concerned that the Pakistani army, which effectively runs foreign policy, might close the air and land corridors on which U.S.-led troops and Afghan forces in landlocked Afghanistan depend for supplies, the officials said. So far, Pakistan has not done so. \nAt the time the decision was made, there was no agreement with neighboring countries for alternative routes, five U.S. officials said. \n\u201cIt appeared to be a tweet in search of a strategy,\u201d said Dan Feldman, a former U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. \n\u201cThere seemed to be a flurry of inter-agency activity after that tweet to arrive at some sort of policy to frame it ... to prove it wasn\u2019t just an impulsive tweet.\u201d \nIt was not the first time that U.S. officials have been caught off guard by Trump\u2019s fondness for formulating policy by tweet. \nLast year, Trump tweeted that the U.S. government would not accept transgender people to serve in the military, catching the Pentagon leadership by surprise. His statement eventually had to be walked back. Editing by Yara Bayoumy and Ross Colvin"}

Stocks valuations are elevated but are relatively cheap by a wide margin, compared to bonds, they say.\nThe strategists, among a few in CNBC's survey at the low end of Wall Street's range, have raised their S&P 500 target to 3,000 from 2,800, and are now in line with the median which had been at 2,975. \n\"While 2017 saw building optimism, 2018 may be the year of euphoria . While valuations have overshot fair value, sentiment is likely to be the most important driver of returns \u2014typical of late stage bull markets,\" they wrote. They put fair value for year end 2018 at 2,636, and they have a long term S&P target of 3,500 by year end 2025.\nSince the start of the year, stocks have been hitting new highs, while bonds have been weaker. The 10-year yield was as high as 2.66 percent last week, the highest since 2014. On Tuesday, it was at 2.61 percent.\nThe tax bill has helped, leading to strong above average earnings revisions. \"With a strong pickup in earnings from repatriation and a lower corporate tax rate amid a sales recovery, we expect corporations to accelerate spending across all categories in 2018,\" they wrote.\nThey see two big potential surprises in corporate spending. They said merger activity could create a record year for mergers and acquisitions, and companies could spend excess cash to pay down their debt to reduce high debt levels as interest rates rise. They also expect debt reduction to be the biggest item that companies spend repatriation proceeds on, as a result of the tax law change requiring corporations to pay U.S. taxes on past profits kept overseas.\nBuybacks will be a top area, but there is also a strong case for capex.\nThe strategists note that the BofA monthly global fund managers' survey shows cash positions dropped to a five-year low of 4.4 percent, a contrarian indicator. They also point out that their own sell side indicator which reflects Wall Street strategists jump in equity allocation recommendations has risen by 5 points, also a contrarian indicator.\n\"But no need to panic yet \u2014 these indicators are still not at the extreme levels of bullishness that typically coincide with the end of bull markets,\" they wrote.

I am utterly captivated by season four of the dystopian Netflix series, which for the unfamiliar is a high-tech spin on The Twilight Zone . I\u2019m still making my way through the binge, but one unsettling episode directed by Jodie Foster, \u201cArkangel,\u201d stuck with me. In it, a mother nearly loses her young daughter after she wanders off at the park. Terrified of a repeat incident, she signs up for Arkangel, a new service that, through use of an implant, allows the parent to use a mobile device to track the child\u2019s location, monitor her vitals, and even see what the child is seeing. A parental mode pixelates in real time any visual that elevates stress. It\u2019s heady stuff. \nYou can quickly see where this goes wrong. Even in our earliest years, negative experiences help us learn how to live in the world. (That pan burned my hand; I should be wary of touching things on the stove.) And what seems like an honest tool for parenting in a child\u2019s earliest years quickly becomes highly invasive when that child grows into a teenager. (Real time visuals? No thanks.) If you saw last year\u2019s film The Circle , based on the Dave Eggers novel , you\u2019ll know this dichotomy well. Or the film Ex Machina two years before it. Or the documentary you\u2019re living every day you scroll through Facebook , sync your Fitbit, or ask Alexa a question. \nWhy the spate of paranoid techno-thrillers? Because we\u2019re still grappling with the implications of capabilities we\u2019ve never had before. We know that fully autonomous vehicles can solve a lot of society\u2019s problems, but we don\u2019t know where they can fail us in other ways besides the obvious. We know that personalized medicine is the way forward, but we haven\u2019t yet seen what happens when that power is abused. And so forth. \nTechno-optimism will be on fantastic display next week at CES, the annual consumer electronics show in Las Vegas. After six (mostly) terrifying episodes of Black Mirror , it might be just what the robo-doctor ordered. \nThis essay was originally published in Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter about technology.

Short positions on Pendragon have nearly trebled since the end of November, according to the FCA. UNSUSTAINABLE BOOM? \nAnother factor latched upon by the short-sellers is the threat to car finance packages that, thanks to a decade of cheap credit, now account for nearly 90 percent of new car purchases \u2013 nearly double the figure in 2006. \nUnder one of the most popular financing options, known as \u201cpersonal contract plans\u201d (PCPs), customers pay a small deposit to lease a car, making lower monthly payments than under a traditional hire-purchase scheme, with the option to return the car at the end of the contract. \nThe risk is that oversupply of used cars in the UK is about to hit the resale prices of cars on which PCP rates are partly based. PCP repayment rates would rise, further choking off demand for new vehicles and hitting dealer profit margins, which can already be as narrow as 2 percent. \nLookers and Pendragon derive the vast majority of their profits from the UK and Ireland, making them more exposed to a British downturn than the more geographically diverse auto manufacturers. \n\u201cPCPs have been a big driver in pushing up the average price of a car,\u201d Trium Capital\u2019s Grewal said. \u201cIt allows you to afford a more expensive model.\u201d \nLast month analysts at JP Morgan warned clients that PCPs had resulted in \u201cunsustainably high volumes of premium vehicle sales\u201d. \nFor the graphic 'Car dealers are suffering from falling sales', click - reut.rs\/2CYVeMx Reporting by Alasdair Pal; Editing by Tom Pfeiffer and David Goodman"}

RESOLVING DEBT ISSUES \nLeEco, an entertainment, electronics and electric vehicles group, has struggled to pay its debts after rapid expansion into multiple sectors sparked a cash crunch, a plunge in the shares of a listed unit and led to multiple defaults. At its peak LeEco owed creditors 10 billion yuan ($1.54 billion). \nIts main listed unit Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp ( 300104.SZ ) said in a statement on Tuesday that it was trying to settle its debt problems to resolve liquidity issues and resume normal business operations. \nLeshi\u2019s Tianjin unit is trying to get 3 billion yuan ($462 million) worth of funding from new and existing investors, as well as creditors, Leshi said in another statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange. That unit\u2019s main business is marketing smart and Internet TVs. \nStruggling to support goals that included beating Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Motors ( TSLA.O ) in premium EV making, Jia has been trying to ride out the cash crunch by taking measures such as cutting staff numbers and selling assets. \nJia said he had asked his wife, Gan Wei, and brother to represent him at Leshi in exercising shareholder rights and handling the sale of assets. Jia stepped down as CEO of the group\u2019s main listed unit in May last year. \nHe also cited a single late payment in July as being one of the key causes of LeEco\u2019s cash-flow problems, saying it led to the freezing of his assets and prompted a slew of early loan recoveries. He said \u201cfalse and malicious\u201d reports had impacted the business. \nJia was placed on an official blacklist of debt defaulters in early December, a move taken by Chinese courts to put pressure on people and entities to repay debts.

A ruling by the court on the case was due this week. \nBritish Airways\u2019 owner IAG said last Friday it would buy Niki for 20 million euros ($24 million) and provide up to 16.5 million euros in additional liquidity to the company. \nThe sale to IAG, which had been in exclusive talks to acquire the airline, appeared to mark the final chapter in the demise of Air Berlin, the former No.2 German air carrier that earlier owned Niki. \nFairplane argues however that Niki, which is registered in as a company in Austria, had been profitable but had lost access to bridge financing when insolvency proceedings were opened in Germany in December, grounding planes and stranding passengers. \nSpokesman Ronald Schmid said that dragging Niki into the German insolvency process was wrong, and that passengers stood a better chance of getting their money back in the Austrian courts. \n\u201cWe want to ensure that the insolvency is carried out in Austria - where it belongs - so that there are no conflicts of interest,\u201d Schmid told Reuters. \nAn IAG spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. \nIn appointing Floether to liquidate Air Berlin in December, a German insolvency judge was of the opinion that, although Niki was registered as a company in Austria, its centre of main interest was in fact in Germany.

They also added 2-1\/2 years to his sentence, condemning him to 12 years in prison. Lula, Brazil's first working-class leader, so far remains free pending future appeals. \nLula, 72, could now be ineligible to stand for election under Brazil's \"Ficha Limpa\" or \"Clean Record\" law, which bans political candidates whose convictions have been upheld by an appellate court. \nLula's exclusion from the October election would radically alter the political landscape ahead of a campaign in which he is the early favorite, with 36 percent of voter preferences according to pollster Datafolha. That is double the percentage of his nearest rival, the far-right congressman and former army captain Jair Bolsonaro, who has been energized by anti-Lula sentiment. \nBut Lula still has options. An electoral court must make the final ruling on a candidacy, and would only do so once a candidate had registered. \nLula can appeal Wednesday's decision by the appeals court in Porto Alegre to Brazil's top appeals court or to the Supreme Court to delay a final ruling, possibly avoiding jail and stringing the process out long enough to register his candidacy by the Aug. 15 deadline. \nAt a nighttime rally in a central Sao Paulo plaza, Lula stood atop a sound truck and rallied supporters, blasting the ruling as a \"lie,\" and strongly maintained his innocence. \nLula said that if the three judges could \"show me the crime I committed, I would give up trying to be a candidate.\" \n\"I want the judges to know that I am not worried like they think I should be,\" Lula said. \"They cannot jail ideas or hope.\" \nOpponents of Lula, meanwhile, celebrated on Sao Paulo's main avenue with a giant blown-up figure of the ex-president dressed as a prison convict. \nBrazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index hit a new intraday high of 83,635 points on news of the ruling. It closed 3.32 percent higher on investor expectations his exclusion from the 2018 race will clear the way for a more market-friendly candidate who can stick to Brazil's austerity agenda. \nBrazil's currency, the real, firmed 3 percent against the U.S. dollar, leading gains in Latin America. \n\"The ruling takes off the table the worst possible scenario for the market, the biggest downside possible in terms of the election,\" said Roberto Campos, a partner at Sao Paulo-based Absolute Investimentos. \"The guy who was completely not market-friendly is out.\" \nMORE CASES \nLula is one of scores of powerful politicians and businessmen caught up in sweeping corruption probes that have wracked the Brazilian establishment since 2014. \nHe faces six more indictments in corruption cases ranging from receiving bribes from engineering firm Odebrecht to obstructing justice and trafficking his influence to obtain government decisions favoring the auto industry. \nHe is among over 100 people convicted in the \"Car Wash\" investigation, the most sprawling of Brazil's numerous probes. It focuses on graft involving oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro, known as Petrobras, and other state-run companies. \nLula was convicted of corruption and money laundering last year for accepting a beachside apartment from an engineering firm vying for contracts with Petrobras. \nProsecutors said the apartment and its refurbishing was a bribe worth 3.7 million reais ($1.1 million). Lula maintains he never owned the penthouse apartment, criticizing prosecutors for what Lula's lawyers called a reliance on the plea bargain testimony of one witness, businessman Leo Pinheiro. \nOne of Lula's lawyers, Cristiano Zanin, said the legal team would continue to fight the case, but that its next concrete steps would be decided in the coming days after they have had a chance to read the full ruling. \nLula's Workers Party called the ruling a \"farce\" orchestrated by Lula's enemies to stop him returning to power. The party said it would resist the decision and push ahead with its plan to launch him as presidential candidate. \n(Reporting by Lisandra Paraguassu in Porto Alegre, Writing and additional reporting by Anthony Boadle in Brasilia, Additional reporting by Bruno Federowski in Brasilia and Pablo Garcia in Sao Bernardo do Campo; Editing by Andrew Hay and Rosalba O'Brien)"}

There was a lot of carry on for a 37,\u201d the quietly spoken 31-year-old recalled. \n\u201cPlaying in the Ashes was a dream. Did that. Winning an Ashes was a dream. We won. Scoring a hundred in the Ashes has always been something I always wanted to do. I\u2019ve done that now too.\u201d \nTest cricket has not always been kind to the left-hander, who has been dropped and recalled from the team several times with questions raised over his ability to play spin and his work ethic. \nSo while captain Steve Smith played his fifth test that January day in 2011 and has now racked up 61, Khawaja has managed less than half that number. \n\u201dIt\u2019s disappointing,\u201c Khawaja said of the criticism. \u201dWhen I am scoring runs, I\u2018m elegant and when I\u2018m not scoring runs I\u2018m lazy. I can\u2019t seem to win, when things aren\u2019t going well. \n\u201dIt\u2019s disappointing to hear but it\u2019s something I have dealt with throughout my career. When I play nothing really changes for me. I go out there and try and score runs every single time. \n\u201cSometimes the game feels really simple and easy and other times it is a bit of a grind. That\u2019s the way it is.\u201d \nA move to Queensland couple of years ago helped revive his international career but it was still particularly pleasurable to finally get a test hundred in front of his family and friends in Sydney. \n\u201cThe SCG was where I grew up playing cricket for New South Wales and an Ashes century is something I have wanted for a long time and I haven\u2019t been able to achieve, so it was very satisfying,\u201d he said. \nAs for the future, Khawaja is hoping to continue scoring runs to secure his place in the test side, both at home and abroad. \n\u201cI love playing for Australia every single test match, every chance I get,\u201d he said. \n\u201dAll I can do is try and go out there and score runs for my team and do well in the top order. \n\u201cI like to be playing every single game, but you can\u2019t look too far ahead either.\u201d (Editing by Sudipto Ganguly)"}

Doctor Katarzyna Koziol injects sperm directly into an egg during in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure called Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) at Novum clinic in Warsaw October 26, 2010. REUTERS\/Kacper Pempel \nWhereas in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), freezing and thawing embryos before implantation offers a better chance of pregnancy and birth, in women without this condition thawed embryos and are no better or worse than fresh embryos, researchers in China and Vietnam have found. \nThe findings may encourage doctors to just implant one embryo at a time, lowering the risks that come when doctors try to implant more, producing multiple births and their associated complications. \nThe papers, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, are \u201cgood news for women seeking in-vitro fertilization,\u201d said Dr. Lan Vuong, chief author of the Vietnamese study. \nAfter an earlier study by the Chinese team showed that frozen embryos were better for women with PCOS, \u201ca lot of people jumped to the conclusion that we should always do frozen. Some programs around the country won\u2019t do fresh transfers anymore,\u201d said Dr. Christos Coutifaris of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia, who was not connected with the new research. \n\u201cNow these two papers, equally large and done in non-PCOS patients, show that in terms of live birth, which is what we care about, there is no difference,\u201d he told Reuters Health by phone. \u201cSo to apply the rule to everybody that we should freeze your embryos is probably not correct.\u201d \nDr. Vuong said that in the past, doctors have often implanted more than one fresh embryo in women because of concerns that a frozen transfer may not work as well. \nThe fact that thawed embryos \u201cproduce the same pregnancy rate with less complications should transform the way in-vitro fertilization is practiced,\u201d she told Reuters Health by email. \u201cAfter the first fresh embryo transfer, it will be possible to freeze the remaining embryos and transfer them one by one, if necessary, without reducing the chance of pregnancy.\u201d \nDr. Vuong, of the University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, and her colleagues also found that women with high levels of the female hormone progesterone might be better off receiving a thawed frozen embryo. \nDr. Coutifaris, who is president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said a higher progesterone level may indicate that the development of the embryo and the womb are out of synch, and using a thawed embryo allows for better timing of the implantation. \nIt\u2019s one example where \u201cthe challenge for us, as practitioners, is to determine who are the patients who will benefit from a freeze-only approach,\u201d he said. \nIn the Chinese study of 2,157 women undergoing their first in-vitro fertilization cycle, the birth rate was 48.7 percent with thawed embryos and 50.2 percent with fresh. Doctors typically implanted two embryos per attempt. \nIn the Vietnam study of 782 women undergoing their first or second attempt, the live birth rates after the first transfer were 33.8 percent with frozen and 31.5 percent for fresh. They also implanted, on average, two at a time. \nIn both studies, the difference in birth rates between the groups was so small that it might have been due to chance. \nNeither study found a higher risk of neonatal or obstetrical complications in either group, although frozen embryo transfer produced a statistically lower risk of over-stimulated ovaries, which leads to swollen and painful ovaries and is potentially dangerous. \nThe rates of the syndrome in the Chinese study were 0.6 percent with frozen embryos and 2.0 percent with fresh. The senior author was Dr. Zi-Jiang Chen of Shandong University, who did not respond to emailed questions. \nIt was the Chen group that, in 2016, reported that frozen-then-thawed embryos offered a 7-percentage-point edge when it came to producing live births among infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome: 49 percent versus 42 percent. The improvement came primarily from a lower rate of pregnancy loss. \n\u201cThe cost for freezing embryos is about 30 percent more than that for fresh transfer,\u201d said Dr. Vuong. \u201cHowever, the effectiveness of the treatment should be considered in decisions about which approach is more cost-effective. We have done a cost-effectiveness analysis of the two treatments and found that freezing embryos and subsequent transfer is not cost-effective over fresh transfer.\u201d \nSOURCES: bit.ly\/2m2bPYw and bit.ly\/2CxHmro The New England Journal of Medicine, online January 10, 2018."}

The National Weather Service forecast winds up to 70 miles per hour (113 km per hour), which downed power lines. \nAlmost 80,000 homes and businesses in the Northeast and Southeast, where the storm struck on Wednesday, were without power. \nUp to 18 inches (46 cm) of snow was forecast for Boston and coastal areas of northern New England. Officials feared fast-dropping temperatures after the storm passed would turn remaining snow on roadways to ice. \nThe storm was powered by a rapid plunge in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters were referring to as bombogenesis or a \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d and which brought high winds and swift, heavy snowfall. \nThe wintry weather has been blamed for at least 14 deaths in the past few days, including four fatalities in North Carolina traffic accidents and three in Texas due to cold. TRAVEL WOES \nNearly 5,000 U.S. airline flights were canceled. New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport temporarily halted all flights due to whiteout conditions, the Federal Aviation Administration said.

It struck a coalition deal with the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO), making Austria the only western European country with a far-right party in government. \nThe FPO controls the interior, foreign, defence and social affairs ministries, among others. \nAt the start of a two-day cabinet meeting in a castle near Slovenia, Kurz said the government would cut benefits for Austrian residents\u2019 children who live in a country where the cost of living is lower. \n\u201cIt is an unfairness built into the system that, for two children who do not even live in Austria but in Romania, roughly 300 euros (267.4 pounds) a month are transferred to Romania and that is almost the average income there,\u201d Kurz told reporters standing alongside Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache. \nPayments vary depending on children\u2019s age and number but start around 114 euros a month for an only child. \n\u201cWe will reach a decision in cabinet here so that child benefit payments are not made abroad to the same extent as before,\u201d Kurz said, adding that adjusting payments to the local cost of living would save \u201cmore than 100 million euros (a year)\u201d.

A rise above $1.2092 would take it to its highest level since January 2015.\nThe euro received its latest boost overnight as data showed the euro zone economy closed out 2017 with the strongest growth in nearly seven years.\nWeighed down by the greenback\u2019s weakness against the euro, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was poised on a loss of 0.3 percent this week, during which it probed a three-month low of 91.751. The index was also headed for its third week of losses.\nThe U.S. currency\u2019s weakness was highlighted overnight as the dollar failed to draw support from stronger-than-expected jobs report. U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, data from ADP Research Institute showed, the biggest monthly increase since March.\nThe markets are now focused on Friday\u2019s U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which is expected to show job gains of 190,000 for December.\nGiven the dollar\u2019s recent poor showing, market participants reckon stronger-than-expected employment gains and growth in wages would be needed to turn fortunes around for the currency.\n\u201cIt is the same theme from 2017 that is hurting the dollar, which is low inflation concerns, which in turn has capped Treasury yields,\u201d said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.\n\u201cThe euro, on the other hand, is on a roll. We see the euro zone HICP figures out later today and if that proves to be strong, that could offset a decent U.S. jobs report from the dollar\u2019s perspective,\u201d Ishikawa said.\nThe euro zone\u2019s harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) for December is due later on Friday.\nThe Australian dollar extended gains from the previous day and rose to $0.7869, its highest since Oct. 20.\nThe Aussie was on track for its fourth straight week of gains, with the recent surge in prices of commodities like copper and iron ore providing a lift.\nThe Canadian dollar has also benefited from surging commodities, with crude oil prices at their highest since 2015.\nThe loonie was headed for its third straight week of gains, having touched a 2-1\/2-month high of C$1.2485 per dollar overnight.\nThe yen was an exception among the major currencies, having sunk this week against its peers like the dollar, euro and Aussie.\nThe Japanese currency depreciated against the broadly weaker greenback due to increasing investor appetite for risk in the broader markets, which dimmed its allure as a perceived safe haven.\nThe dollar was little changed at 112.790 yen after rising about 0.2 percent on Thursday. It was little changed against the yen this week, during which it had momentarily slipped to a two-week low of 112.055 on Tuesday. (Editing by Kim Coghill)\n "}

A cryptocurrency backed by a sovereign government would be even bigger.\nBut while Venezuela claims it is going to do both very soon with the petro, experts are doubtful the country has the capabilities or the characteristics to achieve its goal.\nThe petro will be dogged by a major question, \"Is it redeemable, in other words, can you take physical delivery?\" notes finance professor Stephen McKeon of the University of Oregon.\nThe strength of any currency backed by a commodity, regardless of whether it is physical or digital, is that holders must believe they can exchange it for the actual commodity. When the U.S. was on the gold standard, individuals could bring their dollars to a bank and exchange them for physical gold.\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says each petro will be worth the equivalent of one barrel of oil, and he has specifically designated the oil from field one of the Ayacucho block in the Orinoco region of Venezuela, which contains more than 5 billion barrels.\nBut McKeon says Venezuela carries a lot of \"counterparty risk\" because it has little rule of law and falling oil production. If Venezuela fails to deliver the oil, he asks, what is the legal recourse for holders?\nJoshua Satten, blockchain partner at Wipro, also questions whether Venezuela is a \"sound enough government\" to instill confidence in would-be miners and holders of the petro.\nVenezuela oil-backed cryptocurrency to launch in days, government says Several other countries are examining the possibility of a sovereign-backed currency. Sweden is studying the possibility of an e-krona. Singapore is considering a digital currency as well, the ubin. Estonia is considering the estcoin.\nBut none are moving as fast as Venezuela. Maduro has made clear the move is designed to help the country evade sanctions imposed by the U.S., Canada and the EU for human rights violations. And he also aims to help alleviate the country's economic woes.\nVenezuela's oil is currently trading at around $50 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate trades at about $61. (Venezuela trades as at discount because it is heavy oil, containing higher levels of sulfur.)\nEven so, 100 million units would bring in $5 billion in much needed revenue.\nDespite their doubts about the petro in particular, blockchain experts assert there will soon be many \"asset-backed\" digital currencies. In fact, the Royal Mint of the United Kingdom has already started one backed by gold \u2014 the RMG.\nFive predictions for digital currencies in 2018 \u2014 including stomach-churning drops, bitcoin-related IPO Satten at Wipro also has numerous technical doubts about the government's plans. \"They haven't advised what protocol on which they plan to build, or are they going to build their own?\" he said. Satten also questions their ability to maintain security.\nThere may be more answers come Jan. 14, when Maduro has called for a meeting of all those who will mine the currency. Technical details will be reportedly be released that day.\nAnother issue: oil, unlike gold, is an asset that eventually disappears when it's used. \"How are they going to retire coins?\" asked Satten.\nThe government's explicit desire to evade sanctions bothers those who want to legitimize blockchain. Ultimately, Satten says what Venezuela is trying to achieve isn't a cryptocurrency, but \"a digitized barter system that sidesteps the global financial system. It's a bit scary and very concerning.\""}

I believe we had an experienced team -- eight or nine internationals. It would be easy to think that was the problem.\u201d \nEarlier in the day Rodney Parade in south Wales had supplied some old-fashioned Cup magic as Newport became the latest underdogs to embarrass once mighty Leeds -- sparking a joyful pitch invasion by the home faithful. \nGaetano Berardi\u2019s deflected ninth-minute strike had looked like winning the tie for Leeds, who were knocked out by minor league Sutton United last season, but Conor Shaughnessy\u2019s own goal 15 minutes from time set up a thrilling climax. \nMcCoulsky ensured it was one of the best days in modest Newport\u2019s history with an unstoppable header. \n\u201cI can\u2019t remember most of it, it was a blur to be honest. It is definitely one of my best goals, to knock Leeds out of the FA Cup is what dreams are made of,\u201d he said. \nLeeds also suffered a shock Cup defeat across the other side of the Severn Bridge in 2002, falling to Cardiff at a time when Leeds were Premier League title contenders. \nTo complete a dismal day for Leeds they had substitute Samuel Saiz sent off in stoppage time.

The plan aimed to gain the confidence of investors that the airline could expand its profit margin and increase revenue, but instead stoked fears of low fares and higher costs. \nUnited shares fell more than 11 percent on Wednesday, while American lost 6 percent and Southwest and Delta each shed around 5 percent.\nIn late 2016, Berkshire revealed a surprise bet on the sector, which Buffett had previously shunned. Years of post-bankruptcy consolidation among carriers and a decline in fuel prices has helped airlines rake in record profits in recent years.\nThe Berkshire CEO told CNBC in February that airlines \"had a bad first century.\" They're kind of like the Chicago Cubs,\" he said. \"And they got that century out of the way, I hope.\"\nNow airlines are facing more competition from low-cost rivals as well as rising fuel prices, but strong economic growth and strong business travel demand is expected to be a tailwind for the sector.\nInvestors will next focus on American Airlines and several of its competitors, including JetBlue and Southwest, which are scheduled to report their quarterly profits on Thursday morning."}

(Reuters) - The judge overseeing the bankruptcy of Takata Corp\u2019s ( TKTDQ.PK ) U.S. unit on Wednesday cleared the way for the company\u2019s creditors to vote on its Chapter 11 plan, which critics say limits the legal rights of those injured by its deadly airbags. The logo of Takata Corp is seen on its display at a showroom for vehicles in Tokyo, Japan, February 9, 2017. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai \nTakata and its U.S. entity TK Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy in June after more than 100 million of its airbags were recalled because they could inflate with too much force and spray metal fragments. \nThe airbags have been linked to at least 180 injuries and 18 deaths, including one in Louisiana that was identified last month. \nDuring Wednesday\u2019s hearing, the judge reviewed the adequacy of TK Holdings\u2019 disclosures, which attempt to summarize and translate the dense legalese of the company\u2019s proposed reorganization plan. \nCritics have said the plan favours automakers over car owners. They used the hearing to test arguments that could be raised again at a Feb. 13 confirmation hearing, when U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon in Wilmington, Delaware, will decide if the plan is fair and meets other requirements. \nShannon raised the possibility on Wednesday that he might not approve a proposal contained in the reorganization plan to establish a fund to compensate those with personal injury claims caused by airbags in vehicles made by Honda Motor Co Ltd ( 7267.T ). \nThe trust would pay compensation based on the injury, ranging from $10,000 for bruising to $5 million for death or loss of eyesight, according to court documents. \nCar owners would be barred from suing Honda and other car makers could opt to join the trust arrangement. \nSander Esserman, a lawyer representing car owners seeking to recover costs related to the recall, criticized the trust proposal because it limited the rights of consumers by barring punitive damages and paying compensation in installments. \nHonda\u2019s attorney, Jessica Boelter of Sidley Austin, said the company was owed $9.4 billion from the recall, which she said was the biggest claim of any automaker. \nTakata plans to sell its viable operations to Key Safety Systems, an affiliate of China\u2019s Ningo Joyson Electric Corp ( 600699.SS ), for $1.6 billion.

In Australia, Rio Tinto and BHP, along with\nFortescue Metals Group aim to add about 170 million tonnes of new capacity over the next several years.\nThe forecast price decline \u2014 from an average of $64.30 a tonne in 2017 \u2014 continues into 2019, when the steelmaking raw material will average only $49 a tonne, according to the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science.\n\"The iron ore price is expected to experience some ongoing volatility in early 2018, as the market responds to uncertainty regarding the impact of winter production restrictions on iron ore demand,\" the department warned in its latest commodities outlook paper.\nIron ore currently sells for about $75 a tonne.\nThe lower prices will reflect growing supply from low-cost producers and moderating demand from China as the steel industry there contracts, the department said.\nChina is in the process of closing ageing, high-polluting steel mills and induction furnaces to curb overcapacity in the sector.\nChina's President Xi Jinping said in October that fighting pollution was one of the country's key tasks through 2020.\nAustralia's liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports are forecast to climb to 76.5 million tonnes in the year to end-June 2019, from 63 million tonnes forecast for the 2017\/18 fiscal year and 52 million tonnes last year.\nBetween 2016\/17 and 2018\/19, LNG should add A$14 billion ($11 billion) to Australia's export earnings, while iron ore is forecast to subtract A$10 billion, according to the department.\nThe shift follows the construction of $180 billion of new gas projects. The rise in LNG earnings will be underpinned as three remaining projects under construction hit their stride, it said. These are Chevron's Wheatstone project, Inpex's Ichthys and Royal Dutch Shell's Prelude.\nPrices for coking coal, another key steel-making ingredient, are forecast by the department to drift lower over the next eighteen months from last quarter's benchmark price of $192 a tonne as rising supply more than offsets demand.\nIt also expects thermal coal prices to ease through 2018 and early 2019, with the Newcastle spot price forecast to drop 12 percent to an average $77 a tonne in 2018, and by a further 6 percent to $70 in 2019."}

BREXIT \n\u201cThe two main reasons are business-led and consumer confidence and the confusion around diesel which has caused hold-off,\u201d he said of last year\u2019s fall. \n\u201cThe first quarter is going to be tough and March (last year) in particular was an all-time record month. We ain\u2019t going to get that next March.\u201d \nBritain\u2019s automotive sector is also concerned its cars could face tariffs of up to 10 percent and be hit by customs delays if the government fails to strike the right Brexit deal. \nThere are investment decisions which are pending as companies await clarification on the terms of a transitional deal which will bridge Britain\u2019s exit from the EU in March 2019 into a new relationship with the bloc, Hawes said. \n\u201cSome of those decisions are overdue, they need clarity urgently and certainly the turn of the first quarter is what they have been saying to me,\u201d he said. \nHonda is one of several carmakers considering contingency plans involving possible extra warehousing and stockpiling of parts and has said it needs clarity by March on a transitional deal. \nHawes said any additional cost borne by British plants could hit the sector. \n\u201cThat\u2019s the thin end of the wedge ... How do you secure that next piece of investment when you\u2019re less competitive because you\u2019ve got to warehouse?\u201d (Editing by Mark Potter)"}

Debenhams\u2019s 2021s are trading around 96, according to Tradeweb data. \nNew Look and House of Fraser carry distressed ratings, at Caa2\/CCC+ and Caa1\/B-, respectively, while Debenhams is now rated B1\/BB-. NEAR THE END? \nWith New Look plummeting further into distressed territory and the threat to its supply chain and cashflows, questions arise as to how much longer the company can steer through its troubles. \nThe loss of these protections have had disastrous consequences for retailers historically, leading to the insolvency of Woolworth, for example. \nUK news reports also said that, in addition to New Look\u2019s poor financial results, credit insurers have also been spooked by South African retailer Steinhoff\u2019s accounting scandal. Steinhoff\u2019s biggest shareholder, Christo Wiese, is also the largest stakeholder in Brait, which owns New Look. \nWhile one investor called the developments the \u201cend of the game\u201d for New Look, another stressed that it all came down to the company\u2019s liquidity position. \nThe company has \u00a3208.4m available in cash and liquidity facilities, \u00a3100m of which is an undrawn revolving credit facility, according to an investor presentation for its results for the 26 weeks ending on September 23. \nNew Look will need to pay around \u00a376m-equivalent in coupon payments on its three outstanding bonds in May, according to Thomson Reuters data. \n\u201cThe revolving credit facility has clearly gotten them through the Christmas season, so the important thing is how they\u2019ve ended Christmas and whether they\u2019ve still got access to the revolving credit facility and how much cash they have on balance sheet,\u201d the second investor said. \nNew Look is expected to release its next quarterly results in early February. \n\u201cWe have the liquidity and operating facilities to implement our plans - and we have the time to recover,\u201d the company had told investors in the presentation, adding that Brait remains committed to being a long-term shareholder. \nNew Look declined to comment on it latest supply chain troubles. STERLING PIPELINE? \nOne syndicate banker said volatility around the names could have impacts on sentiment around anticipated high-yield bond deals for UK consumer names, such as Pure Gym and Matalan. \n\u201cI think the UK is a bit different - the retailers that have issued bonds recently have been more from continental Europe who will get bailed out by growth in Europe,\u201d the banker said. \nBut, with other retailers such as Poundland, Next and John Lewis releasing strong results last week, a case-by-case evaluation of UK consumer names is likely to continue, as in 2017.

Getting married and having kids. Buying a home. But the No. 1 answer for many, it turns out, is reaching a certain salary. \nIn ThermoSoft's 2018 \" Making it in America \" survey, the corporation asked 2,000 Americans: \"If you haven't yet 'made it,' what's missing?\" Two-thirds of respondents, or 67 percent, said \"income.\" \nTo feel like they have \"made it,\" respondents said they would need an average annual income of $147,104. \nThat's an income of more than double the national median ( $57,617 as of 2016). But it's not unattainable. In fact, depending on where you live and the size of your household, a salary around $150,000 can put you squarely in the middle class . \nAnd while many people want to earn more, immense wealth isn't necessarily the goal: 77 percent of respondents would not want a salary of more than $1 million, even if it was offered. \nAfter all, a separate study found that just 11 percent of Americans say getting rich is essential to achieving the American Dream . Instead, Americans prefer goals like freedom of choice, having a good family life and being able to retire comfortably. \nTo be fair, all of those require having funds, since money can offer options and flexibility. Still, as both surveys suggest, it isn't everything. Grant Sabatier, a web designer in his 30s who went from broke to seven figures in five years , learned this the hard way. \n\"I have lost a few friends and strained other relationships because I've spent too much time staying late in the office or hustling on the weekends,\" he told CNBC Make It . show chapters 3:02 PM ET Mon, 20 March 2017 | 00:47 \nAs a solution, Sabatier decided to set lifestyle goals instead of monetary ones, by asking questions like, What do you want to do with your money? How many hours a week do you want to work? How much do you want to travel? \nWhile money can pave the way to the American dream by allowing home ownership and a comfortable retirement, as Sabatier learned, it's best seen as a means to an end: \"Even though I truly believe that having money is freedom, money is really just a tool to make experiences in life possible.\""}

Heavy snow pounded the East Coast along a front stretching from Maine as far south as North Carolina early on Thursday, taking out power lines, icing over roadways and closing hundreds of schools. \nPrices for heating oil HO-NYH HO-DIFF-NYH and natural gas in the U.S. Northeast hit their highest levels in years on the back of near-record heating demand. Benchmark U.S. heating oil futures are near their highest in almost three years. \nU.S. natural gas demand was expected to remain near record highs this week. Natural gas is the major fuel for residential and commercial heating in the U.S. Northeast and is also widely used by power plants. \nOn Wednesday, natural gas futures fell 1.6 percent to $3.008 per million British thermal units, but cash prices in New York and New England remain elevated. \n\u201cNYMEX Henry Hub prices should rise further to the mid-$3 range, as cash Henry Hub prices already traded above $6. But the market, due to the supposed record-breaking production growth in 2018, still seems to be under-appreciating the potential for cold weather persisting,\u201d Citi analysts said in a note. \nNew England\u2019s cash prices LNG-CG-BS-SNL soared last week, and remain near four-year highs at $36.32 per mmBtu. ISO-New England, that region\u2019s power grid operator, said on Thursday that its power operators were relying more heavily on generators that burn heating oil, due to heavy natural gas demand from homes and businesses. \n\u201cWe expect to have sufficient capacity and fuel available and expect to be able to weather the storm without running up against significant emissions limits, but concerns remain the same regarding fuel availability and emissions limits throughout this protracted cold spell and the rest of the winter,\u201d the company said in a statement. \nThere are fears that a significant disruption could lead to a heating oil shortage, as distillate inventories, including heating oil, in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions are currently at their lowest levels for this time of year since 2015. \nThis has spurred tankers carrying diesel and heating oil to set out from Europe bound for the United States to address supply worries, reversing a traditional trade route. \nIcebreakers have been used in key ports of Boston, New York and Philadelphia to keep shipping lanes clear, though delays are expected, and the Coast Guard said late Wednesday that those ships will remain at shore until the storm passes. \nReliance on heating oil is highest in the Northeast region, with about 21 percent of households using oil for space heating. \nSo far, most northern U.S. refiners are not reporting problems. Phillips 66 shut a crude and coking unit at its Wood River, Illinois, refinery after a line froze followed by a brief fire, a source told Reuters on Wednesday. It did not currently have a timeline for restarting the units at the Illinois plant, the source said. \nPhiladelphia Energy Solutions postponed planned work at its 335,000 refinery complex in Philadelphia until after the storm. \nValero\u2019s 125,000 bpd refinery in Meraux, Louisiana, restarted most operations after sub-freezing conditions froze instruments earlier this week, according to a report by Energy News Today (ENT). \nValero was forced to cut rates at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery due to the cold weather, ENT reported, and operations are expected to return to normal by the end of the week.

But a recently discovered security flaw in chips made by Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and ARM highlights another important concern: bugs potentially affecting hardware found in the majority of computing devices.\nScale helps justify the massive investment needed to develop improved semiconductor technology and produce chips. Intel last year said it would spend $7 billion on a U.S. factory, and it had already started building the facility years ago. The dominance of a few players also helps ensure compatibility between machines. The downside is that hardware flaws like the newly revealed Meltdown and Spectre affect a huge number of users and could become systemic. It\u2019s an analogous problem to vulnerabilities in the once-dominant Microsoft Windows operating system \u2013 or, in the agricultural world, to a disease affecting a widely used crop variety, like the preponderant but under-threat Cavendish banana.\nSecurity researchers on Wednesday published details of Meltdown and Spectre. The first affects Intel chips and potentially allows hackers to steal secret passwords by evading the hardware barrier between applications and a protected part of a computer\u2019s memory. The second also affects AMD and some ARM chips, and means hackers could trick applications into giving up information. Software groups like Apple and Microsoft had patches ready for Meltdown but not Spectre, which is less easily fixed but also harder to exploit.\nResearch outfit Gartner reckons no single semiconductor vendor has more than a 15 percent share across all processor types, with Samsung last year displacing Intel for the top spot because of booming memory-chip sales. But in specific sub-sectors \u2013 like personal-computer or data-centre chips \u2013 single vendors dominate. The $200 billion Intel has more than 90 percent of the market for central processing units used in servers, for example, while it and AMD have long dominated PC microprocessors.\nTrue, vulnerabilities in chip design are rare. And the diligent patching of security holes helps mitigate the danger. But as semiconductors increasingly spread to homes, cars and factories through the Internet of Things, the risk is that a winner-takes-all chip industry effectively makes a few manufacturers\u2019 products too big to fail.\n "}

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (C) sits next to Cabinet Secretary Tzachi Braverman (R) and Israeli Minister for Jerusalem Affairs Zeev Elkin (L) at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem January 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Abir Sultan\/Pool \nNetanyahu\u2019s public comments appeared to reflect a desire to show support for a major ally, but also concern that choking off funds would deepen Palestinian hardship and could put Israel and militants on a course for war. \nWith Palestinians seething over U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recognition last month of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, he threatened on Tuesday to withhold aid money, accusing them of being \u201cno longer willing to talk peace\u201d. \nOn Friday, in a report denied by a State Department official, the Axios news site said Washington had frozen $125 million in funding for UNRWA. The U.N. agency, founded in 1949 to aid Palestinian refugees, is a main provider of educational and health services in the Gaza Strip. \nNetanyahu said UNRWA was \u201can organisation that perpetuates the Palestinian problem.\u201d \n\u201cIt also enshrines the narrative of the so-called \u2018right of return\u2019. Therefore, UNRWA should pass from the world,\u201d he told a weekly cabinet meeting. \nNetanyahu made almost identical comments about dismantling UNRWA in June - a message he said at the time he had conveyed to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

Gunness said the agency had not been \u201cinformed directly of a formal decision either way by the U.S. administration\u201d on cuts. \nIn addition to its services in Gaza, UNRWA operates in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. editing by John Stonestreet"}

Morgan Asset Management, said in a new report Tuesday.\n\"It is only emerging markets and the U.S. which have seen valuations creep higher as share prices rose by more than earnings expectations. With emerging market valuations starting from a low base, only U.S. valuations look somewhat expensive compared with their long-run average,\" he added.\nIn the eyes of J.P. Morgan, a healthier U.S. labor market; easy credit conditions in Europe and data indicating further equity price gains in 2018 support the idea that there's further room to run in the stock market.\nHowever, some analysts do not agree with this assessment. Peter Toogood, chief information officer at Embark Group, told CNBC last week that in the current market conditions, there is little on offer that's interesting.\n\"Bonds are insane and fixed, equities are on highs that don't make sense \u2026 The only diversifier is gold and cash, that's the only thing left, because everything is expensive, period,\" Toogood said. Also, Sonja Laud, head of equity at Fidelity International, told CNBC that \"there's not a lot left\" for those seeking to make returns in the short term.\n\"Am I willing to go for the last percentage points or do I much more enter the camp of protecting the downside?

He added: \"Realistically I think it's pretty unlikely that you'll get enough of a tightening this year to cause problems.\"\nJ.P.

It said on its website that \"federal government operations vary by agency.\"\nThe Department of Defense published a memo on its site detailing who does and does not get paid in a shutdown and saying that civilian employees were on temporary leave, except for those needed to support active-duty troops.\nThe Department of Interior, led by Secretary Ryan Zinke, offered no guidance on its website, which still had a \"Happy Holidays from the Zinke Family\" video near the top of the site. The department oversees national parks and federal lands.\nThe State Department website said: \"At this time, scheduled passport and visa services in the United States and at our posts overseas will continue during the lapse in appropriations as the situation permits.\"\n'Dreamers' drama The U.S. government had not previously been shut down since 2013, when about 800,000 federal workers were put on furlough. The impasse preventing passage of a needed funding bill centered on former Democratic President Barack Obama's health-care law.\nThe problem this time focused on immigration policy, principally President Donald Trump's order last year ending an Obama program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which gave legal protections to \"Dreamer\" immigrants.\nshow chapters Government shutdown closes Statue of Liberty to visitors over the weekend 5 Hours Ago | 01:58 The \"Dreamers\" are young people who were brought to the United States illegally as children by their parents or other adults, mainly from Mexico and Central America, and who mostly grew up in the United States.\nTrump said last year he would end DACA on March 5 and asked Congress to come up with a legislative fix before then that would prevent the Dreamers from being deported.\nDemocrats have withheld support for a temporary funding bill to keep the government open over the DACA issue. McConnell extended them an olive branch on Sunday, pledging to bring immigration legislation up for debate after Feb. 8 so long as the government remained open.\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer objected to that plan and it was unclear whether McConnell's pledge would be enough for Democrats to support a stopgap funding bill.\nCongress failed last year to pass a complete budget by Oct. 1, the beginning of the federal fiscal year, and the government had since been operating on a series of three stopgap spending bills.\nRepublicans control both the House of Representatives and the Senate, where they have a slim 51-49 majority. But most legislation requires 60 Senate votes to pass, giving Democrats leverage in that chamber.\nTrump earlier this month told a bipartisan Senate working group that he would sign whatever DACA legislation was brought to him. The Republican president then rejected a bipartisan measure and negotiations stalled.\nMcConnell had previously insisted that the Senate would not move to immigration legislation until it was clear what could earn Trump's support.\nRepublican Senator Jeff Flake , who is involved in bipartisan immigration negotiations, said McConnell's statements on Sunday indicated progress in negotiations and he urged his Democratic colleagues to approve another stopgap bill."}

The 3,100 gold coins, 45 bars, and more than 80 pounds of dust recovered from the wreckage of the S.S. Central America steamship. The gold will be on display Feb. 22-24 at the Long Beach Convention Center. Published 5 Hours Ago The Associated Press Jae C. Hong | AP Chief scientist Bob Evans looks at gold bars recovered from the S.S. Central America steamship that went down in a hurricane in 1857 in a laboratory Tuesday, Jan. 23, 2018, in Santa Ana, Calif. More than $50 million worth of gold bars, coins and dust described as the greatest lost treasure in U.S. history is about to make its public debut in California. \nMore than $50 million worth of gold bars, coins, and dust that's been described as the greatest lost treasure in U.S. history is about to make its public debut in California after sitting at the bottom of the ocean for more than 150 years. \nThe 3,100 gold coins, 45 gold bars and more than 80 pounds (36 kilograms) of gold dust recovered from the wreckage of the S.S. Central America steamship are now sitting in a makeshift laboratory just south of Los Angeles. \nBob Evans, the chief scientist on the original voyage that discovered the shipwreck and its treasure in 1988, is now painstakingly cleaning each piece of gold by hand, soaking it in a solution and brushing off rust and grime that accumulated as the treasure sat 7,000 feet (2,134 meters) below sea level. \n\"This is a whole new season of discovery,\" Evans told The Associated Press this week from the laboratory in Santa Ana. \"We are now peering beneath the grime and the rust that is on the coins, removing those objects and those substances and getting to look at the treasure as it was in 1857.\" \nCentral America was laden with booty from the California Gold Rush when it sank in a hurricane off the coast of South Carolina in 1857. Four hundred and twenty-five people drowned and thousands of pounds of California gold were lost, contributing to an economic panic. \nUsing sable paintbrushes and a cleaning solution, Evans has been restoring the gold \u2014some of which is completely caked over in black gunk \u2014 to its original luster for the past two weeks. He will continue that work through February, when the treasure will go on public display at the Long Beach Convention Center, just south of Los Angeles. \nThe gold is all for sale. Just one tiny coin alone could go for $1 million because of its combination of rarity and the history behind it, said Dwight Manley, managing partner of the California Gold Marketing Group, which is displaying and selling the gold. \n\"This is something that in hundreds of years people will still be talking about, reading about, looking back on and collecting things from,\" Manley said. \"There's no other ships that sank that haven't been recovered that rival this or are similar to this, so it's really a once-in-a-lifetime situation.\" \nMeanwhile, the deep-sea treasure hunter responsible for finding the gold in the first place continues to sit in an Ohio jail over his handling of the original treasure recovered from Central America. \nTreasure hunter and Ohio native Tommy Thompson found the ship in 1988 after convincing 161 local investors to fund the voyage for nearly $13 million. \nA lengthy battle ensued over who owned the gold, with Thompson and his investors eventually emerging as the victors over a group of insurance companies. Thompson's company sold 532 gold bars and thousands of coins to the California Gold Marketing Group for about $50 million in 2000. \nInvestors never saw any of those proceeds. In 2005, they sued Thompson, who then went into seclusion in Florida and later became a fugitive after an Ohio judge issued a warrant for his arrest in 2012. \nAuthorities tracked Thompson to a Florida hotel room in 2015. A judge has held Thompson in contempt since December 2015 for violating terms of a plea deal by refusing to answer questions about the location of 500 missing gold coins. He's been jailed ever since. \nThompson has previously said the coins were turned over to a trust in Belize. He has also said that the $50 million from the sale of the gold mostly went toward legal fees and bank loans. \nRecovered in 2014, the gold going on display in California next month is only the second round of treasure brought up from the Central America. \nManley, of the California Gold Marketing Group, bought the gold from investors this month. It was the first time investors saw returns since their initial investment in the 1980s, though some of them died waiting to see such a day. \nThe gold will be on display Feb. 22-24 at the Long Beach Convention Center.

A spokesman for Pai at the FCC, for its part, only said Thursday: \"We do not comment on security measures or concerns.\"\nBut sources at the agency said that federal law enforcement had intervened in the matter, and other FCC offices are expected to be briefed on the matter. The FBI did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\nA spokeswoman for the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on the annual Las Vegas-based trade show, also declined to comment.

FILE PHOTO: A man wearing a respiratory protection mask walks toward an office building during the smog after a red alert was issued for heavy air pollution in Beijing's central business district, China, December 21, 2016. REUTERS\/Jason Lee\/File Photo \nResearchers examined data on birth defects for almost 290,000 infants born in Ohio from 2006 to 2010, matching these records with air pollution measurements near mothers\u2019 homes. \nThey focused on what\u2019s known as fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter that\u2019s found in traffic exhaust and can include dust, dirt, soot, and smoke. \nHigher levels of PM 2.5 exposure in the month before and after pregnancy were associated with a small but statistically meaningful increased risk of congenital birth defects, the study found. \n\u201cOur study indicates that there are several particularly vulnerable exposure periods near the time of conception, both before and after conception, in which exposure to higher levels of particulate matter in the air may pose an increased chance for a birth defect to occur,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Emily DeFranco of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in Ohio. \nThe impact of particulate matter on birth defects varied based on how far women lived from air quality monitoring stations. \nOverall, when researchers looked at every mother in the study, women were exposed to average PM 2.5 levels of 13.79 micrograms per cubic meter of air (ug\/m3) during the months just before and after they conceived. This included women who lived within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of an air quality monitoring station. \nWhen researchers looked at a subset of women who lived within 5 kilometers of a monitoring station, they found that for every 10 ug\/m3 increase in PM 2.5 levels women experienced during the month after conception, their babies were 19 percent more to be born with birth defects. \nCertain types of birth defects appeared more strongly connected to air pollution, including abdominal malformations and what\u2019s known as hypospadias, an abnormality in boys that occurs when the opening of the urethra doesn\u2019t develop on the tip of the penis and instead forms on the shaft or on the scrotum. \nAt the time of the study, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standard for particulate matter levels was 15 ug\/m3, while the current standard is 12 ug\/m3, researchers note in the Journal of Pediatrics. \n\u201cOur study results support the importance of public health education and initiatives to minimize population exposure to airborne pollutants,\u201d DeFranco said. \nThe study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how mothers\u2019 exposure to air pollution might influence the odds of birth defects in their babies. The study also only examined air pollution near women\u2019s homes, and not necessarily near where they worked or spent the most time outdoors. \nEven so, it makes sense for women to limit their exposure to air pollution whenever possible whether by avoiding outdoor commutes during rush hour or concentrating on indoor air quality, said Dr. Shruthi Mahalingaiah, an environmental health researcher at Boston University who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \n\u201cIf you live in areas of the world with high levels of ambient air pollution, you may consider installing appropriate air or ventilation systems so that your in-home air quality is excellent,\u201d Mahalingaiah advised. \u201cIdeally, working together with policy makers, companies, and nations to reduce emissions and innovate around sequestering current levels of emissions would be a goal.\u201d \nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2E47lqR Journal of Pediatrics, online December 10, 2017."}

Some 40 percent of the population identifies as Catholic and the Church has long filled voids in education, healthcare and other services left by an absent state. \nIts bishops have frequently spoken out against human rights abuses by the government and alleged plans by Kabila to remove term limits that forbid him to run for re-election. \nHowever, it reverted to a more neutral posture as Kabila\u2019s mandate expired in December 2016 in order to broker a deal between the ruling coalition and opposition leaders. \nUnder the Dec. 31 agreement, Kabila was permitted to stay in office beyond the expiry of his mandate but required to step down after an election to be held in 2017. \nInstead, Congo\u2019s electoral commission said later that the election could not be organized until December 2018, reviving suspicions that Kabila intends to cling to power. Kabila denies those charges and blames the delays on a slow voter registration process. \nDozens have died in protests over Kabila\u2019s future in the past two years and militia violence across the country has also risen, stoking fears the country will slide back into the kind of civil war that killed millions at the turn of the century.

It confirmed on Thursday that 11 locations are set to close early this year. With such a massive portfolio of stores, Macy's has been forced to rethink its strategy and right-size its real estate, hoping those bets will pay dividends in the long run. \nMacy's stock fell more than 7 percent Thursday morning on the news. \nMacy's comparable sales on an owned basis rose 1 percent during the months of November and December compared with the same period last year. On a licensed and owned basis, same-store sales were up 1.1 percent. \nFollowing the better-than-expected results, Macy's narrowed the range of its prior fiscal 2017 sales guidance and raised its full-year earnings outlook. To be sure, the company has yet to return to same-store sales growth. \nMacy's now expects comparable sales on an owned basis to fall 2.4 percent to 2.7 percent, whereas total revenue is expected to drop 3.6 to 3.9 percent in fiscal 2017. Previously, Macy's had forecast total comparable sales to decline by 2.2 to 3.3 percent, while annual revenue was projected to fall by 3.2 to 4.3 percent. \n\"Macy's success comes with a few caveats,\" GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders wrote in a note to clients. \n\"The first is that growth remains relatively weak and comes off the back of soft prior year comparatives when comparable sales fell by 2.1%,\" Saunders said. \"The second is that while Macy's grew, it did so by far less than the overall sector; as such it is still losing market share both in total and within a number of key categories.\" \nMacy's said it expects full-year earnings to benefit from the recent federal tax reform, which will result in an effective annual tax rate that is about 1 point lower than the retailer previously estimated. \nThe company raised its fiscal 2017 earnings outlook to a range of $3.59 and $3.69 per share, excluding the impact of various store closings and other costs associated with debt repurchases. Excluding the impact of an anticipated fourth-quarter gain on the sale of a building in San Francisco, adjusted earnings should fall within $3.11 and $3.21 per share. \n\"We saw improved sales trends in our stores and continued to see double-digit growth on our digital platforms,\" CEO Jeff Gennette said in a statement. \n\"Our primary focus in 2017 has been to continue the strong growth of digital and mobile, stabilize our brick & mortar business and set the foundation for future growth,\" he added. \"Looking ahead to 2018, we are focused on continuous improvement and will take the necessary steps to move faster, execute more effectively and allocate resources to invest in growth.\" \nIn confirming the 11 locations that will shutter this year, Macy's also said this path (along with other efforts) should save the company about $300 million in expenses annually, starting in fiscal 2018, which will be reinvested back in the business. Macy's said it will begin reducing employees in some locations, while adding in others, and will work to \"streamline\" certain operations completed outside of stores. \n\"A healthy store base combined with robust digital capabilities is Macy's recipe for success,\" Gennette said. More doors set to be closed \nAbout this same time last year, Macy's posted disappointing holiday sales and released the locations of more than 60 of the 100 stores it planned to close in 2017. The company also said at the time it would close 34 more stores \"over the next few years\" as leases or operating covenants expired or as sale transactions were completed (making 100 closures in total). \nOn Wednesday, reports began to surface that a handful of those 34 closures would take place in 2018, and the retailer's shares dropped nearly 4 percent on the news. On Thursday morning, Macy's confirmed that it's nearing completing 81 of the 100 planned store closures, with 19 more to take place over time. \nHaving faced pressure before from activist investor Starboard ( which sold its stake in the company in 2017 ) to separate its real estate from its retail business, Macy's has still been taking steps to make money from those assets. The department store chain now has a partnership with Brookefield Asset Management to explore opportunities on 50 properties. \n\"The company's announcements of further store closures and more cost-streaming underscore the need for more surgery to restore the business to health,\" GlobalData Retail's Saunders said. \"In our view, Macy's still has an enormous amount of work to do here.\" \nMeantime, Macy's is testing smaller versions of its off-price concept, Macy's Backstage, inside some of its existing stores, which appeals to customers looking for more of a \"treasure hunt\" shopping experience. Other efforts have focused on upgrading Macy's loyalty program and mobile app. \nAll in all, this holiday season was an important one for Macy's to prove its relevance in retail against a backdrop of declining revenues and negative same-store sales. \nIn late November, Gennette told CNBC Macy's was already looking to be a \"better destination with better experiences\" throughout the holiday season compared with the year prior. Top-selling items included coats, sweaters, boots (namely winter weather apparel) and fragrances, the company said. \nMeantime, promotions across stores were less severe, Gennette said, which should help boost the company's embattled profit margins in the long term. \n\"We're looking at new opportunities to bring traffic into stores,\" Gennette has said about initiatives in 2018. \"Customers love experiences when they come into the building.\" \nAs of Wednesday's close, Macy's shares have tumbled more than 25 percent over the past 12 months. The retailer's fourth-quarter earnings results are set to be announced Feb. 27. \nThe following Macy's stores are closing in early 2018. In most cases, clearance sales will begin on Jan. 8 and run for up to 12 weeks. \nLaguna Hills Mall, Laguna Hills, CaliforniaWestside Pavilion, Los Angeles"}

The dollar could end up losing out to the euro and yen if the U.S. proceeds with protectionist activity, and could ultimately be less attractive as a reserve currency, he said. Earlier, the dollar moved lower on a report that Chinese officials were considering buying fewer or stopping purchases of Treasury securities due to their unattractiveness but also trade issues. SHARES \nProtectionism may be a problem for the U.S. dollar. \nIf the U.S. pulls out of NAFTA, the Mexican peso could lose as much as another 10 percent, but the U.S. dollar could also get slammed against major world currencies, according to Jens Nordvig, CEO of Exante Data. Getty Images \nThe currency strategist said U.S. protectionism is one of the biggest threats to the dollar and one of the biggest sources of dollar volatility. \nReuters Wednesday quoted unnamed Canadian government officials saying they are increasingly convinced that President Donald Trump will withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. The next round of talks is scheduled for Jan. 23 in Canada. \nThe peso lost 0.9 percent, and the Canadian dollar fell one percent on the report. \nNordvig said the size of the Canadian dollar's decline is unusual, and the loonie has not previously reacted as intensely during prior NAFTA scares. If NAFTA fails, he said the Canadian dollar would decline further but not as much as the five to 10 percent decline he expects to see in the peso. \n\"Mexico is more vulnerable. Over time, we think the Mexican move is going to play out more forcefully. What the dollar does on a global scale is more tricky,\" said Nordvig. \nIf the 24 year old treaty is tossed, years of integration between Mexico, Canada and the U.S. will be at risk. Supporters of NAFTA claim prices will rise if the U.S. kills the trade deal, and the U.S. will find itself at the start of what could turn into trade wars. But critics of NAFTA say it has allowed U.S. manufacturing and workers to be undermined by low cost goods coming in from Mexico, which has a $60 billion trade deficit with the U.S. \n\"The dollar will suffer against the euro but the market is not really having a clear view on this. The euro is actually down on these headlines. The market is actually so confused about what it means for the global dollar,\" said Nordvig. \nEarlier Wednesday, the dollar sank on another trade related story. Bloomberg reported that unnamed Chinese officials were considering stopping purchases of U.S. Treasurys because of their unattractiveness but also trade issues. \nThe Trump administration is expected to make recommendations on steel and aluminum this month that could impact China. \nBut Nordvig said it would take a much bigger trade event than product tarriffs to really damage the dollar, and if the U.S. does engage in full scale protectionism, the dollar could ultimatley be seen as less attractive as a reserve currency. \nCanada, the U.S. and Mexico have held five rounds of talks to renegotiate NAFTA but U.S. demands on how trade issues are resolved and the treaty's permanence have been among the thorny issues for Canada and Mexico. \nEarlier Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer called a case filed by Canada with the World Trade Organization against the U.S. for U.S. disciplinary practices and procedures \"a broad and ill-advised attack\" on the U.S. trade remedies system. \n\"Even if Canada succeeded on these groundless claims, other countries would primarily benefit, not Canada. For example, if the U.S. removed the orders listed in Canada's complaint, the flood of imports from China and other countries would negatively impact billions of dollars in Canadian exports to the United States, including nearly $9 billion in exports of steel and aluminum products and more than $2.5 billion in exports of wood and paper products,\" the trade representative said in a statement.

He has a willing partner in House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who has long had an interest in the issue.\nBut some Republicans believe Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is lukewarm on the drive for revising welfare, which might face a difficult sell in the Senate where Republicans hold only a razor-thin 51-49 majority.\nDemocrats already are attacking Trump for identifying welfare changes as his top 2018 goal, saying they are designed to help pay for tax cuts whose benefits are skewed toward corporations and wealthy individuals and which will add an estimated $1.5 trillion to the debt over 10 years.\nTrump has summoned Republican congressional leaders to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland this weekend to discuss 2018 priorities, including welfare and a planned effort on infrastructure investment.\nConservative House Republicans are especially enthusiastic about a welfare overhaul. Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows and the caucus\u2019 former leader, U.S. Representative Jim Jordan, have discussed it with Trump and are confident the Republican president backs their ideas, such as strengthening work requirements for food stamps.\n\u201cHe definitely gets it,\u201d Jordan said.\nBut Republicans may need to tread carefully in seeking to reduce government aid programs that benefit some of Trump\u2019s core supporters in poor, rural regions of the country.\nRepublican Representative Tom Cole said Congress had a lot on its plate in the early months of 2018, including must-pass budget legislation and he was unsure there would be the time - or political will in the Senate - to pass welfare legislation.\n\u201cFirst things first,\u201d Cole said, adding it might be better to lay the groundwork for debate over the issue than to try enacting changes this year.\nMeadows said he believed a welfare overhaul had strong support among Republican lawmakers but that \u201cconvincing Mitch McConnell and the Democrats are Herculean tasks.\u201d\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump arrives with Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan prior to celebrating with Congressional Republicans after the U.S. Congress passed sweeping tax overhaul legislation on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., December 20, 2017. REUTERS\/Carlos Barria\/File Photo Other Republicans and interest groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers think 2018 would be better spent on infrastructure.\nTOUGHER THAN TAXES? Trump\u2019s first major legislative victory - the tax bill - took until the end of 2017. But handing out tax breaks might be far easier than revamping welfare assistance that benefits millions of American families.\nLast year, there were more than 42 million people in nearly 21 million U.S. households receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits, which are known as food stamps, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump celebrates with Congressional Republicans after the U.S. Congress passed sweeping tax overhaul legislation, on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., December 20, 2017. REUTERS\/Carlos Barria\/File Photo They cost taxpayers about $58 billion.\nTrump\u2019s budget proposal last year called for cutting more than $192 billion from SNAP over a decade.\nThe president also proposed deep cuts to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which last year provided aid to 1.1 million families.\nDemocratic strategist Doug Thornell said a push on welfare could trigger a political backlash for Republicans from elderly and blue-collar voters in the November congressional elections.\nThornell said it may appeal to Trump\u2019s political base \u201cbut few else. And the irony here is that it will be Trump\u2019s base who will feel the brunt of these cuts.\u201d\nRobert Doar, a poverty specialist at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute who has been in contact with Trump administration officials about policy ideas, urged an incremental approach.\nAlthough Doar said he did not know what policies the administration would ultimately back, he said Trump could encourage people to get jobs by reducing the length of their qualification for government aid and imposing stricter reviews of their efforts to find work.\nHe said Congress could pass legislation cutting benefits for people who fail to make enough effort to find jobs or do volunteer work.\nSome have argued that food stamp beneficiaries, for example, already include a high rate of people who hold jobs but are unable to make ends meet.\nReporting by Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell; Additional reporting by James Oliphant and Steve Holland; Editing by Peter Cooney\n "}

In the process, she learned that, when we judge other people, it's often deeply personal and not about the other people at all. \"Whatever we resent or dislike in another person is a reflection of something we dislike in ourselves or a representation of a deep wound that we're unwilling to heal,\" she said.\nWhile judging others often feels natural and gives us a quick high, the hangover is painful. As Gabby puts it, \"Judgment lowers our energy and weakens us physically and mentally. It makes us feel alone and cut off from inspiration and love.\"\nSometimes, in order to remove judgment, we need to look at all of our fears and bring them to light.

In most cases, this belief only exists in our heads, yet it prevents us from moving forward with our lives. \"We play small, we attack back and we even turn to addictive behavior to anesthetize the feeling,\" she says.\nCommit to positive results Through her healing process, Gabby was determined to see change. \"My commitment to healing my own relationship to judgment has changed my life in profound ways,\" she says. Commitment helped her become a more mindful and conscious person and to let go of resentments and jealousies.\nNow, instead of being in pain, she has forgiven others and has a healthy relationship with judgment.\nBe generous \"Want for others what you want for yourself,\" says Gabby, and help others, in part because you end up being helped, too. We feel better about our own situation when we are generous with those around us, at work or at home.\n\"Celebrate the success of others and you will become a magnet for what you desire,\" she says. When you do someone a favor, people will see you more positively and you will feel good about yourself at the same time.\nUnfollow anyone who makes you unhappy \nThe more we compare our lives with others in our social media feeds, the more depressed we become. That's why Gabby recommends that we only follow people on social media that inspire us.

On Thursday he tried to elaborate on his position, noting that the administration still backs a strong dollar in the long term. \nHowever, the dollar fell against its global competitors both days, reaching a 12-month low Thursday, and is down more than 11 percent over the past 12 months. President Donald Trump himself has said that a weak dollar is preferable for the U.S. economy at this point. \nDalio, who runs the largest hedge fund in the world with $150 billion in assets, was not alone in his criticisms. Banking analyst Dick Bove of the Vertical Group also said Mnuchin's comments threaten to unravel the economic recovery. \nInterestingly, Moody's Investors Service said the dollar's longer trajectory could be higher, despite the dive this week. \n\"We expect to see dollar volatility as U.S. policy discussions progress, but overall for 2018 we expect the U.S .dollar to strengthen slightly given the continued tightening of US monetary policy,\" said Elena Duggar, associate managing director at Moody's. \nWATCH: Mnuchin not worried about the dollar . show chapters"}

However, the divergence between growth in sales of food and non-food has never been so stark,\u201d BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.\nNon-food sales fell by 1.4 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, the biggest drop since March 2009, while food sales grew by 4.2 percent, the biggest jump since June.\nVisa said on Monday that a broader measure of consumer spending fell in December for the first time since 2012.\nThe BRC said clothing sales did better last month than a year earlier, helped by colder-than-normal weather, while jewelry and toys underperformed compared with the year before.\nThis partly mirrors trading statements from major retailers. Next ( NXT.L ), the country\u2019s biggest clothing store, and discount food retailer Aldi UK reported strong sales, but department store Debenhams ( DEB.L ) cut profit forecasts.\nBritish retail sales data has become harder to interpret in the past couple of years due to signs that some spending may be shifting earlier in the festive period to take advantage of Black Friday discounts in late November.\nBritain\u2019s biggest credit card provider, Barclaycard ( BARC.L ), said consumer spending between Nov. 19 and Dec. 23 was 4.0 percent higher than a year earlier, the sharpest rise in eight months. This period covered Black Friday, and Barclaycard also includes spending at places like hotels, pubs and restaurants, which is growing much faster than retail spending.\nBy contrast, the BRC said retail spending in the Nov. 26-Dec. 30 period was up just 1.4 percent on a year earlier, and only rose by 0.6 percent when changes in shop floor space are adjusted for.\nReporting by David Milliken, editing by Andy Bruce\n "}

They have presented a united front and vested their representatives in Brussels with the authority to negotiate with London. \nHammond sought to hammer home his message in a speech he was due to give later on Wednesday in Berlin. \n\u201cThey say \u2018it takes two to tango\u2019: both sides need to be clear about what they want from a future relationship,\u201d Hammond said, according to excerpts of the speech. Britain's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis arrives in Downing Street, London, Britain, December 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Toby Melville \n\u201cI know the repeated complaint from Brussels has been that the UK \u2018hasn\u2019t made up its mind what type of relationship it wants,'\u201d he said. \u201cBut in London, many feel that we have little, if any, signal of what future relationship the EU27 would like to have with a post-Brexit Britain.\u201d \nThe bloc\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said on Tuesday the EU would not give financial firms based in Britain a general \u201cpassport\u201d to do business in the single market, as many in the City of London had been hoping it would. \nLondon\u2019s place as Europe\u2019s financial services centre is one of Britain\u2019s main assets, and Hammond and Davis are likely to stress during their visit the importance to German firms of access to those services as well as the major presence of Deutsche Bank in London. \n\u201cWe must re-double our collective effort to ensure that we do not put that hard-earned financial stability at risk, by getting a deal that supports collaboration within the European banking sector, rather than forcing it to fragment,\u201d they wrote in their joint article. \nIn December, the Bank of England said it would spare European banks costly capital rules after Brexit but warned of \u201cconsequences\u201d if negotiations with Brussels turned sour. \nHammond and Davis also called for Britain and EU countries to retain access to each other\u2019s markets under current rules during a transition period between exit day on March 29, 2019, and whenever a final settlement is enacted. \nThey reiterated Britain would leave the European customs union and single market when it left the EU. But they argued that in building a new relationship negotiators should not restrict themselves to models that already exist.

{"published":"2018-01-17T22:20:00.000+02:00","title":"An immigration deal in DC needs E-Verify to really work","text":"A ray of hope is emerging in the D.C. immigration battles.\nFirst, the Arizona Republic newspaper says the so-called \"Gang of Six\" senators led by Arizona Republican Jeff Flake have made a new immigration deal offer that includes eliminating the Diversity Visa Lottery program and allocating $18 billion in additional border security with an immediate $1.6 billion in funding for the new border wall.\nThat's closer to a deal President Donald Trump could and should sign.\nThe second ray of hope comes from an unexpected source. The usually 100 percent anti-amnesty NumbersUSA organization announced support for the most of the details in the new Gang of Six offer provided it adds a provision to make E-Verify mandatory for all U.S. employers .\nE-Verify is the federal database that allows employers to check and confirm the status of potential employees. It's also the one thing that would make winners of not just the \"Dreamer\" children of illegal immigrants, but Democrats, congressional Republicans, and the White House too.\nHere's how:\nFirst off, the American people support the idea. An ABC News Washington Post poll showed that 79 percent of respondents support requiring employers to verify immigration status. But as of now, the Society for Human Resource Management says fewer than 10 percent of U.S. employers are using the E-Verify system. So, this is something where a noticeable difference can be made in a hurry.\nDreamers will win with E-Verify because it will provide the most economically tangible benefit of their hard-won legal status.\nRepublicans win with E-Verify as it gives them cover for approving amnesty for the Dreamers with the hard right base. If NumbersUSA is okay with it, it's not likely any significant numbers of GOP voters will object.\nAvoiding any pushback for helping the Dreamers is a big plus for the Republicans as they need to heed poll after poll that shows strong support for those children and young adults. The added plus for the GOP is that pushing for E-Verify will prove they're not the slaves of their service industry corporate donors. Left-leaning critics have long criticized the GOP for allegedly helping big business use illegal immigration to keep wages low.\nOf course, the harder case to make is proving that backing E-Verify is a good move for the Democrats. Here are two key reasons it is.\nFirst, it would be one of the first things Democrats have done to show they're actually learning a valuable lesson from the 2016 election results. The fact is, a crucial part of their voting base likely supports E-Verify and all the ideas behind it. Rank-and-file union members have long suspected that illegal immigrants hurt their wages and employment prospects.\nThat suspicion is a key reason why Trump did so well among those rank-and-file union voters in 2016. Union leadership may not officially support E-Verify, but even AFL-CIO chief Richard Trumka praised President Trump last year for mentioning the effect illegal immigration has on wages.\nIf the Democrats want to win back those union voters, supporting E-Verify is a great way to do it. The party can continue to waste time trying to blame Hillary Clinton 's loss on Russian collusion, but they lost to Trump in 2016 mostly because they failed to win blue collar union states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Backing E-Verify is a way to get them back.\nSecond, the Democrats also have polls to worry about that make supporting E-Verify a good move. It's true most voters support the Dreamers and generally don't like the idea of mass deportations, but it's also true that voters support the rule of law. A recent survey that shows that 80 percent of voters oppose the idea of sanctuary cities proves that point. Democrats ignore that sentiment to their great peril.\nMost importantly, E-Verify gives us the lowest cost tool to reduce illegal border crossings in the first place. That's because the lure of potential jobs is just as much of an incentive to cross the border as lax security.\nWe learned that when illegal immigration fell off significantly in the Great Recession years of 2007 to 2009. By contrast, the noticeable uptick in the U.S. economy this year has actually encouraged a spike in illegal southern border crossing that began this summer and is continuing even now.\nWe can keep spending billions on new border walls, ICE raids, and detention centers. Or we can implement a popular program like E-Verify and get the same results at a small fraction of the cost.\nIt's not often that a far-right or far-left group adds any real hope to a policy debate in Washington. But the push for E-Verify is a win\/win\/win for the left, right, and everyone in between.\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

FILE PHOTO: The European Central Bank (ECB) headquarters are pictured in Frankfurt, Germany, December 7, 2017. REUTERS\/Ralph Orlowski\/File Photo \nWhen the ECB said it would halve monthly bond purchases to 30 billion euros ($36 billion) from Jan. 1 but keep the scheme until Sept. 30, there was an expectation its asset buying would only be wound down gradually thereafter over a period of months. \nGiven the ECB has said rates would remain unchanged until \u201cwell past\u201d the program had ended once and for all, many investors assumed interest rates would stay on hold at least until late 2019. \nBut in the past two weeks, some ECB officials have suggested the 2.55 trillion euro asset-purchase program could end altogether in September - potentially bringing forward the timing of the bank\u2019s first rate rise since 2011. \nAccording to money market pricing EUROIS, investors have brought forward expectations of an increase by about six months to early 2019, suggesting a rate rise could come well before Mario Draghi\u2019s term as ECB chief ends in October next year. \nYields on short-dated bonds, the most sensitive to changes in interest rates, have also started to move higher, indicating that expectations of tighter monetary policy are starting to outweigh the impact of so-called quantitative easing (QE). \nFive-year bond yields in Germany, the euro zone\u2019s biggest economy, rose 10 basis points in December DE5YT=RR, the biggest monthly jump in six. Two-year German bond yields are near five-month highs at minus 0.62 percent DE2YT=RR while 10-year bond yields hit two-month highs last week DE10YT=RR. \n\u201cRight now long-term rates are determined by the timing of a first rate hike rather than the flow of QE,\u201d said Peter Chatwell, head of rates strategy at Mizuho in London. ANTICIPATING THE END \nAt the start of December, euro zone government bond yields were near multi-month lows, even though some asset managers said they should be higher given the reduction in bond buying to come and the risk of tighter monetary policy. \nAnalysts say the market shift came after comments from the ECB\u2019s Benoit Coeure and Ewald Nowotny. Coeure, the man in charge of the bank\u2019s asset-buying program, said on Dec. 30 there was a reasonable chance it would not be extended. \nNowotny said in an interview published on Jan. 2 that QE could end in 2018 if the euro zone economy continues to grow strongly and on Sunday, the Bundesbank\u2019s Jens Weidmann said the ECB should set a date to end QE. \nThe ECB\u2019s \u201cforward guidance\u201d on rates staying low for the foreseeable future has been credited with capping medium-term borrowing costs for governments and firms alike and is one policy tool the bank can use after QE ends. \nBut that guidance, and its ability to anchor borrowing costs, could be put to the test if the euro zone economy continues its strong expansion, inflation creeps up and markets sense a rate rise may be coming sooner rather than later. \nCentral bankers know that preparing the ground for a withdrawal of stimulus is crucial. In May 2013, then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke sent global bond markets into a tailspin by suggesting the U.S. central bank\u2019s bond buying could be reduced - an event known as the \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d. \n\u201cRate hikes are not a 2018 story but even the mention of that means that markets are very unprepared,\u201d said Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy for EMEA at State Street Global Markets. \n\u201cMarkets are going to be increasingly watching any signs of when rates may rise beyond the tapering news flow which has broadly been factored in,\u201d he said. CORE INFLATION \nMoney market prices suggests investors have in recent weeks bought forward their expectations for the first rate rise by about six months, closer to March 2019. \nThe difference between the overnight bank-to-bank interest rate for the euro zone (Eonia) and forward Eonia rates is about 5 to 6 basis points in 18 months\u2019 time. \nAnalysts say that means investors are pricing in a 50-60 percent chance of a 10 bps increase in the ECB\u2019s deposit rate - the minimum it is likely to increase - from minus 0.4 percent. \nING senior bond analyst Martin van Vliet said the earliest occasion for the ECB to provide some clarity on the outlook for interest would be June, given it only announced the reduction to its QE program in October. \n\u201cIt is definitely going to be a year where the QE premium is priced out,\u201d he said. \nThe switch in focus to the timing of an ECB rate rise also means inflation data could have a greater impact on markets than in recent years, analysts said. \nInflation in the euro zone remains stubbornly low at 1.4 percent - or just 1.1 percent when volatile food and energy prices are stripped out - well below the ECB\u2019s target of an inflation rate of nearly 2 percent. \nYet purchasing managers surveys showed that the euro zone economy ended 2017 with its strongest growth in seven years, driven by accelerating services and manufacturing activity across all major economies. \n\u201cThis year will be all about core inflation, core inflation, core inflation,\u201d said Frederik Ducrozet, senior economist at Pictet Wealth Management in Geneva. \n($1 = 0.8356 euros)"}

It had great year last year,\" told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Tuesday. \"Commodities had a miserable year. History says commodities will outperform equities this year.\" \nCurrie went so far as to disagree with Goldman's ranking of asset classes for 2018, which places stocks above commodities. \n\"History says it's commodities, equities, bonds and cash,\" he said. \nCurrie's outlook for commodities boils down to three R's: reflation, reconvergence of global growth and releveraging. In other words, inflation is expected to rise, global economies are growing in unison and the world is borrowing more money. \n\"You put those three together, they create a really strong macro backdrop \u2014 the best, again, we've seen since maybe 2004,\" Currie said. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Jeff Currie \nThere's also a benefit to buying and holding a broad range of commodities, known as positive carry, for the first time in years, Currie said. He noted there's currently positive carry for all the commodities in the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index. \nAsked how long the bull cycle for commodities has to run, Currie says investors need to split the market into metals and energy. \nThe metals sector has experienced more than seven years of under-investment in new production of copper and other core metals, he said. Goldman expects copper to average $7,050 per ton in the final quarter of 2018, up from $6,750 in the year-ago period. \n\"It has a similar supply story as what we saw back in the 2000s,\" Currie said, referring to the start of an historic super cycle in commodities driven by Chinese economic growth. \"Then overlay that demand story on it, you have a lot of potential price upside in the base metals complex.\" \nOn the other hand, Currie believes the long-term story for energy can't be as good. That's because new technology like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling allow producers to tap vast reserves of oil and natural gas, creating the risk of oversupply that will weigh on prices."}

REUTERS\/Mary F. Calvert President Donald Trump is expected to announce a \u201cwhole of government\u201d approach that will also ease export rules on U.S. military exports and give greater weight to the economic benefits for American manufacturers in a decision-making process that has long focused heavily on human rights considerations, according to people familiar with the plan.\nThe initiative, which will encompass everything from fighter jets and drones to warships and artillery, is expected to be launched as early as February, senior officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\nA key policy change would call for embassy staffers around the world to act essentially as a sales force for defense contractors, actively advocating on their behalf. It was unclear, however, what specific guidelines would be established.\nBut under this more proactive approach, embassy staffers would engage more aggressively with foreign counterparts to push for U.S. arms sales and brief visiting senior U.S. officials so they can help advance pending deals, according to a person familiar with the matter. One senior administration official described the proposal as a \u201c180-degree shift\u201d in the current arms-length approach to foreign weapons sales.\nTrump is seeking to fulfill a 2016 election campaign promise to create jobs in the United States by selling more goods and services abroad to bring down the U.S. trade deficit from a six-year high of $50 billion.\nThe administration is also under pressure from U.S. defense contractors facing growing competition from foreign rivals such as China and Russia. But any loosening of the restrictions on weapons sales would be in defiance of human rights and arms control advocates who said there was too great a risk of fueling violence in regions such as the Middle East and South Asia or arms being diverted to be used in terrorist attacks.\nARMS REGULATIONS Besides greater use of a network of military and commercial attaches already stationed at U.S. embassies in foreign capitals, senior officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said another thrust of the plan will be to set in motion a realignment of the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR). It is a central policy governing arms exports since 1976 and has not been fully revamped in more than three decades.\nThis expanded government effort on behalf of American arms makers, together with looser restrictions on weapons exports and more favorable treatment of sales to non-NATO allies and partners, could bring additional billions of dollars in deals and more jobs, the senior U.S. official said, without providing specifics.\nThe strategy of having the Pentagon and the U.S. State Department take a more active role in securing foreign arms deals could especially benefit major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin ( LMT.N ) and Boeing Co ( BA.N ).\n\u201cWe want to see those guys, the commercial and military attaches, unfettered to be salesmen for this stuff, to be promoters,\u201d said the senior administration official, who is close to the internal deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nA State Department official, asked to confirm details of the coming new policy, said the revamped approach \u201cgives our partners a greater capacity to help share the burden of international security, benefits the defense industrial base and will provide more good jobs for American workers.\u201d\nThe White House and Pentagon declined official comment.\nDefense industry officials and lobbyists have privately welcomed what they expect will be a more sales-friendly approach.\nTrump, a Republican, has the legal authority to direct government embassy \u201csecurity assistance officers,\u201d both military personnel and civilians, to do more to help drive arms sales.\nAdministration officials see this group, which until now has had more limited duties such as helping to manage U.S. military aid overseas and providing some information to foreign governments for buying U.S. arms, as underutilized by previous presidents.\nGraphic on U.S. arms sales: tmsnrt.rs\/2CZkZMB\n\u2018BACK SEAT\u2019 FOR HUMAN RIGHTS?\nOne national security analyst said that easing export restrictions to allow defense contractors to reap greater profits internationally would increase the danger of top-of-the-line U.S. weapons going to governments with poor human rights records or being used by militants.\n\u201cThis administration has demonstrated from the very beginning that human rights have taken a back seat to economic concerns,\u201d said Rachel Stohl, director of the conventional defense program at the Stimson Center in Washington. \u201cAnd the short-sightedness of a new arms export policy could have serious long-term implications.\u201d The administration officials said human rights and regional security concerns would remain part of the formula for arms sales decisions. But they said such reviews would now afford greater weight than before to whether a deal would be good for the U.S. economy and strengthen America\u2019s defense industrial base, in which case red tape would be cut accordingly. Rules to make it easier to sell U.S.-made military drones overseas and compete against fast-growing Chinese and Israeli rivals are also expected to be in the Trump plan, officials said.\nTrump\u2019s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also sought to make it easier to sell to America\u2019s most trusted allies but in a more cautious approach that his administration billed as a way to boost American business while keeping strict controls against more dangerous arms proliferation.

The pilot, Gareth Morgan, 44, also died. \nCousins had been due to retire on March 31. \nCompass said the new chief executive, Dominic Blakemore, would now start on Jan. 1 instead of April 1 as originally planned. \nCompass, with annual turnover of almost 23 billion pounds, employs around 550,000 people around the world providing food services to schools, the armed forces and office workers. \nBlakemore, who has worked at Compass since 2012 with roles as both finance director and head of the group\u2019s European operations, has a background in accounting. He has also held senior financial roles at British food groups Cadbury and Birds Eye Iglo. \nCompass Chairman Paul Walsh said in a statement: \u201cThe thoughts of everyone at Compass are with Richard\u2019s family and friends, and we extend our deepest sympathies to them.\u201d \n\u201cRichard was known and respected for his great humanity and a no-nonsense style that transformed Compass into one of Britain\u2019s leading companies,\u201d he added. \nCousins led Compass over the past 11 years.

Justin Sullivan Getty Images By Reuters 11:02 PM EST \nSouth Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor (hymtf) and Kia Motors (kimtf) on Tuesday flagged only modest sales growth in 2018, suggesting a slow recovery from a slump linked to their lack of SUVs in the United States and diplomatic tensions with China. \nHyundai and smaller affiliate Kia, which together make the world\u2019s fifth-largest automaker, said demand was expected to soften in the U.S. and Chinese markets as they unveiled a combined sales target of 7.55 million vehicles this year. \nAnalysts said that would be a slight increase on 2017, when the automakers are estimated to have sold about 7.3 million vehicles, their lowest in five years. \n\u201cThe target for Hyundai and Kia is lower than expected. It seems to be a conservative target, reflecting a slow recovery in China and ongoing U.S difficulties,\u201d Kim Jin-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities said. \nThe 2017 sales figures are due out later on Tuesday but analysts expect the South Korean duo to fall well short of their target of 8.25 million vehicles, marking their third consecutive annual miss. \nHyundai Motor shares declined 2.2 percent after falling as much as 4.5 percent on Tuesday morning, and Kia Motors stocks were down more than 1.6 percent. The broader market rose 0.2 percent. \nThe firms\u2019 sales tumbled last year in China, the world\u2019s largest auto market, amid a chill between Beijing and Seoul over South Korea\u2019s deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system. \nSales in China and the United States were also hurt by a failure to capitalise on surging demand for sports utility vehicles (SUVs). \nWhile Hyundai Motor has plans to offer more SUVs in the United States and China, analysts said new models such as the redesigned Santa Fe SUV may come too late in the year to significantly impact sales. \nThe expiration of a tax cut on small-engine cars in China also would be a negative for Hyundai\u2019s sedan-heavy line-up, they said. \nHyundai Motor Group Chairman Chung Mon-koo said in a statement the South Korean automakers would launch 12 new or refreshed models this year. \nFor more on Hyundai and Kia, see Fortune\u2019s video: \nThey would \u201cactively venture into\u201d new markets like Southeast Asia, as protectionism was expected to grow elsewhere, he added. \nSouth Korea and the United States will hold talks on a trade deal on Jan. 5 although U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the pact. \nChung, 79, skipped his annual New Year speech to employees for a second year in a row.

Atta Mohammad Noor, Governor of the Balkh province, gestures as he speaks during an interview in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan January 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Anil Usyan \nNoor, a leader in the Jamiat-i Islami party and governor of the strategic province of Balkh, is defying Ghani, denouncing the \u201cweak, lazy and corrupt\u201d Kabul government in daily rallies with thousands of supporters and warning the government against trying to remove him by force. \nThe deadlock, which has alarmed Western embassies and sparked fears of civil violence, has highlighted a fractious political climate that threatens to undermine recent battlefield successes from the sharp increase in U.S. air strikes last year. \nNoor accuses Ghani of trying to remove a potential rival and divide Jamiat ahead of a presidential election likely to be shaped by the ethnic faultlines that dominate Afghan politics, notably between Pashtuns and Persian-speaking Tajiks. \n\u201cThis is about the 2019 presidential election,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview at his office in the provincial capital Mazar-i Sharif, where his portrait adorns streets and buildings across the city. \u201cThey have no grassroots support among the people and they are afraid of public figures who do.\u201d \nGhani has not explained an announcement last month that he had accepted a letter of resignation from Noor, signed earlier last year during negotiations over a possible national role for the governor who has ruled Balkh for more than a decade. \nBut Noor says the letter, which has not been made public, was conditional on steps that Ghani has not taken and has refused to go. \nGhani has not said anything publicly about the stand-off. His spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment. \nNoor, a former commander in the anti-Soviet Mujahiddin considered one of the richest men in Afghanistan, has faced repeated accusations of corruption, which he denies. In 2015 Human Rights Watch said there was \u201cstrong evidence that he controls and funds local militias implicated in serious abuse\u201d. \nBut Balkh, which sits on vital trade routes into central Asia, is also one of Afghanistan\u2019s most stable and prosperous provinces, with a much smaller Taliban and Islamic State presence than in other northern regions. \nNoor enjoys strong support, notably from a business community that has done well out of the lucrative transit trade through Hairatan, the border crossing into Uzbekistan that handles hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods a year. \n\u201cPeople have been very unhappy about the problems between the president and the governor,\u201d said Khairuddin Mayel, who runs a large cooking oil and foods business. \u201cThe governor has been very successful and people don\u2019t want this province to become like the others.

REUTERS\/Anil Usyan \nAs the stand-off in Balkh has continued it has become a national issue, with Noor now demanding wider concessions, including what Jamiat sees as proper implementation of the accord underpinning Ghani\u2019s national unity government. \nLike many of the political problems of the past three years, the crisis stems from the fraud-marred presidential election in 2014 that left no agreed winner. \nUnder a U.S.-brokered deal, Ghani, an ethnic Pashtun, was appointed president while his rival Abdullah Abdullah, from Jamiat, was given the specially created post of chief executive. \nEver since, Jamiat supporters have bitterly resented what they see as Ghani\u2019s betrayal of the deal and favouritism toward Pashtuns, traditionally the strongest group in Afghan politics. Atta Mohammad Noor, Governor of the Balkh province, poses for a photo before an interview in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan January 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Anil Usyan \nWhile Noor has been angry with Ghani, he has also been incensed by Abdullah, his long-time party rival, whom he describes as a \u201csnake\u201d. \n\u201cJamiat will never trust Dr Abdullah,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has shown he is weak and a partner in the incompetence and crimes of the government.\u201d \nAbdullah has confirmed he had approved the decision to oust the governor, but has had little to say about Noor\u2019s reaction. \nThe dispute has also highlighted the role of a clutch of regional leaders, of whom Noor is one of the most prominent, whose strong local support have made them difficult for the central government to control. \nOver recent months, Ghani has sidelined several of them, forcing ethnic Uzbek vice-President Rashid Dostum into exile following a torture scandal. \nHe has also clashed with General Abdul Raziq, a powerful police commander whose successes against the Taliban in the southern province of Kandahar have given him a growing national profile. \nIn June, Noor joined Dostum, currently in Turkey, in forming a \u201cCoalition for the Salvation of Afghanistan\u201d, uniting figures from the Tajik, Hazara and Uzbek communities. Pictures of the two, together with Hazara leader Mohammad Mohaqiq, are on prominent display in Mazar. \nNoor said they, and other regional leaders, represented a reality that could not be ignored. \n\u201cWe have powerful political parties, influential figures, those who have grassroots support among the people,\u201d said Noor. \u201cThey will remain in Afghanistan and will fight against terrorism as they fought in the past.\u201d Additional reporting by Mirwais Harooni in KABUL; Editing by Alex Richardson"}

I think they're making a huge mistake,\" Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy, told CNBC's \" Trading Nation \" on Tuesday. \"They're basically betting on the fact that high expensive products can be sold at this point and it's clearly becoming evident that everybody has caught up to them in the marketplace.\"\nSchlossberg's concerns over Apple pricing resurfaced ahead of the launch of its Siri-connected artificial-intelligence home device, the HomePod. With a $349 price tag, its latest product is far more expensive than its major competitors, including Amazon's Alexa-equipped Echo or Google's Home Mini.\n\"Nobody is going to buy it at the price that they're putting it out right now because the functionality of those products is just nowhere near as great as it needs to be relative to the price difference,\" said Schlossberg.\nWorries over softening iPhone sales have also spread among a number of analyst firms. J.P. Morgan estimates a 50 percent quarter-on-quarter drop in sales of its high-end iPhone X, while Atlantic Equities downgraded its rating to neutral from overweight on signs of weaker iPhone demand.\nMax Wolff , chief economist at The Phoenix Group, is cognizant of weaker iPhone sales trends but does not expect those issues to come into focus as soon as this quarter. Instead, he sees Apple still in a position of strength.\n\"They command a high price. They're sitting on a ton of cash. The tax breaks help them,\" he said. \"I don't think they're a bad bet for the next couple of quarters, certainly not this one, but there are some storm clouds on the horizon for sure.\"\nAnalysts generally expect an upbeat quarter for Apple with quarterly adjusted earnings and sales both rising by 11 percent. Sales of the iPhone, the best-selling Apple product and its largest topline contributor, are forecast to climb by 10 percent. Apple has come in above analysts' consensus in the past six quarters. The company is due to report its fiscal first quarter on Feb. 1.\nReports of weaker iPhone demand have roiled Apple's stock price this week.

Courtesy ExxonMobil Canada\/Handout via REUTERS\/Files \nExxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and their peers are set to cut spending on oil and gas exploration for a fifth year in a row in 2018, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie (WoodMac), despite a growing urgency to replenish reserves after years of reining back investment. \nGlobal investment in exploration, vital to increase output and offset the natural decline of existing fields, will reach $37 billion in 2018, down 7 percent from a year earlier and over 60 percent below the 2014 peak, according to WoodMac. \nFor majors, spending will collectively drop by around 4 percent this year to represent about a tenth of investment in oil and gas production, known as upstream. \n\u201cThis could be the new normal, with the days of one dollar in six or seven going to exploration forever in the past,\u201d WoodMac said in a report. \nThe declines, however, mask a modest uptick in drilling activity as lower rig rates and a focused approach on well-charted basins allow firms to do more with their money, according to WoodMac analyst Andrew Latham. \n\u201cInvestment will be down year-on year but activity will be flat to slightly higher,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview. The first Mobil gas station is pictured in Queretaro, Mexico December 8, 2017.

But access to a more widely used messaging app, Telegram, remained blocked, suggesting authorities remained uneasy about protest threats. \nIn the latest protests, which generally occur after nightfall, social media video showed demonstrators in Khorramabad in southwestern Iran on Wednesday evening throwing stones at riot police, who were retreating. \nIn other social media footage, hundreds poured into streets of the northwestern city of Orumiyeh near the Turkish border, chanting anti-government slogans. \nNone of the videos could be authenticated by Reuters. \nThe student news agency ISNA quoted Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli as saying on Thursday that \u201cat most 42,000 people attended the protests, which is not much\u201d in a nation of 80 million people. \nOn Wednesday, the commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said the number of \u201ctroublemakers\u201d did not exceed 15,000 nationwide. \nNikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said earlier this week Washington was seeking emergency sessions on Iran\u2019s turmoil at the U.N. Security Council in New York and the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. \nRussia rejected the idea on Thursday, with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov calling it \u201charmful and destructive\u201d, according to RIA news agency. \n\u201dIran\u2019s domestic affairs have nothing to do with the U.N. Security Council\u2019s role, (which is the) \u201cmaintenance of international peace and security,\u201d he said. \n(Map of protests in Iran - tmsnrt.rs\/2CGK4eQ ) RARE ANTI-GOVERNMENT OUTBURSTS Opponents of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani hold a protest outside the Iranian embassy in west London, Britain December 31, 2017. REUTERS\/Eddie Keogh \nAs unrest spread across Iran, mainly in smaller cities and towns, protesters said they were tired of official anti-Western rhetoric and it was time for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the government of President Hassan Rouhani to quit. \n\u201dI voted for Khatami and Rouhani, hoping for change. Hoping for freedom. Hoping to live like a normal human being. But nothing has changed,\u201d said Maryam Azemi, 48, a mother of two in the city of Karaj near Tehran. \n\u201dI don\u2019t trust anyone anymore. We waited so long for change in this country. We tried peaceful ways to bring change, like voting, but look at us now. The officials are competing with each other to rip us off.\u201d \nProtests have drawn largely young people and workers but have begun to take in members of the educated middle class that formed the backbone of a pro-reform revolt almost a decade ago. \nAfter six days of demonstrations, Jafari said on Wednesday that Revolutionary Guards units had been deployed to put down protests in three provinces that have been hotbeds of unrest. That was the clearest sign yet that authorities were taking the protests seriously. \nThe Revolutionary Guards, the sword and shield of Iran\u2019s Shi\u2018ite theocracy, were instrumental in suppressing an uprising over alleged election fraud in 2009 in which dozens were killed. STATE-SPONSORED COUNTER-DEMONSTRATIONS \nState television broadcast live pictures of further pro-government rallies on Thursday, including Ghaemshahr in northern Iran and Mashhad in the northeast, as well as Shahin Shahr in central Iran. Marchers carried posters saying, \u201cNo to riots,\u201d and \u201cDeath to seditionists\u201d, as well as portraits of Khamenei. \nState media said three Iranian security agents were killed on Wednesday near the Iraqi border in a clash that led to the dismantling of a team of \u201ccounter-revolutionaries\u201d who had planned to cause explosions and provoke unrest. \nThe intelligence ministry said several \u201cterrorists\u201d were killed in the clash and one was arrested. Kurdish rebels are known to be active in the area. \nFew believe the protests pose an existential threat to the clerical elite, backed by pervasive security services, that has dominated Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that overthrew a U.S.-backed monarchy. \nBut protesters have become increasingly bold in challenging Khamenei, who blamed the most sustained challenge to his 29 years in power for nearly a decade on \u201cseditionists\u201d and foreign agents. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to harm my country but when I see those who run this country are so corrupt, I feel like I am being suffocated. They just talk. They accuse \u2018the enemies\u2019 of everything,\u201d said protester Reza, 43, a father of three in the central city of Isfahan. \n\u201cI am not an enemy. I am an Iranian.

Complete is expected to generate approximately $17.0 million of revenues in 2018.\nAlso, on December 29, 2017, Casella acquired the commercial and residential collection assets from a hauler in Vermont for a total consideration of up to $1.8 million.\n\u201cIn early August 2017, we announced to the market our updated long-term strategic plan through 2021,\u201d said John W. Casella, Chairman and CEO of Casella Waste Systems. \u201cAs part of this new 2021 plan, and as a result of the recent success of our focus on reducing risk and improving our balance sheet, we are now able to begin to use our capital in a manner that balances continued delevering with smart acquisition and development growth.\u201d\n\u201cWe have set a goal of $20.0 million to $40.0 million per year of acquisition or development activity as part of this new strategy,\u201d Casella said. \u201cWe believe that the acquisition of Complete and of this most-recent small tuck-in acquisition puts us on track to meet our acquisition target in 2018.\u201d\n\u201cAs we have laid out over the last several quarters, given the continued tightening of the disposal markets across the northeast due to permanent facility closures and increased economic activity, coupled with changes in the recycling markets, we believe that we have an excellent opportunity to acquire select assets across our market areas,\u201d Casella said. \u201cWe expect that investing a portion of our excess cash flows to grow our business will create additional shareholder returns through higher cash flow growth rates driven by new revenue streams, internalization to our disposal facilities and cost synergies.\u201d\n\u201cThe Complete team has built an exceptional solid waste company that is well regarded by its customers,\u201d Casella said. \u201cIn addition, this acquisition is a great strategic fit with our operations and long-term plan. With this acquisition, we are entering a new adjacent market in Western Massachusetts, enhancing our construction & demolition capabilities with a state-of-the-art processing facility, and adding rail and truck transfer capabilities in the Western Massachusetts marketplace that will see another 0.8 million tons of landfill capacity permanently close in 2018. We expect to begin to internalize volumes from this market to our Western New York landfills that have excess annual capacity during 2018.\u201d\nAbout Casella Waste Systems, Inc.\nCasella Waste Systems, Inc., headquartered in Rutland, Vermont, provides solid waste management services consisting of collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling services in the northeastern United States.

The firm also announced the expansion of its senior leadership team and its unique approach to maximizing transaction value and liquidity prospects for private shareholders.\nOver the last several quarters, ICR Capital\u2019s senior team has delivered advisory services for the following transactions with numerous other mandates under contract:\nIPO Advisory \u2013 Altair Engineering, Alteryx, Appian, Bandwidth, Camping World Holdings, CarGurus, FAT Brands, Funko, Inc., MongoDB, MuleSoft, SailPoint, and Yext Follow-on Offerings \u2013 Alteryx, Appian and Everbridge\nMore generally, ICR has worked on roughly 300 IPOs over the last 10 years, establishing strong market leadership with respect to preparing private companies for their transition to life as a public company. This experience spans numerous industry groups including technology, consumer, healthcare, financial services, business services, energy, real estate, and industrials among others.\nICR Capital\u2019s senior leadership team includes David Galper, CEO, who has originated more than 75 equity offerings, M&A advisory mandates and leveraged finance transactions across a wide range of industries during his career. He formerly served as a founding member of the Equity Capital Markets Execution Group at Lehman Brothers. Adding to the depth of the senior leadership team is Tim Dolan, a seasoned capital markets professional with firms such as Alex. Brown & Sons and Deutsche Bank prior to his 14 years with ICR. Tim has been appointed Vice Chairman of ICR Capital and has served as a senior advisor on over 100 technology, media and telecom IPOs.\nICR Capital\u2019s senior team also includes sector experts such as Scott Van Winkle in food, beverage and healthy living and Evelyn Infurna in REITs and financial services. ICR Capital is the only transaction advisor where industry-focused transaction teams integrate with sector experts in investor relations, public relations, crises management, digital branding, video production and social media.\nDavid Galper, CEO of ICR Capital stated, \u201cWhile ICR has always been the leading advisor to private companies entering the IPO process, we formally productized our offering with the launch of ICR Capital in late 2015. We have seen significant progress thus far by leveraging our integrated offering, which we believe creates substantial value for our clients.\u201d\nGalper continued, \u201cUltimately issuers and sponsors deserve a more robust advisory solution, one that expertly crafts the narrative and positions the company with all stakeholders prior to the IPO process execution, and provides the investor communications, media strategy and social media support necessary to be an exceptional public company post-pricing. This approach better manages risk and uniquely maximizes value into an ultimate liquidity event.\u201d\nUnique Approach to Transaction Advisory\n\u201cWe have invested aggressively to establish ICR Capital as a leading transaction advisory firm,\u201d said Tom Ryan, CEO of ICR. \u201cAs always, our goal was to build on our existing offerings, and in this case, combine both industry and transaction experience with an integrated team of communications professionals that work together to shape the narrative across all constituents and channels. Ultimately, what we have proven over the last 20 years is that positioning and communicating a transaction is every bit as important as how the transaction is structured.\u201d\nPhase One of ICR Capital\u2019s advisory approach begins 12 to 24 months preceding banker and underwriter selection. An integrated advisory team, including investor relations and public relations, works with clients to craft the corporate message and raise awareness among key constituents in the investment community and the media.\nPhase Two of the process, led by ICR Capital, provides end-to-end process management for the transaction, from underwriter selection and syndicate structure to investor targeting, pricing and allocation activities. In addition, the team\u2019s public relations experts drive employee and other stakeholder communication to optimize the listing day experience. ICR also specializes in, and produces long form or short IPO roadshow videos that uniquely and consistently articulate corporate vision and strategy. Bringing all of these capabilities together provides clients with a more effective and efficient way to optimize and communicate any transaction.\nPhase Three manages risk by providing long-term strategic communications support following a transaction, with the goal of optimizing valuation and providing private shareholders with attractive opportunities to monetize their investments. ICR\u2019s communications practice was ranked as the fifth largest in North America* and is one of the largest in the world, a critical differentiator.\nAbout ICR\nEstablished in 1998, ICR partners with companies to optimize transactions through ICR Capital and executes strategic communications programs that achieve business goals, build credibility and enhance long-term enterprise value.

FILE PHOTO: Britain Rallying - Wales Rally GB - FIA World Rally Championship - Wales - 30\/10\/16 Volkswagen Motorsport's Sebastien Ogier celebrates victory Mandatory Credit: Action Images \/ Peter Cziborra Livepic \nOgier led his fellow WRC drivers in launching the Autosport International car show in Birmingham on Thursday as the teams\u2019 cars were launched for the new season starting in two weeks in Monte Carlo. \nThis was the first chance for rally fans to see the 2018 cars, including the new Ford Fiesta WRC that will be driven by Ogier\u2019s M-Sport Ford WRT team. \nOgier only won two rallies last year but consistently finishing on the podium brought him a fifth title in a row and secured the manufacturers trophy for M-Sport in their first WRC season. \nM-Sport used the Ford car to great success and Ogier stressed that getting the American manufacturer on board was key in his decision to return to the team. \n\u201cIt was no secret that I wanted to have that because of the special performance that we have done last year and in the long-term it would have been harder and harder to keep it up against all the manufacturers,\u201d Ogier said following the unveiling of the car. \n\u201cYou need it to have a good backing and I think that is what we have now so I am looking forward to it. It doesn\u2019t mean it is going to be easy. We have more possibilities in the hand now but we still have to use them and bring the car to another level if possible.\u201d \nOgier\u2019s success was particularly aggravating for Hyundai, who were the fastest team in 2017 and won the most rallies in the season. \nHowever, inconsistencies in driving and car performance meant they finished second, with their top driver Thierry Neuville the runner-up to Ogier. \nNeuville admitted he had been left frustrated by finishing second, despite recording four wins, but stressed the determination at Hyundai to build on their success. \n\u201cWe were the best performer during the season, with the fastest times so generally we can\u2019t complain,\u201d the Belgian said. \n\u201dObviously, we missed the main goal at the end of the year, which was to be champion, even if we were leading at mid-season in the championship ahead of Sebastien. That was a great opportunity and we missed it but there is another great opportunity starting in two weeks.\u201d \nBriton Kris Meeke was another left frustrated by the end of 2017, with five retirements during the season costing him dearly. Meeke finished seventh despite winning the rallies in Mexico and Catalonia. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to win every one; we have seen Seb Ogier only won two rallies last year and was world champion. So we just need to bring that consistency and a lot more podiums,\u201d said the Citroen driver. \nThe season starts in Monte Carlo on Jan. 25, the first of 13 races.

The company\u2019s lenders included Barclays ( BARC.L ), HSBC ( HSBA.L ) and Santander UK ( SAN.MC ), it said. \nCarillion, which operates in Canada and the Middle East as well as Britain and employs more than 30,000 people, last month brought forward the start date for new chief executive Andrew Davies to Jan. 22.

No surprise, more people are now starting to tap that cash. What are they spending it on? Mostly making their homes even more valuable. Renovation spending is soaring, and 80% of borrowers taking out home equity lines of credit say they would consider using that money to renovate, according to a survey released in December by TD Bank. \"We're not only seeing more requests for proposals, but more committed projects from homeowners,\" said Steve Cunningham, a remodeler from Williamsburg, Virginia, in a report from the National Association of Home Builders. \"In addition to regular updates and repairs, there's been an uptick in more ambitious large remodel requests.\" Remodeling spending topped $152 billion in 2017, and renovations for owner-occupied single-family homes will increase 4.9% in 2018 over 2017, according to the NAHB. That does not include remodeling done by investors looking to flip or rent properties, both of which are increasing as well. \"Below-normal rates of home building are creating an aging housing stock,\" said Paul Emrath, vice president of survey and housing policy research at the NAHB. \"Factors inhibiting stronger growth include the ongoing labor shortage and rising material prices.\" An older housing stock, combined with not enough new homes being built, means more people will choose to renovate."}

Some 40 percent of the population identifies as Catholic and the Church has long filled voids in education, healthcare and other services left by an absent state.\nIts bishops have frequently spoken out against human rights abuses by the government and alleged plans by Kabila to remove term limits that forbid him to run for re-election.\nHowever, it reverted to a more neutral posture as Kabila\u2019s mandate expired in December 2016 in order to broker a deal between the ruling coalition and opposition leaders.\nUnder the Dec. 31 agreement, Kabila was permitted to stay in office beyond the expiry of his mandate but required to step down after an election to be held in 2017.\nInstead, Congo\u2019s electoral commission said later that the election could not be organised until December 2018, reviving suspicions that Kabila intends to cling to power. Kabila denies those charges and blames the delays on a slow voter registration process.\nDozens have died in protests over Kabila\u2019s future in the past two years and militia violence across the country has also risen, stoking fears the country will slide back into the kind of civil war that killed millions at the turn of the century.\nWriting by Aaron Ross, editing by Larry King\n "}

A report from Expand, part of the BostonConsulting Group and IHS Markit, has estimated that top global banks and asset managers will have spent $2.1 billion last year to comply with the rules. Lawton expects the new regime to trigger consolidation as the competition it aims to promote proves too much for some. \nCredit rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s said there would likely be more losers than winners from the profound changes being ushered in. \nThe aim is increase transparency and bolster investor protection to avoid some of the problems of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Stock, bond, derivatives, commodity and other trades must all be reported to a repository, giving regulators a trove of data to track trades and try to spot bubbles early after failing to see the last crisis coming. \nWhen the rules go live on Wednesday, fund managers and others must for the first time fill in a transaction report with up to 65 bits of data within 15 minutes of a trade - or risk being fined. The rules, known as MiFID II or Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, represent a revamp of the2007 MiFID law to increase transparency and investor protection and broaden its scope to take in more financial products. MiFID II will be a journey and not a one off event inJanuary, is how one national regulator responded to questions about how trading will unfold on January 3. LIQUIDITY WATCH \nThe European Securities and Markets Authority, which is overseeing the roll out, published a flurry of statements just before Christmas to tackle some remaining road bumps. \u201cESMA, in close cooperation with the national regulatory authorities across the EU, has carried out a broad range of work ... to ensure that the framework is in place to ensure a smooth transition from MiFID I to MiFID II,\u201d ESMA Chairman Steven Maijoor told Reuters. So far, only 11 of the EU\u2019s 28 member states have written MiFID II fully into national law. But ESMA has said that all firms can carry on even if their home state has not completed the legislative process. \nGermany, France and Britain, home to the EU\u2019s top financial centres, are among the 11 EU states whose national laws are upto speed and big banks are likely to be ready. Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s ( RBS.L ) NatWest Markets has conducted a \u201csoft launch\u201d. From January 2 to January 4, some of its staff will work through the night. \u201cDay One will hopefully go smoothly and we are as ready as we can be,\u201d Giovanni Mazzocchi, head of macro distribution inEurope for Barclays ( BARC.L ), said. \u201cThere are a few overnighters going on to make sure everything will work on the day.\u201d \nIndustry officials predict light trading volumes initially rather than paralysis. \nA European bond strategist said trading glitches could become a \u201cself-fulfilling prophecy\u201d as people feel their way under the new rules. \n\u201cEveryone says I want to be careful for that first month of the year, and if everyone does that, we won\u2019t have liquidity,\u201d the strategist said. \nDISRUPTIVE ESMA will make use of the new data to set curbs on trading positions in commodities and cap off-exchange trading of shares or so-called \u201cdark pools.\u201d MiFID II also gives investors more information about which trading platforms offer the best deals, and asset managers will have to show investors who is paying for stock research. A fundamental aim of the original MiFID was to increase competition in share trading by allowing new platforms to take on centuries-old rivals like the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ). Upstarts like Chi-X went on to become among the biggestpan-European share trading platforms and regulators want MiFIDII to bring \u201cdisruption\u201d to trading in other assets, forcing companies to become more agile. \u201cThere will be interesting times over the next few years with new players entering the market and both clients and banks making full use of the new available data to shape their activities in the market,\u201d Mazzocchi said. Christian Voigt, senior regulatory adviser at Fidessa, a provider of trading software, said MiFID II did not represent a revolution in share trading, but would have a big impact on bonds, commodities and derivatives, where electronic trading will increase. \u201cFor fixed income and off-exchange derivatives, the wholemindset needs to change as a lot of trades are still done over the phone,\u201d Voigt said. \n(This version of the story corrects reference to \u201cthis year\u201d to \u201clast year\u201d, in the fifth paragraph.)

She is also under pressure to tackle a range of domestic policy problems.\nMay said ministerial changes were necessary following the departure of her long-standing ally and de-facto deputy prime minister Damian Green, who she forced to resign in December after he made misleading statements about pornography found on an office computer.\n\"Obviously, Damian Green's departure before Christmas means that some changes do have to be made, and I will be making some changes,\" she told the BBC in an interview filmed on Saturday for broadcast on Sunday.\nMay said the reshuffle would come soon, but did not give any further details.\nThe Sunday Times said foreign minister Boris Johnson, finance minister Philip Hammond, interior minister Amber Rudd and Brexit minister David Davis would not lose their jobs in the reshuffle.

It raised its profit outlook for 2018 by around 20 percent, citing the new tax legislation.\nDelta said passenger revenue rose in all of the regions where it operates, the first time it posted across-the-board gains in five years. The airline's shares were up more than 5 percent in afternoon trading.\nBut Delta, like its rivals, such as American and United , which report later this month, faced higher fuel costs last year and is now grappling with oil prices at multi-year highs. \nFuel prices still climbing Delta said its fuel expense rose $350 million in the third quarter, and that it paid an average of $1.93 a gallon. It expects to pay around $2.05 to $2.10 a gallon in the first three months of this year.\n\"I think the biggest thing we have going in our favor in 2018 is a strong economy with a lot of optimism,\" Delta's CEO Ed Bastian said on an earnings call Thursday. He admitted, however, that fuel \"is a little bit of a wild card.\"\nThe U.S. economy grew 3.2 percent in the third quarter, the biggest increase for the July through September period, in two years, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.\nCorporate travel revenue last quarter grew at the fastest clip since 2014, the airline said, adding that it will likely continue this year.\nCorporate travel will rise more than 6 percent this year, the highest growth rate since 2011, Deloitte recently estimated.\nEarlier this week, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the new tax legislation would boost business-travel spending this year and that would help boost shares of Delta, United and American, which are heavily reliant on corporate travel revenue. Delta said the tax law would likely spur more corporate travel spending.\nBut investors will task Delta to keep a lid on increasing costs, which the airline expects to rise 2 percent to 4 percent this quarter, not including fuel. Delta said it would try to trim costs for hotels, transportation and fleet management.\nHigher costs will hurt its ability to grow profits in the first three months of the year, it said, forecasting earnings of between 60 and 80 cents a share, below the 83 cents a share forecast by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.\nDelta has been restrained when it comes to growing capacity and expects to upgrade to larger aircraft to meet some of the increasing demand. It expects to grow capacity around 3 percent this quarter, while increasing revenue per each seat it flies \u2014 a key industry metric \u2014 to a gain of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent. Too much growth can lead to depressed fares, which tends to spook investors.\nPassengers are opening their wallets Not only are planes flying fuller, but passengers are willing to shell out more for higher fares. Delta, like its competitors, have sliced up their economy cabins and rolled out new premium cabins to encourage passengers to pay for more room on board and other amenities.\nDelta's president Glen Hauenstein said its so-called branded fares generated $200 million in the fourth quarter, and revenues from upselling passengers on first-class seats and its Comfort+ economy seats increased between 25 percent and 30 percent. \nThose types of fares will contribute $350 million in incremental revenue this year. Delta has said it's bare-bones basic economy fares, which offer little flexibility and no free checked bags, are intended to drive passengers to a more expensive, full-service economy fare. Delta is taking those fares global this year .\nRevenue from its co-branded credit card program with American Express is also on the rise. It said it logged more than 1 million signups for SkyMiles credit card accounts in 2017, an annual record. Delta and other airlines make money by selling airline miles to credit card issuers and those issuers in turn receive new customers.\nNo taxes...yet Because of years of losses in the past, Delta and some other airlines don't pay taxes because of what's known as deferred tax assets. The airline could become a taxpayer in 2019 and 2020, it said, in which case it would be at the the new lower rate. \nOther challenges ahead There are some curveballs Delta has to face this year. Its order for at least 75 Bombardier are stuck in a trade dispute with rival plane-maker Boeing , which complained that its Canadian counterpart sold them to Delta below cost and received illegal government subsidies for the program. So far, the Trump administration has sided with Boeing and recommended tariffs of almost 300 percent on the planes, which seat around 100 to 125 passengers.\nA final ruling is expected later this month and Delta said it doesn't expect to take delivery of the planes this spring, as planned. To match demand, Bastian said the airline is investing in maintaining MD-88 jets, which it intends to retire soon, \"around a bit longer than we were otherwise anticipating. \"\nDelta recently agreed to buy 100 single-aisle Airbus jets , but those don't arrive until 2020."}

I was just really happy for him.\u201d \nAll-rounder Mitchell\u2019s first test hundred came after he was called into the team for the third Ashes clash in Perth and was a reward for the hard work he did on his batting after his recuperation from surgery. \n\u201cTo be honest I really didn\u2019t think I was going to play any part for Australia this summer,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been a whirlwind month for both of us really and we\u2019re just both really happy to be here now and to be contributing to a winning Australian team.\u201d \nShaun\u2019s recall for the series was his eighth and caused huge controversy, the selectors being vindicated when he scored an unbeaten 126 in Adelaide. \n\u201cSix months ago I lost my contract and was left out of the test team and didn\u2019t know what the future held at this level,\u201d he recalled. \n\u201cI went away and wanted to just enjoy myself and when I did get picked again it was emotional.\u201d \nShaun\u2019s 156 on Sunday was his sixth test century and, combined with Mitchell\u2019s 101, helped put Australia in a strong position to claim a 4-0 series victory on the final day on Monday. \nNeither brother, though, was prepared to consider yet whether they might retain their places for the tour of South Africa later this year. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been nice contributing to the team over the last few weeks and today,\u201d said Shaun. \u201cI\u2019ll just keep working hard, keep enjoying it, and not look too far ahead.\u201d (Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)"}

By Filed Jan. 25, 2018, 11 a.m. GMT On a hill overlooking Istanbul is a religious school where, 50 years ago, a boy from a working class district attended classes in Islam. The boy was Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey\u2019s future president. The school was one of the first Imam Hatip schools, founded by the state to educate young men to be imams and preachers. At the start of the 2017-2018 academic year in September, Erdogan returned to his old school, now renamed the Recep Tayyip Erdogan Anatolian Imam Hatip upper school after an $11 million redevelopment. He recalled the \u201ctough days\u201d of his childhood and the spirit in the school that drove its students to success. \u201cThe joint goal of all education and our teaching system is to bring up good people with respect for their history, culture and values,\u201d Erdogan told flag-waving children at a ceremony to mark the reopening of the school. Related content \nFrom July: Turkey rolls out new school curriculum - without Darwin Erdogan has said one of his goals is to forge a \u201cpious generation\u201d in predominantly Muslim Turkey \u201cthat will work for the construction of a new civilisation.\u201d His recent speeches have emphasised Turkey\u2019s Ottoman history and domestic achievements over Western ideas and influences. Reviving Imam Hatip, or Imam and Preacher, schools is part of Erdogan\u2019s drive to put religion at the heart of national life after decades of secular dominance, and his old school is just one beneficiary of a government programme to pump billions of dollars into religious education. A Reuters review of government budget and investment plans shows that spending on Imam Hatip upper schools for boys and girls aged 14 to 18 will double to 6.57 billion lira ($1.68 billion) in 2018 - nearly a quarter of the total upper schools budget. Although the 645,000 Imam Hatip students make up only 11 percent of the total upper school population, they receive 23 percent of funding - double the spend per pupil at mainstream schools. Since 2012, when Imam Hatip education was extended to middle schools for pupils aged 10 to 14, total pupil numbers have risen fivefold to 1.3 million students in over 4,000 schools. The government intends to complete construction of 128 Imam Hatip upper schools in 2018 and has plans to build a further 50, the budget and investment plans show. Turkey has also increased religious education teaching at regular state schools, some of which have been converted into Imam Hatip schools. The government declined to say how many. But for all the extra cash they receive, the Islamic schools are underperforming the regular ones, key metrics show. The education ministry didn\u2019t respond to questions about the expansion of Imam Hatip schools. Education Minister Ismet Yilmaz has said previously that the government is responding to popular demand by opening new Imam Hatip schools. \u201cWe are doing whatever our citizens say,\u201d he said at a ground-breaking ceremony for a school mosque in December. An official in the president\u2019s office referred Reuters to Erdogan\u2019s public remarks on Imam Hatip schools and declined to comment further. A government adviser said, \u201cIslam is not being forced on people. It is not a matter of saying everyone should go to Imam Hatips. We are just providing an opportunity to those families who want to send their children to Imam Hatips.\u201d The expansion of religious education is unsettling some Turks. Interviews with two dozen parents, teachers and education officials point to deep divisions over the role of Islam in education. Some secularist parents say the Islamist school movement is robbing their children of resources and opportunity. Those differences are part of a wider disagreement between liberal and secular sections of society and Erdogan\u2019s support base of conservative, pious Turks. It was that support base that swept Erdogan\u2019s Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party, the AK Party, to power in 2002. Since then, critics have accused Erdogan of rolling back the secular state founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923 and weakening its pillars - the army, judiciary and media. Relations between NATO-member Turkey and its U.S. and European partners have become strained. Ankara\u2019s bid to join the European Union has stalled and Western countries have criticised Turkey over mass arrests that followed a failed military coup in July 2016.

REUTERS\/Murad Sezer PRAISE AND PROTEST The new Recep Tayyip Erdogan Anatolian Imam Hatip school complex, its Islamic-style architecture rising in a historic district on the European side of Istanbul, is a source of pride for the parents of the 800 children who fill its classrooms and playground. \u201cGod willing, all our schools will reach this standard and quality,\u201d said Kamber Cal, 45, a chemist. His 16-year-old son is delighted to attend the school, he said. \u201cMy daughter is now dreaming about going to Imam Hatip, the time when she will cover up and she will learn about the Koran and the Prophet\u2019s life.\u201d In a mosque on the roof, boys listened to a preacher before Friday prayers when a Reuters reporter visited the school in October, while in the playground below, other boys played football. Some students perused books on shelves in the corridors. The school\u2019s website vaunts its success in pursuits including karate, biology, chemistry, Arabic, music and Koran recitation. Religious education lessons account for around a quarter to a third of the curriculum in Imam Hatip schools. Cal and other advocates of Imam Hatip schools say parents want a strong moral education for their children. \u201cIf there is demand, it must be met. How high will this go? To 20, 25, 40 percent\u201d of pupils? \u201cDemand and society will decide,\u201d Cal said. Such a prospect is anathema to secularists, people on the political left and members of the minority Alevi faith, which draws upon Shi\u2019ite, Sufi and Anatolian folk traditions and rituals that differ sharply from those of the country\u2019s Sunni majority. Feray Aytekin Aydogan, chairwoman of the Egitim-Sen teachers\u2019 trade union and a critic of the expansion of Imam Hatip schools, said: \u201cThere is no need to give people religious education in order for them to get a profession.\u201d NEXT GENERATION: Imam Hatip school students at a graduation ceremony in Istanbul in May last year. President Tayyip Erdogan wants to nurture \u201cgood people with respect for their history, culture and values.\u201d REUTERS\/Murad Sezer \u201cWhat we see now is a \u2018national and native\u2019 identity being constructed in education.\u201d Batuhan Aydagul, director of Education Reform Initiative, an independent think tank in Istanbul Erdogan\u2019s redeveloped school stands as a paragon among religious schools. On the Asian side of the city, the crowded 60th Year Sarigazi middle school, established six decades after the founding of Turkey\u2019s secular republic, illustrates some challenges that the spread of Imam Hatip schools has presented. Sarigazi is a non-religious school, in an area with a strong Alevi and secular community, but a large part of the premises has been converted into an Imam Hatip school. A group of parents has petitioned education authorities to stop the conversion, collecting hundreds of signatures. Those parents say the change began several years ago with a few Imam Hatip \u201cguest\u201d classes but has since expanded to 1,300 pupils, encroaching on the building where some 3,000 students study in a regular middle school. The mother of a 10-year-old girl at the regular school said she and other parents would continue their fight against the school\u2019s conversion. She said it was wrong to force Islam on people. Like several other secularist parents interviewed, the woman declined to give her name. Parents complained that non-religious students at the 60th Year Sarigazi middle school get less support than Imam Hatip students and that their classes are more crowded, with an average 40 pupils in a classroom, compared with 30 on the Imam Hatip side. They say they have lost laboratory and art space. The mother of a boy at the school said her son asked, \u201cWhy is the Imam Hatip part of the school better?\u201d Reuters could not independently verify the parents\u2019 claims and the education ministry declined to comment. But in response to the parents\u2019 petition, education authorities said there were plans to build a new school in the area. It was unclear which students would move there. Parents at the Sarigazi middle school claim success for another petition they filed in October to halt construction of a wall at one end of a playground. They saw the wall as an attempt to divide the school permanently. The local education authority said it had halted construction, without giving a reason. A group of parents at another school - the Mahmut Kemal Inal middle school on the Asian side of Istanbul - failed in a campaign to prevent it being converted into an Imam Hatip. They picketed at the gates and organised protests and a petition signed by hundreds. It was to no avail. The only intake for the 2017-2018 academic year was of Imam Hatip students. \u201cI am sad that we were ignored,\u201d said Fulya Yilmaz, whose 11-year-old daughter attends the school. Education authorities said the local community wanted the school to become an Imam Hatip school. But Yilmaz said only 125 students had enrolled in September, a low intake. On average around 230 pupils normally study in each of the school\u2019s four year groups. The education authority declined to comment on enrolment details. \u201cSCHOOLS FOR MORALITY\u201d Successive AK Party governments have given a high priority to education, ramping up the education ministry\u2019s spending to some 12.3 percent of the entire budget this year from 6.9 percent in 2003, the AK Party\u2019s first full year in power. Despite all the money allocated to the schools, figures on 2017 university placements show graduates of religious schools lag their peers in regular schools. Only 18 percent of applicants from religious schools earned places on full degree courses at university last year, compared with 35 percent from regular state upper schools and 45 percent from private upper schools. A survey of academic performance published in December 2016 for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development showed the success of Imam Hatip upper school students was below the national average. More broadly, Turkey slipped an average of eight places in the survey\u2019s rankings for science, mathematics and reading, compared with the previous study three years earlier, to 50th among 72 countries. That marked a reversal of the progress Turkey made in the previous two terms of AK Party government. It was also a setback for Erdogan, who hopes that driving up education standards will help achieve his target of making Turkey one of the world\u2019s 10 largest economies by 2023, the centenary of the founding of Ataturk\u2019s secular republic. Turkey is currently a member of the Group of 20 top global economies. Reuters could not determine whether socioeconomic factors were contributing to the performance gap between Imam Hatip and regular schools because there is no data available on pupils\u2019 family backgrounds, their income and education. However, religious schools are found in towns and cities across Turkey, in poor and affluent districts. While the number of Imam Hatip schools has surged in recent years, the number of students in Imam Hatip upper schools dipped slightly last year. Opposition lawmaker Engin Altay said the slide was \u201cdirectly correlated with the low success rate of Imam Hatip upper schools in an academic sense.\u201d Education Ministry Undersecretary Yusuf Tekin said Imam Hatip upper schools had filled 84 percent of their quota for 2017-2018. Standard curriculum upper schools had exceeded theirs. Advocates of Imam Hatip schools say the current expansion should be seen in the context of the previous suppression of these schools. They point to a crackdown in 1997 when Turkey\u2019s then powerful military pressured the first Islamist-led government out of power and forced the closure of most Imam Hatip establishments. Muslims went out into the squares to defend their rights in protests. Businessman Hanefi Gundogan, 49, said he was unable to send his eldest son to an Imam Hatip school because of the crackdown, but now his youngest attends such a school. \u201cMuslims have now reached a point where they can breathe more easily in their own country,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last 15 years this government has shown respect to Muslims.\u201d Halit Bekiroglu, chairman of an association of Imam Hatip members and graduates, said secularist fears about the schools were exaggerated. Their revival, he said, reflected the conservative religious character of most of Turkish society and a desire for a change in an education system that previously imported Western ideas. CONSERVATIVE CHARACTER: Halit Bekiroglu, says the revival of Imam Hatip schools reflects the traditional Islamic nature of most of Turkish society. Bekiroglu, chairman of an association of Imam Hatip members and graduates, is seen here at his office in Istanbul in January. REUTERS\/Murad Sezer \u201cModernisation and Westernisation were not implemented healthily. They were implemented in a superficial, formalistic, harsh, copy-paste way. This was not in harmony with this country\u2019s sociology,\u201d he told Reuters in the association\u2019s offices, overlooking the huge dome of the 6th century Hagia Sophia. Parents who send their children to Imam Hatip schools speak of their desire for them to have a strong moral education. It\u2019s a theme Erdogan stressed during his visit to his old school. \u201cThe school brought up children with such morality that they would not even pick fruit which hung from the apple tree hanging over the school walls,\u201d he said. reuters investigates \nGot a confidential news tip? Reuters Investigates offers several ways to securely contact our reporters Whatever the origins of the Islamist education revival, critics are worried by it. Batuhan Aydagul, director of Education Reform Initiative, an independent think tank in Istanbul, said: \u201cWhat we see now is a \u2018national and native\u2019 identity being constructed in education.\u201d The most recent national curriculum, announced in July, excluded Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution from science lessons. The government has also doubled religious teaching in regular schools to two hours per week. This compulsory teaching is a bone of contention for many secular Turks. Some have launched legal action to secure exemptions for their children. One parent who did so successfully was mathematical engineer Ozlem Koc, 42, who lives on the Asian side of Istanbul. She won a court case in June after a year-long battle with education authorities to exempt her 10-year-old son from religious education, arguing that it was contrary to human rights to force it on children. \u201cThis is not just my personal case,\u201d she said. \u201cI want my child to be exempt from religious lessons, but I am also fighting for compulsory religious education to be removed from the curriculum.\u201d NATIONAL FERVOUR: Imam Hatip school students wave Turkish flags as they wait for President Tayyip Erdogan to arrive at a graduation ceremony in Istanbul in May last year.

A rally sent oil prices nearly 6 percent higher for the year, to trade at their best since December 2014. Crude has surged 133 percent since hitting a multi-year low of $27.30 a barrel in February 2016. \nHowever, market conditions do not currently support crude oil above $60 a barrel, says John Kilduff , partner at Again Capital and a veteran market watcher. He expects a pullback to more reasonable levels in the near-term. \n\"As we get into the new year now and another season of refinery maintenance and much lower gasoline demand, I see the base case fundamentally as arguing for lower prices from here at least for a while,\" Kilduff told CNBC's \" Futures Now \" this week. \nHigh U.S. oil production could also put a dampener on the crude rally, added Kilduff, potentially negating the benefits of a deal among Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to restrict supply even further. That would effectively support prices. \nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that production growth in the U.S., Canada and Brazil would bump non-OPEC supply higher by 1.7 million barrels per day in 2018. U.S. crude supply alone could surpass 10 million barrels a day \u2014 beating out Saudi Arabia and Russia for the title of world's largest oil producer. \nKilduff sees a range of $50 to $55 a barrel as more appropriate for the current market. Crude oil last settled as low as $55 in November, and closed above $63 in Friday's trading. \nIn a silver lining for commodity traders, Kilduff does not see a return to the lows seen in 2015 and 2016, when prices cratered below $30. High production levels and weak demand for oil set off a crude selloff in late 2014 that stretched through to early 2016. \n\"We're certainly out of the woods that we were in 18 months ago or so when there was abject oversupply of crude oil and refined products,\" said Kilduff. \"The global glut has been worked off to a large degree, in part because of the OPEC\/non-OPEC agreement, but also because of other exogenous events that occurred.\" \nOPEC members have largely complied with an output deal that has contributed to a correction of the global imbalance between supply and demand. A agreement to cut production went into effect at the beginning of 2017, and is set to expire at year's end after several extensions. \nTwo major pipeline outages, including the Keystone XL pipeline, and a string of devastating hurricanes in the latter half of 2017 helped to balance the domestic oil market. Those events temporarily limited U.S. production and created a sharp drawdown in domestic supplies. show chapters"}

Soccer Football - Premier League - Swansea City vs Tottenham Hotspur - Liberty Stadium, Swansea, Britain - January 2, 2018 Swansea City manager Carlos Carvalhal REUTERS\/Toby Melville \nThe Portuguese manager, who replaced the sacked Paul Clement last month, said he met the club\u2019s chairman Huw Jenkins over recruitment following Swansea\u2019s 2-0 loss to Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Tuesday. \n\u201cWe have money for sardines and I\u2018m thinking lobster,\u201d Carvalhal told reporters ahead of Swansea\u2019s FA Cup third round trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday. \n\u201dI will do my best to try and bring in the best players.

{"published":"2018-01-20T05:43:00.000+02:00","title":"SHUTDOWN 2018","text":"9:03 AM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 | 02:07 \nA House-passed stopgap bill that would avoid a government shutdown fizzled out in the Senate late Friday night, leaving Congress negotiating frantically as the midnight deadline to fund the government passed. \nThe measure failed in a procedural vote by a 50 to 49 margin. Five Democrats \u2014 Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Doug Jones of Alabama and Claire McCaskill of Missouri \u2014 had backed it. Four Republicans \u2014 Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 opposed it. So did Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for procedural reasons. \nAs nearly all Democrats and some Republicans opposed the measure that failed to work its way through Congress on Friday, lawmakers saw government funding lapse, at least temporarily. The proposal that failed in the Senate would have funded the government through Feb. 16 and reauthorized the popular Children's Health Insurance Program for six years. \nAs the vote remained open into early Saturday morning, several bipartisan senators appeared to confer about a way forward. McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer then walked off the Senate floor together, only to return and continue talks with other senators. Numerous senators crowded around Schumer as the clock hit midnight. \nNegotiations and potentially votes are expected to continue over the weekend and into next week. McConnell said he will offer an amendment to extend government funding until Feb. 8, which Sen. Lindsey Graham championed on Friday. \nMany Democrats and some Republicans announced they would vote against a short-term deal, criticizing the continued use of stopgap bills rather than funding the government through more long-term, stable mechanisms. The minority party has also shown frustration about progress on talks toward a bipartisan immigration bill, which Democrats wanted to pass this week to protect hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation. \nThe parties also remain divided over long-term defense and non-defense spending levels \n\"We're going to continue to do all we can,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor after the shutdown started. \"We'll vote again so the American people know who stands for them. And when our friends across the aisle remember who it is they actually represent, we'll be ready to come together in a bipartisan discussion that will be necessary to clean up all of this mess.\" \nThe Senate needs to garner 60 votes for a spending bill. With 50 Republicans present, the majority GOP needed to win support from 10 or more Democrats, many of whom had threatened to oppose a short-term spending plan if they could not also pass a bill shielding young undocumented immigrants from deportation. (Sen. John McCain is away from Washington, receiving treatment for cancer.) \nThe bill's apparent failure in the Senate was the last step toward the first government shutdown since 2013. \nIn remarks following McConnell's comments, Schumer said he was \"willing to compromise\" with Trump on an immigration agreement and said he thought he had a deal with the president during a White House meeting Friday. The senator contended that Trump backed off of a possible immigration solution when he faced pressure from conservatives. \n\"Now all of this problem is because Republican leadership can't get to yes, because President Trump refuses to. Mr. President, President Trump, if you are listening, I am urging you: please take yes for an answer,\" he said, adding that the \"blame should crash entirely\" on the president's shoulders. \nAs funding looked set to lapse at midnight, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a scathing statement blaming Democrats for the shutdown. \n\"We will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while Democrats hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands. This is the behavior of obstructionist losers, not legislators. When Democrats start paying our armed forces and first responders we will reopen negotiations on immigration reform,\" she said. \nSchumer has argued for a bill that extended funding only for a few days, rather than a month, to give lawmakers more time to hash out a long-term plan. He met with President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon, and though he said their talks yielded \"some progress,\" they did not reach a deal to keep the government open . \nOn Thursday night, majority House Republican leaders had to keep nearly all of their members in line in order to approve the short-term spending legislation by a 230 to 197 margin. With Democrats putting up a nearly unified front against the measure, GOP lawmakers cleared a bill that would fund the government for about a month. \nEleven Republicans opposed the legislation, while six Democrats supported it. \nTrump had backed the short-term funding plan. Republicans this week put the burden on Senate Democrats to avoid a government shutdown. \n\"Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate \u2013 but they want illegal immigration and weak borders,\" Trump contended in a tweet Friday morning. \"Shutdown coming? We need more Republican victories in 2018!\" \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan used the line of attack after the House passed the bill on Thursday night. \n\"Senator Schumer, do not shut down the federal government,\" the Wisconsin Republican said at a news conference. \nThe Democrats facing the most political peril in the vote are those who face re-election this year in states Trump won, including McCaskill, Heitkamp, Manchin and Donnelly. \nIf a shutdown occurs, McConnell intends to keep the Senate in session over the weekend and force those Democrats to face a series of difficult votes, according to Politico and NBC News."}

Amazon\u2019s Alexa assistant lost her voice in the company\u2019s preview of its Super Bowl ad. \nAdvertisers are likely to stick with proven strategies, such as comedy or positive emotions rather than controversies such as athletes kneeling during the National Anthem , marketing experts said. \n\u201cMy strong prediction is you will see a lot more safe ads,\u201d said Derek Rucker, marketing professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, which runs an annual review of Super Bowl commercials. \nRead: These Super Bowl LII Commercials Are Already Streaming Online \nRatings for National Football League games dropped nearly 10% during the regular season. Media experts said protests over racial inequality drove some viewers away. TV broadcasters showed players kneeling or locking arms during pre-game presentations of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d prompting President Donald Trump to call them unpatriotic. \nSuper Bowl advertisers are likely to avoid the topic altogether, said Charles R. Taylor, marketing professor at the Villanova School of Business. His research has found that 49% of Super Bowl commercials during the past decade used humor, which he expects to continue. \n\u201cThe country is just so divided that, for a mass marketer, I think it\u2019s really a mistake to make any type of political statement,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIn the long run, you don\u2019t make up for the people you alienate.\u201d \nRead: Local Craft Brewers Are Betting Big on Super Bowl 52 \nLast year, a handful of spots hit on topics such as immigration and diversity but took measured tones aimed at appealing to a broad range of viewers, Taylor said. \nFor this year\u2019s game, veterans organization Amvets tried to place a one-page advertisement with the message \u201c#PleaseStand\u201d in the Super Bowl program. The NFL rejected the ad and said the program was not a place for anything that could be viewed as a political statement. \nThe game program will include a Veterans of Foreign Wars ad that supports veterans, and the league will celebrate the military at the game, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told ESPN Radio on Tuesday. \nRead: Minnesota Is Seeing Lots of Flu Cases Ahead of Super Bowl LII \nOn television, advertisers cannot afford any missteps. Broadcaster NBC, a unit of Comcast (cmcsa) , charged an average of $5 million-plus for a 30-second spot. More than 100 million viewers are expected to watch the contest. \nThis year, more brands are holding back their ads to preserve the element of surprise rather than posting them online in advance of game day. \nSome that have revealed their strategies are tying their products to social missions, an approach that appeals to millennials, Taylor said. \nIn one case, actor Matt Damon tells viewers that Anheuser Busch Inbev (bud) label Stella Artois is donating funds to bring clean water to Africa. Carmaker Hyundai (hymtf) plans a 60-second commercial that recognizes people fighting pediatric cancers and spotlights the company\u2019s nonprofit organization dedicated to the cause. \nSome brands may opt for a dark or political theme to try to stand out from the roughly 50 ads that run during the game, Rucker said. \n\u201cIf there are a couple that break that trend, they will get more attention,\u201d Rucker said. \u201cThe question will be will they navigate it properly, or will they be the source of ridicule?\u201d SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

The NRF previously forecast sales would rise 3.6 to 4 percent for the period. Holiday sales can account for up to 40 percent of annual sales for some stores.\nWhile strong sales were widely expected, many retailers were particularly hungry to prove themselves this past holiday season, following a year marred by tumbling stock prices, management shakeups, a slew of store closures and several industry bankruptcies.\nThe Dow Jones Retailers Index .DJUSRT was up 1.5 percent on Friday afternoon, led by jumps in the stock prices of Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ), Target Corp ( TGT.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), among others.\nSlideshow (2 Images) NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said a number of factors contributed to surging consumer confidence including a pickup in income, a rising stock market, unemployment levels at 17-year lows and the timing of the tax cuts.\n\u201cWhen that got passed and companies started to announce bonuses and wage increases, the consumer felt very much more at ease going into the holiday season and spending,\u201d Kleinhenz said in an interview, adding the possible tax cuts had not been accounted for in the NRF\u2019s forecast.\nSeveral large U.S. employers, including Walmart, American Airlines Group Inc ( AAL.O ), AT&T Inc ( T.N ) and Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ), have announced employee bonuses or wage increases after U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul in December cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.\nKleinhenz also said retailers had the right mix of inventory, pricing and staffing to help connect with shoppers.\nStruggling with competition from Amazon and off-price stores, traditional retailers have worked hard to address changing consumer habits by lowering prices, sprucing up physical stores and websites and improving delivery options.\nReporting by Richa Naidu; Editing by Anna Driver and Matthew Lewis\n "}

Standard Life Aberdeen said all UK and European funds on its platform were compliant by the deadline. \nCharles Stanley and Interactive Investor were not able to immediately confirm whether they had suspended any funds. \nThe suspensions will limit choice for investors, though some analysts say the industry has long been oversupplied, and they mark an embarrassing admission that parts of the investment sector have been too slow to implement major new regulations. \nThe rules took effect on Jan. 1 and require each fund to have a new Key Information Document (KID) available online for investors. The aim is to give information in a standardised format so investors can compare risks and costs across products and providers. \nWith the rules not finalised until September 2017, investment trusts had not had much time to get the relevant information in place, said Ian Sayers, chief executive of trade body The Association of Investment Companies (AIC). \n\u201cSomething that should have had 12 months as a transitional period ended up with a matter of weeks,\u201d he said, adding he expected most funds to comply with the rules relatively quickly. \nThe Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the sector, had no immediate comment. \nMore important, Sayers said, was whether the new information was useful for investors, with projections for future risk and returns coloured by recent strong performance for many funds as a result of easy central bank liquidity that few expect to last. \nThe launch of PRIIPs coincided with an even bigger set of new rules on Jan. 3 - the European Union\u2019s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, or MiFID II - which further complicated the efforts of some to get ready on time. \nThe introduction of MiFID II generally went off without a hitch, the European regulator said on Wednesday, although some participants were given a last-minute waiver. HARGREAVES, BESTINVEST \nHargreaves Lansdown, Britain\u2019s biggest online investment platform, said it had suspended around 1,200 ETFs and 300 investment trusts from its website on Tuesday as they had not supplied the correct KIDs in time. That equates to about a third of ETFs and just under a half of trusts on the platform. \nThe funds remain on the platform, but are not visible on the website and the company said it would not accept any fresh money from either new or existing clients into the funds. \nAround 900 of the ETFs are U.S.-based and Hargreaves spokesman Danny Cox said he did not expect them to ever provide the correct KIDs. The other 300 are Europe-based and would likely provide them over time. \nOf the 300 investment trusts, funds listed on the stock exchange as companies, around 200 are predominantly U.S.-based and not likely to comply, Cox said. \u201cMy understanding is that UK distribution by U.S. domiciled investment trusts and ETFs isn\u2019t a priority for them.\u201d \nOf the remaining 96 investment trusts, the majority are UK-based and Cox, confirming earlier reports, said he expected them to provide the correct information and return to the website. \n\u201cThe situation is moving, 10 are already back on and we are putting investments back onto the website as and when they provide the correct KID,\u201d Cox said. \u201cTo put this into context, the vast majority of Hargreaves Lansdown investors hold UK-domiciled investments and are unaffected by this issue.\u201d \nBestinvest, meanwhile, said it had suspended an unspecified number of investment trusts, including Sanditon Investment Trust, but at least two had since complied with the rules and were now available again. \n\u201cWe are working with our data vendor to identify cases where PRIIP-compliant documentation is not in place and, where this is the case, we have and will temporarily suspend access to dealing in these,\u201d a spokesman for Bestinvest said. \n\u201cThe situation is incredibly fluid as trusts have been rapidly supplying these over the last couple of days.\u201d (Additional reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Mark Potter)"}

They just empowered every corporation in America to make more money,\" Howard Lutnick said on CNBC's \"Fast Money.\"\nIn the aftermath of President Trump's election, Lutnick called the bank rally, predicting that loosened regulations would stimulate growth and benefit the economy all around.\nLutnick is still bullish on the implications of deregulation. Now he's saying, with added corporate tax cuts, the market is going to keep pushing on upward, after some initial bumps due to fear of the unknown.\n\"People are worried, people are scared, they're just not used to a 14 percent corporate tax cut,\" Lutnick said.\n\"People are focusing on the fact that they've got to repatriate some money from overseas, so it looks bad for a quarter or two. You know what, once that quarter or two is passed and the earnings pound forward, you're going to continue to see a positive market,\" he added.\nDespite his bullishness, Lutnick doesn't think the rally will translate to increased demand for various lines of bank business, for example, increased demand for loans.\n\"I don't buy you're going to see new loan growth. I never bought that stuff. What I see is, the financial institutions are going to make more money, they're just going to make more money,\" he said.\nAs for market disruptions, Lutnick sees none, barring exogenous factors, like run-ins with North Korea. Even Federal Reserve rate hikes won't get in the way, according to Lutnick, so long as they don't surpass the 2 to 3 percent he anticipates.\n\"To harm the stock market, you need to see a huge bump in the interest rates...and that requires a busting economy. So why would a busting economy, which would move interest rates, be bad for the stock market? The problem is, it's not there,\" he said.\n\"I think what you're in is a market like we were in last year, which means good things are underlying and there's no clouds,\" he added."}

But definitely I\u2018m in the right direction.\u201d \nChen opened the season by beating defending Olympic and world champion Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan in Moscow, landing four quadruple jumps in his short program including a breathtaking combination of the quad lutz and triple toe loop. \nIn November he won the Skate America grand prix event despite one of the worst free skates of his senior career. \nHe had planned five quadruple jumps but only attempted four and put his hand on the ice on his quad flip before falling on his quad toeloop. \nChen redeemed himself at the Grand Prix Final in December, overcoming an error-filled free skate to win the title.

Even our closest allies must follow the rules,\u201d he said in a statement. \nThe Commerce Department accuses Canada of unfairly subsidizing and dumping softwood lumber, which is commonly used in the construction of homes. Canada denies it is dumping the lumber.

Shares in the firms were little changed on Wednesday. \nThe decision to impose tariffs followed failed talks to end the decades-long dispute between the two countries. The row centers on the fees paid by Canadian lumber mills for timber cut largely from government-owned land. Those fees are lower than fees paid on U.S. timber, which comes largely from private land. \nJoe Patton, U.S. Lumber Coalition Co\u2010Chair and Vice President of Wood Products at The Westervelt Company, defended the U.S. move on Wednesday. \n\u201cThese duties are a fair enforcement of U.S. trade law. For decades, the Canadian government has abused the law and provided massive subsidies to its lumber industry, harming U.S. producers and workers,\u201d he said. \nThe Lumber Trade Council of British Columbia, a province with a significant forestry industry, said last month it was confident the decision would be overturned, calling it \u201ccompletely without merit.\u201d \nAround 33 percent of the lumber used in the United States in 2016 was imported, with more than 95 percent coming from Canada, according to the U.S. National Association of Homebuilders.

He said he had asked for the case to be dealt with transparently and been assured that proper legal procedures would be followed. \n\u201cI hope that this would not snowball in adverse directions for both the international press and the Myanmar government,\u201d Surakiart added. \u201cI hope the case will not lead to the Myanmar government not welcoming the international press. I want this to be a specific case and hope for a quick resolution to it.\u201d BRIDGING THE GAP \nThe Annan-led panel delivered its recommendations - which also included a review of a law that links citizenship and ethnicity and leaves most Rohingya stateless - just before insurgent attacks on security posts on Aug. 25 triggered the latest crisis. \nSurakiart said there were concerns over the repatriation of those who had since fled to Bangladesh and that the advisory board would need to find an approach to ensure people could return without fear, even if they were not recognized by existing law as Myanmar citizens. \nSuu Kyi has faced international criticism for perceived inaction over the crisis in Rakhine, but Surakiart said she was constrained by domestic politics. \nBuddhist nationalism has surged in Myanmar in recent years, and the army campaign has wide support. \n\u201cAung San Suu Kyi tried to address the issue by trying to build consensus from within rather than finger-pointing,\u201d said Surakiart. \n\u201cThere is a big gap between domestic and international interpretations of the situation in Rakhine. If we can\u2019t bridge this gap then it will be an obstacle for all of us who want to improve the situation.\u201d \nThe former Thai foreign minister also said his advisory board would seek to engage with all groups in Rakhine, including the military. \n\u201cThe advisory board is not a mouthpiece to anyone,\u201d Surakiart said. \u201cWe are not a spokesperson for Myanmar or the international community.\u201d \nThe board, which is made up of five members from Myanmar and five international appointees including veteran former U.S. politician and diplomat Bill Richardson, will meet the Myanmar government on Jan. 22 in the capital Naypyitaw before making its first trip to Rakhine on Jan. 24. \n\u201cI do not want the advisory board to be just a talking shop,\u201d Surakiart said. \u201cWe want to help bring about tangible progress.\u201d Additional report by Chayut Setboonsarng; Editing by Matthew Tostevin and Alex Richardson"}

The meeting is part of a process to market iQOS as being less risky than cigarettes. \nIf this all sounds like a foreign language, here are the basics. \nWhat are heat-not-burn tobacco products?  As the name suggests, they heat tobacco but don't burn them. Igniting tobacco causes it to undergo a chemical process that emits toxins in cigarettes. \nUnlike e-cigarettes, which use nicotine-laced liquid, heat-not-burn products use real tobacco. They warm tobacco sticks to a temperature that's high enough to release an aerosol but not enough to cause combustion.They may significantly reduce risk while satisfying users' nicotine cravings. \nPhilip Morris has already launched iQOS in more than 30 markets. Rival British American Tobacco 's version, glo, is available in six markets. The company plans to file a substantial equivalence application, a less onerous process, for glo to the FDA this year. \nHow does iQOS work? The iQOS tobacco heating system contains three parts: a holder, tobacco stick and a charger. \nThe pen-like device contains a ceramic and gold plate that heats Philip Morris-branded tobacco sticks up to 350 degrees Celsius. Tobacco in cigarettes burns at temperatures at or greater than 600 degrees Celsius. \nThe tobacco sticks are designed specifically for the device. In the U.S., PMI wants to offer Marlboro, Marlboro Smooth Menthol and Marlboro Fresh Menthol HeatSticks. \nPMI says the product is a closer experience to smoking cigarettes than other alternatives, such as e-cigarettes, because it uses actual tobacco. The company says that could convince adult smokers to switch exclusively to iQOS.\nCritics point to e-cigarettes being used in addition to and perhaps even leading users into conventional cigarettes. PMI is quick to note iQOS is not an e-cigarette, and the presence of tobacco may not have the same appeal as fruity, sweet nicotine-laced liquid. \nIs iQOS safe? PMI says iQOS is not risk-free, rather it's less risky than conventional cigarettes. \nThe company stresses quitting smoking is the best way to reduce risk and that iQOS is meant for adult smokers who want to continue using tobacco, not kids or non-smokers. PMI has found exclusively using iQOS significantly lowers users' risk of harm than if they were to continue smoking cigarettes.\nThe FDA's review of iQOS identified lower levels of toxic chemicals than cigarettes. It could not say that using the device led to a decreased risk of illnesses associated with smoking because doing so would require a longer study.\nThe FDA will decide whether iQOS can be marketed as being safer than cigarettes. \nWhen might I see iQOS on shelves? Philip Morris is outlining its findings this week to an independent committee that will make a recommendation to the FDA on whether to approve the company's reduced-risk marketing claims. \nThe committee's decision is only a suggestion, meaning the FDA is not required to follow it. The timing of the agency's ultimate decision is unclear. Some have suggested May, which would mark one year since the FDA said it would review the application.\nEven if the FDA rejects PMI's modified-risk application, going through the process may help its application to sell the device. The Tobacco Control Act calls for the FDA to respond to premarket tobacco applications within 180 days. The agency began reviewing PMI's in August, so it could give an answer in February."}

She said she was returning to her former post in the TV newsroom in London where she expected to be paid equally to men in equal jobs. \n\u201cI am not asking for more money. I believe I am very well paid already -- especially as someone working for a publicly funded organization. I simply want the BBC to abide by the law and value men and women equally,\u201d she wrote on her website. \nGracie said she was paid 135,000 pounds ($182,800) a year as China editor. According to last July\u2019s disclosures, North America Editor Jon Sopel earned between 200,000 and 250,000 pounds a year, while Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen was in the 150,000 to 200,000 bracket. \nEurope editor Katya Adler, the BBC\u2019s only other female editor in foreign news, did not feature in the disclosures, meaning her pay was less than 150,000 pounds. \nGracie said managers had offered to increase her pay to 180,000 pounds, but that was no solution. She rejected the rise and insisted that all four of the BBC\u2019s international editors should receive equal pay. \n\u201cI was not interested in more money. I was interested in equality,\u201d she said during an interview on BBC radio. FILE PHOTO: The main entrance to the BBC headquarters and studios is seen in Portland Place, London, Britain, July 16, 2015. REUTERS\/Peter Nicholls\/File Photo \nBritain enacted legislation outlawing sex discrimination in the 1970s and this was followed by an equality act in 2010, but women still earn less than men across much of the economy. \n\u201cENOUGH IS ENOUGH\u201d \nThe BBC defended itself by saying its gender pay gap was below the national average and less bad than at many other organizations, adding that it was committed to wiping it out by 2020. It also said an independent audit of rank and file staff had found \u201cno systemic discrimination against women\u201d at the BBC. \nSeveral high-profile women seized on the Gracie story to say the problem was much bigger than the BBC and affected the whole of society. \n\u201cTip of the iceberg in @BBC & most other orgs (organizations). Equality Act 2010 means no hiding place for shameful discrimination against women. Ending it long overdue,\u201d wrote prominent lawmaker Harriet Harman of the opposition Labour Party, a long-time advocate of women\u2019s equality, on Twitter. \nAs in many other countries, pay inequality based on gender has been a persistent problem in Britain, which by some measures has performed worse than comparable European countries in recent years. Britain was ranked 15th in the World Economic Forum\u2019s global gender gap index 2017, below France and Germany. \nBut Gracie said her complaint was not about the gender pay gap the BBC admits to, which stems from men earning more on average because they do more of the best paid jobs. \u201cIt is men earning more in the same jobs or jobs of equal value. It is pay discrimination and it is illegal,\u201d she said. \nGracie accused the BBC of adopting a botched \u201cdivide and rule\u201d response to the legitimate anger of female staff, offering pay rises to some women while locking down others in a protracted complaints process. In her own case, the process had been \u201cdismayingly incompetent and undermining\u201d, she said. \n\u201cEnough is enough. The rise of China is one of the biggest stories of our time and one of the hardest to tell,\u201d she wrote, citing Chinese state censorship, surveillance, police harassment and official intimidation. \n\u201cI cannot do it justice while battling my bosses and a byzantine complaints process.\u201d Additional reporting by Michael Martina in Beijing; editing by David Stamp"}

Translation of the Company's foreign subsidiary results from their functional currencies to U.S. dollars had a favorable impact on sales for the current quarter. On a constant currency basis total net sales for the first quarter would have been $96.2 million, an increase of 8 percent compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. Net income for the first quarter was $12.6 million, an increase of 7 percent from the prior year fiscal quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.90 compared to $0.82 in the prior year fiscal quarter. Gross margin percentage was 55.5 percent compared to 57.2 percent in the prior year fiscal quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses were up 8 percent in the first quarter to $31.2 million when compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. Advertising and sales promotion expenses were up 6 percent to $5.1 million compared to the prior year fiscal quarter.\n\"The tribe has delivered solid first quarter results, reflecting excellent execution of our first and second strategic initiatives and the fact that for the first time in a long-time, foreign currency exchange rates are not diluting our reported net sales results,\" said Garry Ridge, WD-40 Company's president and chief executive officer.\n\"Our flagship product, WD-40 Multi-Use Product grew 10 percent in the first quarter, and our WD-40 Specialist product line grew 29 percent compared to the prior year quarter.\n\"Overall we are off to a good start in 2018 and we believe our focus on executing against our strategic initiatives will continue to drive revenue growth, further strengthen our financial foundation, and enhance shareholder value,\" Ridge concluded.\nNet Sales by Segment (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended November 30,\n2017\n2016\nChange\nAmericas\n$\n46,163\n$\n42,840\n8%\nEMEA\n35,028\n30,257\n16%\nAsia-Pacific\n16,406\n16,151\n2%\nTotal\n$\n97,597\n$\n89,248\n9%\nNet sales by segment as a percent of total net sales for the first quarter were as follows: for the Americas, 47 percent; for EMEA, 36 percent; and for Asia-Pacific, 17 percent. Net sales in the Americans were up 8 percent in the first quarter primarily due to strong maintenance product sales in the United States, Latin America and Canada which increased overall by 11 percent from period to period. This higher level of sales was primarily attributable to an 11 percent increase of WD-40 Multi-Use Product sales as well as a 16 percent increase of WD-40 Specialist sales throughout the Americas segment compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. Net sales in EMEA increased 16 percent in the first quarter primarily due to strong maintenance product sales in both the European direct and distributor markets which increased in total by 17 percent. This higher level of sales was primarily attributable to a 14 percent increase of WD-40 Multi-Use Product sales as well as a 77 percent increase of WD-40 Specialist sales throughout the EMEA segment compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on sales for the EMEA segment from period to period. On a constant currency basis EMEA sales for the first quarter would have increased by $3.7 million or 12 percent compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. Net sales in Asia-Pacific increased 2 percent in the first quarter due to a 6 percent increase in sales in the Asia-Pacific distributor markets which were primarily attributable to a higher level of promotional activities. The sales growth in the Asia distributor markets was partially offset by a 9 percent sales decline in China due to the timing of customer orders in the region. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on sales for the Asia-Pacific segment from period to period. On a constant currency basis Asia-Pacific sales for the first quarter would have been constant compared to the prior year fiscal quarter.\nNet Sales by Product Group (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended November 30,\n2017\n2016\nChange\nMaintenance products\n$\n88,030\n$\n79,159\n11%\nHomecare and cleaning products\n9,567\n10,089\n(5)%\nTotal\n$\n97,597\n$\n89,248\n9%\nNet sales of maintenance products, which are considered the primary growth focus for the Company, increased 11 percent in the first quarter when compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. This increase was driven primarily by strong sales of both WD-40 Multi-Use Product and WD-40 Specialist. Net sales of homecare and cleaning products decreased 5 percent in the first quarter compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. The homecare and cleaning products, particularly those in the U.S., are considered harvest brands providing healthy profit returns to the Company but are becoming a smaller part of the business as net sales of maintenance products grow per the execution of the Company's strategic initiatives.\nDividend and Share Repurchase\nAs previously announced, WD-40 Company's board of directors declared on Tuesday, December 12, 2017 a quarterly dividend of $0.54 per share reflecting an increase of 10 percent over the previous quarter's dividend. The quarterly dividend is payable on January 31, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on January 19, 2018.\nOn June 21, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share buy-back plan. Under the plan, which became effective on September 1, 2016, the Company is authorized to acquire up to $75.0 million of its outstanding shares through August 31, 2018. The timing and amount of repurchases are based on terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable thereto. During the period from September 1, 2016 through November 30, 2017, the Company repurchased 328,823 shares at a total cost of $35.0 million under this $75.0 million plan.\nFiscal Year 2018 Updated Guidance\nThe Company has updated its net income and diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect its recent adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation:\nNet sales growth is projected to be between 4 and 6 percent with net sales expected to be between $396 million and $403 million. Gross margin percentage for the full year is expected to be near 56 percent. Advertising and promotion investments are projected to be near 6.0 percent of net sales. Net income is projected to be between $54.4 million and $55.3 million. Diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $3.91 and $3.98 based on an estimated 13.9 million weighted average shares o"}

REUTERS\/Thomas White\/Illustration\/File Photo The regulations, jointly issued by the People\u2019s Bank of China and China\u2019s banking, securities and insurance regulators, come as Beijing launches a series of co-ordinated initiatives across government agencies designed to reduce leverage in the financial system.\nUnder the new rules, published on the central bank\u2019s website, institutions must sign written deals when conducting bond repurchase or bond forward transactions. Any deals designed to dodge regulatory requirements are to be banned.\nThe rules order financial institutions to report financial data to regulators if their outstanding repurchase agreements, known as repos, and reverse repo volumes exceed a certain limit.\nA version of the rules seen by Reuters earlier on Thursday and confirmed to be authentic by three sources was dated Dec. 29. The document posted on the PBOC\u2019s website did not include a specific date but carried the year 2017.\nChina is escalating a campaign to reduce excessive leverage in the banking system that threatens financial stability.\nIn November, Beijing formally set up its State Council Financial Stability and Development Committee to strengthen financial supervision. In the same month, the central bank drafted sweeping rules to tighten supervision of the country\u2019s $9 trillion asset management industry to curb shadow banking.\n\u201cAll these measures are aimed at deleveraging, and preventing systemic risks in the financial industry, after years of aggressive expansion by financial institutions,\u201d said Zhang Zibing, chief investment officer at Shanghai-based asset manager Bona Capital.\n\u201cBanks must change their mentality, both in their growth models, and in how they allocate their assets,\u201d Zhang said, adding he expects bond yields to remain elevated this year.\nYields of China\u2019s benchmark 10-year government bonds climbed steadily in 2017, and on Thursday hovered around the highest level in three years, at 3.937 percent.\nBy publishing the rules, regulators are seeking to avoid a repeat of the $2.4 billion bond scandal involving Chinese brokerage Sealand Securities in late 2016, which triggered panic across the country\u2019s financial markets.\nAlthough Sealand Securities blamed \u201cforged\u201d bond agreements, analysts largely pointed to a popular practice called \u201cdaichi\u201d, which is Chinese for \u201cpledged financing\u201d and works in a similar manner to repo agreements, although such transactions are made through informal, oral agreements.\nThe new rules would effectively terminate the practice, which traders have used to keep increased leverage off the regulatory radar.\nThey would also restrict leverage by setting a cap on repo or reserve transactions, tools which help some institutions channel short-term borrowings into longer-term assets for profit.\nFor deposit-taking institutions, if the outstanding volume of such transactions exceeds 80 percent of their net assets, they need to report their financial data to regulators.\nThe cap is 120 percent for securities firms, fund houses and futures brokerages. For insurers, the limit is set at 20 percent of their total assets.\nThe rules called on bond market participants to reasonably control leverage ratios on bond trading and strictly abide by liquidity, leverage and ratio requirements.\nReporting by Shanghai Newsroom, Samuel Shen and Beijing monitoring team; Editing by Richard Borsuk, Sam Holmes and Nick Macfie\n "}

Now, Tesla expects to reach the target by the end of the second quarter.\nTesla said it delivered 29,870 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2017, including 1,550 of its anticipated Model 3 sedan. \nThe California-based electric-car maker also delivered 15,200 Model S sedans, and 13,120 Model X SUVs.\nThat compares with 22,200 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2016, of which 12,700 were Model S and 9,500 were Model X. Total 2016 deliveries were roughly 76,230. There were no Model 3 deliveries in 2016, as the car was not in production yet.\nIn addition to those deliveries, Tesla said there were 2,520 Model S and X vehicles and 860 Model 3 vehicles in transit to customers at the end of the quarter, which Tesla will count as deliveries in Q1 2018. \nTesla said it made \"major progress\" toward addressing the \"production bottlenecks\" the company blamed for falling so far short of its Model 3 targets in the third quarter. \nTesla had said at the end of the third quarter it would deliver about 100,000 Model S and X vehicles in 2017, a 31 percent increase over the previous year. CEO Elon Musk said he expected weekly Model 3 production to be \"in the thousands\" by the end of 2017. \nWall Street estimates varied widely. In a note sent Tuesday, Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne estimated a Wall Street consensus 4,000-5,000 Model 3 deliveries in the fourth quarter . But Osborne's own forecast was below that at just 2,250. Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch had expected Tesla to deliver just 800 Model 3 cars.\n\"In the 12-month investable time frame our rating contemplates, we see Tesla as a great company led by a true visionary, but must acknowledge the asymmetric risk\/reward profile for the stock at the market's current valuation,\" Osborne said in the note. \"Simply, we see a lot more that can go wrong than can go right as the company transitions into Mr. Musk's greater vision as laid out in his Master Plan, Part Deux.\""}

The enhanced compensation is worth of more than $250 million, the company said.

French President Emmanuel Macron delivers his New Year wishes to members of the diplomatic corps at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, January 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Yoan Valat\/Pool \nTwitter users have propelled \u201cInventYourFakeNews\u201d to a top trending topic, opposition lawmakers warn of a risk to civil liberties and experts say a law might not be the best tool. \nMacron\u2019s announcement Wednesday was the latest attempt by a government to find ways to handle the worldwide spread of disinformation on social media -- \u201cfake news\u201d, as U.S. President Donald Trump calls it. \nHis plan would allow judges to block a website or a user account, in particular during an election, and oblige internet platforms to publish the names of those behind sponsored contents. That raises more questions than answers, critics said. \n\u201cOnly authoritarian regimes try to control what the truth is,\u201d said senior conservative senator Bruno Retailleau. Freedom of expression carries risks, but that\u2019s better \u201cthan the temptation to control minds,\u201d he said. \nTwitter users in France made up their own fake news with the hashthag #InventeDesFakeNews (or InventYourFakeNews), which ranged from seeing corporate executives donate money to cut France\u2019s debt load to seeing dead singers alive. Meanwhile, Macron\u2019s opponents across the political spectrum slammed the plan. \n\u201cIs France still a democracy if it muzzles its citizens? This is very worrying!\u201d National Front leader Marine Le Pen said on Twitter. \nAttempts to regulate speech online walk a fine line, which critics says can amount to censorship. A similar law in Germany led authorities to briefly block a satirical magazine\u2019s Twitter account on Wednesday after it parodied anti-Muslim comments. \nMajor internet platforms Facebook and Google declined to comment directly on Macron\u2019s announcement, instead pointing out initiatives where they attempt to self-regulate or cooperate with local media, including in France, to track fake news. \n\u201cAny regulation should be thought through together with the industry,\u201d internet legislation lawyer Christelle Coslin said. She noted that an 1881 law already allows prosecution for the publication of fake information. It would be crucial, she said, to make sure that any ruling by a judge would be technically enforceable. \n\u201cThe real question is who can say what is a true or fake information?\u201d, Coslin said. \nMacron has a solid majority in parliament and could get a bill approved without support from the opposition. \nConcern about fake news arose after accusations of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election in November 2016 and in last year\u2019s French presidential election. Macron\u2019s team complained then that his campaign was targeted by a \u201cmassive and coordinated\u201d hacking operation. \nThe European Commission has opened a wide-ranging consultation on how to cope with fake news; its results are expected in the coming months.

A Saudi money changer displays Saudi Riyal banknotes at a currency exchange shop in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia July 27, 2017.

Pensioners and soldiers will also be given bonuses, while the government will bear the cost of VAT in some situations, such as the first purchase of a home. \nAlawwad also repeated previous government statements indicating Riyadh would spend 30 billion riyals this year on the Citizens Account, a household allowance scheme designed to reduce the impact of austerity policies on low and middle-income Saudi families. \nSaudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, roughly doubled domestic gasoline prices last week as part of reforms aimed at diversifying its economy. A 5 percent VAT on a broad range of goods and services came into effect on the same day. \nPrivate economists have estimated the government will raise about 40 billion riyals in 2018 through VAT. The government did not announce how much money it expected to make from the gasoline price hike, but previous statements by officials have suggested it would be in the tens of billions of riyals. \nA state budget plan released last month projected a deficit of 195 billion riyals, or 7.3 percent of gross domestic product, in 2018. The budget appeared to assume an average oil price of about $55 a barrel; Brent crude is now around $67, so Riyadh may be able to afford the royal handouts without any damage to its finances.

(\"S.T.Stent\"), a portfolio company of The Trendlines Group Ltd. (\"Trendlines\") (SGX: 42T; OTCQX: TRNLY), announced today that it received regulatory clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its composite sinus stent.\nMillions of people worldwide suffer from chronic sinusitis 1 , an inflammation of the sinuses caused by infection or allergy and characterized by facial pain and pressure, nasal congestion, and headaches. When drug treatments are ineffective, Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) is often performed to increase airflow within the nose and sinuses, improve drainage, and remove diseased tissue. However, up to 30% of these surgeries are unsuccessful due to scarring and recurrent inflammation that closes the nasal openings and requires revision surgery. S.T.Stent took on the challenge of developing a solution to dramatically reduce the number of revision surgeries performed.\nS.T.Stent, founded in 2013, developed a removable stent to be placed after the FESS surgery -- that keeps the sinus cavity open for up to 28 days, long enough for the sinus tissue to heal. Stent removal is a minimally invasive procedure performed in the doctor's office, without the need for anesthesia. The stent improves patient outcomes and reduces the probability of revision surgeries. In addition to chronic sinusitis, the stent can be used for nose job failures, chronic allergic rhinitis, and as a direct stenting as an alternative to sinuplasty.\n\"Following excellent results in our clinical trials performed on 30 patients earlier in 2017, we are extremely pleased to have received regulatory clearance from the FDA. This is a significant milestone for S.T.Stent which will allow us to market our product in the U.S.,\" remarked Joseph Flomenbilt, Ph.D., CEO of S.T.Stent.\nChairman and CEO of The Trendlines Group, Steve Rhodes adds: \"We are very proud of the progress that the S.T.Stent team has made towards bringing their truly innovative sinus stent to market. We look forward to following their progress in improving patient outcomes and reducing surgeries in a market seeking a solution to this common problem.\"\nS.T.Stent Chairman, Zeev Bronfeld commented, \"With one patent issued and two pending, followed by FDA clearance, the Company is well-positioned for commercialization.

{"published":"2018-01-04T18:59:00.000+02:00","title":"Married heart patients more likely than singles to survive","text":"(Reuters Health) - People with heart disease have better long-term survival odds when they are married, a recent U.S. study suggests.\nCompared to divorced, widowed and never-married peers, who were up to 71 percent more likely to die during a follow-up of several years, married patients also had fewer heart risk factors like high blood pressure and were more likely to be on heart medications.\n\u201cWe measured biomarkers including cholesterol, high blood pressure and presence of diabetes. True, unmarried patients are dying more because they have these conditions. But just the marital status in and of itself is an independent risk factor,\u201d senior study author Dr. Arshed Quyyumi of Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta told Reuters in a phone interview.\nQuyyumi and his team looked at the relationship between marital status and incidence of cardiovascular death, heart attack and death from any cause in 6,051 men and women who had their clogged heart arteries cleared at Emory Healthcare hospitals between 2003 and 2015. Follow-up ranged from 1.7 to 6.7 years, averaging about three and a half years.\nOverall, the unmarried patients were 1.45 times as likely as the married patients to experience a cardiovascular event leading to death, 1.52 times as likely to have a heart attack and 1.24 times as likely to die from any cause during the follow-up period, the researchers report in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\nWidows fared the worst, with a 71 percent higher likelihood of heart attack or cardiovascular death compared to married patients. Divorced, separated and never-married patients had about 40 percent higher odds for those events.\nPast research has found that being married is associated with better health and survival overall, the study team notes, although the mechanisms involved need further study.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a culmination of factors,\u201d said Dr. Rahul Potluri of Aston Medical School in Birmingham, UK, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cBenefits of marriage include the impetus to look after one\u2019s health. There\u2019s an increased likelihood to seek and obtain healthcare for the detection of chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. Keeping away from smoking due to a \u2018nagging partner\u2019 can also play a role,\u201d he said.\nPeople with a spouse tend to have a greater purpose in life and are more likely to take responsibility for their health through diet, exercise and medication adherence, Quyyumi noted. But when a significant other is no longer in the picture, compliance starts to slip.\nOther possible explanations for the apparent protective effects of marriage include a lack of social support combined with acute stresses that come with divorce, extended bereavement followed by the loss of a loved one and the reduced interaction that comes with living alone, he said.\nA lack of social support has been thought to worsen outcomes in cardiac patients after divorce, Quyyumi said, suggesting that the emotional and financial stress of divorce may play a role in adverse outcomes.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s important to remember that divorce comes in different shades,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag. For some it is stressful, but for many it can be a relief. Interestingly, previous studies have demonstrated that remarriage may attenuate the increased risk of a cardiac event often observed after divorce.\u201d\nIn the widowed group, it may have to do with psychological and behavioral events that accompany life\u2019s course.\n\u201cSome people give up after the loss of a spouse. Bereavement shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly and people who find themselves sick and alone must be aware that they are at a greater risk of a secondary cardiovascular occurrence, or worse, death,\u201d Quyyumi said.\n\u201cWe obviously cannot prescribe marriage to patients,\u201d Potluri said. \u201cBut we can emphasize the role of relationships and friendships in managing coronary artery disease.\u201d\n\u201cTry to regain a sense of purpose,\u201d Quyyumi said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s finding another partner to compensate for the social support one has lost, becoming more involved in your children\u2019s family or finding a church group. These things all help a patient to once again become more interested in saving their own life.\u201d\nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2CF8k3s Journal of the American Heart Association, online December 20, 2017.\n "}

Indeed, 45 percent of parents said in-state tax incentives were a factor in their 529 plan selection, according to a survey from Strategic Insight. \nBut as convenient as it may be to invest in your state's plan just for the tax break, experts actually warn against it. \nOther factors matter, too, especially now that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act allows families to tap a 529 plan to cover up to $10,000 in private elementary and high school expenses each year. As of Sept. 30, 2017, these plans held $282.2 billion in assets, Strategic Insight found. \"Deductions are great, but they may not be worth anything if your state's plan charges a lot of fees.\" -Jonah Gruda, Mazars USA \nImportant to note: You can choose any state's plan . There is no requirement that you invest in your home state's 529 plan. \nFamilies residing in states that have no income tax, that don't offer a deduction for contributions, or that give a tax break regardless of whether investors choose the home state's plan, all have good reasons to look elsewhere. So may families whose state offers a break on contributions, but has high plan fees. \n\"Deductions are great, but they may not be worth anything if your state's plan charges a lot of fees,\" said Jonah Gruda, a certified public accountant and partner at Mazars USA in New York. \n\"If there's no tax incentive, then find the plan that's the cheapest and has the most investment options,\" he said. \"Those two are the biggest factors.\" \nHere's what to think about. Investment management \nFull exposure to the stock market \u2014 especially when it's hitting new highs every day \u2014 probably isn't appropriate if your child is two years away from starting college. But it might make sense to take that risk if you're just opening an account for your six-month-old child and you have 18 years to let your savings grow. \nGenerally, 529 plans offer age-based portfolios, which start off with high equity exposure early on in a child's life and then become more bond-centric and conservative as the college start date approaches. Tom Merton | Getty Images \nSome portfolios slash their equity exposure by 20 to 25 percent in one day as they move toward more conservative allocations, said Leo Acheson, a senior analyst at Morningstar. Such moves are risky if they occur when the market is plummeting. \n\"In the past you had these big step-downs in equity exposure, but more plans are smoothing their exposure to stocks and bonds and making it gradual,\" said Acheson. \nIf you're using your 529 plan to cover private K-12 costs, take a second look at your asset allocation: A shorter time frame may call for less equity risk. Fees \nIf you're spending less money on account fees and fund costs, then more of your contribution is actually being invested. \nCosts you may cover include enrollment and maintenance fees, as well as fund expenses. Investment expenses can vary sharply from one plan to the next. \nConsider that costs for the age-based portfolios in the Utah Educational Savings Plan range from 0.17 percent to 0.60 percent, while the NJ Best 529 College Savings Plan has fees between 0.41 percent and 0.91 percent. Advisor-sold or direct \nYou can't address costs without considering advisor-sold plans versus direct-sold plans. \nAs families become more fee-conscious , an increasing number of 529 assets are flowing toward 529 plans you can purchase directly \u2014 that is, without the aid of a financial advisor. (See chart below.) \nIt varies as to whether the advisor's guidance is worth a commission or a separate fee for planning. \n\"Direct-sold plans are simpler generally because you have a direct investor buying the index,\" said Acheson of Morningstar. \n\"Advisor-sold plans tend to have more active underlying managers and higher fees,\" he said. \nWhen shopping for a 529 plan, be sure to compare advisor-sold plans to one another and direct-sold plans to one another, Acheson said. (See charts below for Morningstar's top 10 direct-sold and advisor-sold plans.) Direct-Sold Plans"}

Each month for two years he would receive 560 euros (roughly $670) from the government, tax-free. He was free to spend the money however he liked. \n\"I'm not accustomed to that kind of bureaucratic freedom,\" Ruusunen said. Benjamin Hall | CNBC Mika Ruusunen was selected to participate in Finland's universal basic income trial. Less bureaucracy, more flexibility \nReducing bureaucracy in the welfare system is one of the main aims of the universal basic income trial in Finland. The government is testing whether basic income is a more flexible policy than existing welfare programs for providing assistance and work incentives to an evolving workforce. \n\"It is assumed that this would be a policy that could activate people through different mechanisms and, well, we want to find out if that's the case,\" said Miska Simanainen, a researcher at Kela, the government organization overseeing the trial. \nFinland's universal basic income experiment launched January 1, 2017 and will run until the end of 2018. Official results from the trial won't be released until it concludes. Experts said it's not surprising the Nordic country known for its generous welfare benefits, like universal free education, is at the forefront of a new economic experiment. \n\"We have had political discussions on basic income for many years, actually, for a couple of decades in Finland,\" Simanainen said. \nThe idea of free money has become more popular in recent years thanks to advocates in Silicon Valley like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. They see universal basic as a cushion for workers whose jobs might be replaced by automation or robots. Advocates argue free money could provide workers with flexibility to retrain for a new career, pursue creative interests, or start their own business. show chapters 1:49 AM ET Thu, 28 Dec 2017 | 04:22 \nA key goal of the Finland experiment is to give unemployed people incentive to work by providing them with financial assistance even once they're employed. Researchers chose the 560-euro monthly amount because it roughly equals the current level of unemployment benefits. \n\"One main idea behind this version of basic income that we are testing is that it would replace the basic social benefits or at least basic unemployment benefits,\" Simanainen said. A 'win-win situation' \nTrial participant Mika Ruusunen had been unemployed for 16 months before he decided to go back to school to retrain for a career in IT. He had just landed an internship at a tech company when he found out he was selected for the experiment. \nRuusunen will continue to receive the free money each month even now that the company has hired him as a full-time worker. \n\"Before I get my current job I was already thinking about starting my own enterprise, and it's nice to know that I have still that option,\" he said. \"The basic income encourages people to do work, even [a] part-time job or lower income positions. It's kind of a win-win situation for society.\" \nBut not everyone in Finland sees the basic income experiment as win-win, especially if it encourages workers to accept low-wage work. Benjamin Hall | CNBC Finland is conducting a national experiment testing universal basic income. \n\"Our path shouldn't be to create low-wage jobs but to really improve education and to improve people's skills,\" said Antti Jauhiainen, author of the Finnish book \"The Welfare State Strikes Back.\" \nJauhiainen favors universal basic income but sees it as an added benefit versus a replacement for the current welfare system. He said that by targeting a small set of unemployed individuals, the trial is the \"wrong approach to a hugely important idea.\" \nRuusunen agreed the trial should be expanded beyond people who are unemployed for it to be a true universal basic income. He's optimistic the idea will have a prominent place in Finland's future. \n\"I think that about 100 years from now the people will see basic income as the same kind of thing as a universal suffrage,\" he said. \"I'm actually very proud that Finland was one of the first countries where it was tested.\""}

FILE PHOTO: Jia Yueting, co-founder and head of Le Holdings Co Ltd, also known as LeEco and formerly as LeTV, poses for a photo in front of a logo of his company after a Reuters interview at LeEco headquarters in Beijing, China April 22, 2016. REUTERS\/Jason Lee\/File Photo \nGan Wei, who has been entrusted by the founder Jia Yueting to exercise shareholder rights at LeEco\u2019s listed units and to handle asset sales, said on her official Weibo account on Sunday that the debt and interest payments owed to China Merchants Bank had amounted to HK$1.4 billion. \nLeEco has repaid part of this debt after selling shares in its smartphone affiliate Coolpad Group, Gan said. \nThe entertainment, electronics and electric vehicles group has struggled to pay its debts after rapid expansion into multiple sectors sparked a cash crunch and a plunge in the shares of a listed unit - smart TV firm Leshi Internet Information and Technology Corp. At its peak LeEco owed creditors 10 billion yuan. \nChina Merchants Bank applied in July to have some of LeEco\u2019s assets frozen, saying a LeEco unit, Leview Mobile HK Limited, had been late making interest payments on a loan. \nIn a letter published last week, Jia referred to the loan as one of the key causes of the cash-flow problems. \n\u201cOur next step is to actively seek communication with China Merchants Bank with the hope that we can get some of our frozen assets proportionately released so that we can repay more of our debts. We hereby request China Merchants Bank to understand and support us\u201d, Gan said in the post. \nChina Merchants did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nCoolpad on Friday said its top shareholder Leview Mobile HK Ltd had reduced its stake to 10.95 percent from 28.78 percent by selling shares to Power Sun Ventures Limited. \nGan also said 929 million yuan worth of assets had been transferred from LeEco\u2019s e-commerce subsidiary LeMall to another of its core listed unit\u2019s Tianjin-based subsidiaries, New Leshi Smart Home, to pay off some debts. The firm said last week that it was trying to get 3 billion yuan worth of funding. \nFounder Jia was placed on an official blacklist of debt defaulters in early December, a move taken by Chinese courts to put pressure on people and entities to repay debts, and was ordered by regulators to return to the country before the end of 2017 to address the mounting debt pile linked to his firms. \nBut Jia defied the order to return, saying he needed to stay in the United States as a fundraising for his electric car business was making progress. He empowered his wife and brother, Jia Yuemin, to act on his behalf. \n($1 = 7.8199 Hong Kong dollars) Reporting by Brenda Goh; Additional Reporting by Shu Zhang in BEIJING; Editing by Himani Sarkar"}

It expected more frequent extreme events in future. \n\u201cWe have a new normal,\u201d said Ernst Rauch, head of Munich Re\u2019s Corporate Climate Centre, which monitors climate change risks. \n\u201c2017 was not an outlier,\u201d he said, noting insured losses have surpassed $100 billion multiple times since 2005. \u201cWe must have on our radar the trend of new magnitudes.\u201d \nLast year\u2019s hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the United States and Caribbean, wildfires in California and earthquakes in Mexico destroyed homes, infrastructure and numerous lives. \nThe disasters also rocked global insurers. Munich Re and Hannover Re both issued profit warnings. \nThat dealt a blow to a sector already struggling with thin margins, stiff competition and falling prices. \nMunich Re\u2019s tally for the industry comes on the back of other estimates that underscored the severity of 2017. \nIn December, Swiss Re estimated global insured losses from catastrophes would hit $136 billion in 2017, the third-highest on record for the sector, with the United States hardest hit. That figure is not directly comparable to Munich Re\u2019s estimates as it includes man-made disasters. \nReinsurers, which are in the business of insuring insurance, are experts in managing risk and rarely get caught off guard. Analysts have said reinsurers may need to take a fresh look at their risk models as the planet warms and storms become more intense. \nA big question for the industry has been whether the run of catastrophes would allow them to achieve higher prices for their coverage, which have been in decline for years. \nEarly indications suggest modest increases. Global property reinsurance prices rose less than expected in the key Jan. 1 renewal season, with strong competition limiting increases to single digit percentages, brokers said this week. \nA turnaround in prices would be the first major reversal since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

If Simonds is picked, the chamber would be split 50-50 and force lawmakers into a rare power-sharing arrangement. \nA recount had shown that Simonds won the Nov. 7 election by one vote, but a three-judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for Yancey. Simonds filed a lawsuit asking the judges to reconsider the decision. \nOn Wednesday, the judges said the Democrat had failed to show their previous ruling was in error or unjust. \n\u201cThe manifest injustice against which we must always guard is the chance that a single vote may not be counted,\u201d the panel said in an 11-page ruling. \nAn image filed in court showed that the disputed ballot had bubbles filled in beside both candidates, with a slash mark by Simonds\u2019 name. \nThe tied race in the 94th District came amid Democrats\u2019 historic gains in Virginia\u2019s statehouse elections in November. They were part of the party\u2019s first big wave of political victories since Republican Donald Trump won the White House in 2016. \nSimonds called on Yancey to agree not to challenge the results of Thursday\u2019s drawing. After Yancey responded by saying he would follow the process laid out in state law, Simonds told reporters late Wednesday that \u201call options are on the table\u201d if she loses the drawing. \n\u201cI am not prepared to give up,\u201d she said. \nOfficials are under pressure to resolve the issue with the legislature set to convene on Jan. 10 and elect a speaker. Republicans hold a majority in the state Senate, and Democrat Ralph Northam is set to be sworn in as governor on Jan. 13. \nA second House race also remains in dispute.

Merkel starts over with coalition talks Madeline Chambers 6 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel, weakened by an election setback in September, launches a second bid to build a coalition government on Sunday when she sits down with the Social Democrats (SPD) for exploratory talks. German acting Chancellor Angela Merkel poses for photographs after the television recording of her annual New Year's speech at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, December 30, 2017. REUTERS\/Hannibal Hanschke \nA re-run of her \u2018grand coalition\u2019 with the SPD, in power from 2013 to 2017, appears the best option for conservative Merkel is as it would provide stability in what would be her fourth term. \nBut with success far from guaranteed, there are a range of other possible scenarios. \nAfter her conservatives bled support to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the Sept. 24 national election, Merkel saw her authority undermined two months later by the collapse of three-way coalition talks with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens. \nThat shifted her focus back to the SPD, but the centre-left party is wary of another tie-up with Merkel after voters punished it for four years of power-sharing in the September vote, when its support slumped to its lowest level since 1933. \nThe consensus among politicians and commentators is that the talks will last at least until March. \nAlthough the current caretaker government under Merkel is keeping things ticking over, investors fear that protracted talks will delay what they view as necessary reforms in Europe\u2019s biggest economy and the bloc as a whole. \nAfter a flow of leaks, tweets and selfies emanating from last year\u2019s three-way coalition talks undermined trust, this time around participants have agreed to a news blackout during negotiations. \nHere are the main scenarios: GRAND COALITION OF CONSERVATIVES, SPD \nThe most likely outcome, given that the two camps have ruled together for eight of the 12 years Merkel has been chancellor and broadly agree on foreign and security policy. However, with both blocs struggling to stem a fall in support, it is by no means a done deal. \nThey are at odds on a range of issues, from tax to healthcare and Europe. The SPD wants a wholesale reform of health insurance to end what it describes as a two-tier system. Conservatives oppose this idea and are more sceptical than the SPD on plans for deeper EU integration. \nMigrant policy is likely to be one of the trickiest issues as Germany struggles to integrate the more than 1.6 million asylum seekers who have arrived since the start of 2015. \nBavaria\u2019s Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party to Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU), has called for benefit cuts for asylum seekers and wants limits on family members joining refugees in Germany - anathema to the SPD. \nOffering the greatest degree of stability, this tie-up is Merkel\u2019s favoured option but many SPD members are wary. The party had promised to go into opposition after its worst election result since 1933. \nThe SPD leadership, worried about internal splits, seems certain to make tough demands and has stressed that the outcome of talks is open. It is offering members a vote on Jan. 21 after \u2018exploratory\u2019 talks before leaders start official coalition negotiations. Outgoing Bavarian state premier and leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU) Horst Seehofer, Alexander Dobrindt of the Christian Social Union (CSU) and Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban arrive for a statement after a CSU party meeting at 'Kloster Seeon' in Seeon, Germany, January 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Michaela Rehle \n\u2018KOKO\u2019 COOPERATION DEAL BETWEEN CONSERVATIVES, SPD \nMooted by sceptics of a grand coalition in the SPD, the centre-left party would work with Merkel in some areas including the budget and European and foreign affairs but force her to find ad-hoc parliamentary majorities for other policies. \nWhile this is more palatable to many SPD members, many senior conservatives have rejected the idea outright, rendering it unlikely. MINORITY GOVERNMENT UNDER MERKEL \nThis would be a post-war first for a country that craves political stability - a result of the fragmentation in the years that preceded the rise of Hitler\u2019s Nazi party. \nNevertheless, some Social Democrats prefer this option, which would allow them to oppose Merkel\u2019s policies and force her to seek parliamentary majorities on individual laws. It would also be likely to hasten the end of her political career. NEW ELECTIONS \nSome conservatives, including Merkel, have said they would prefer new elections to a minority government. \nThis scenario would also throw Merkel\u2019s future into doubt. She has indicated she could stand again and, while the absence of an obvious successor makes her the most likely candidate, her personal ratings are on the wane. \nAs far as the parties go, opinion polls indicate there have been no big swings since the September election. A GMS survey this week put the conservative bloc on 32 percent, unchanged from the previous week, the SPD was down 1 point at 20 percent and AfD up 1 point at 14 percent. \nGermany\u2019s President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who would have to get involved if no coalition deal was agreed, has made clear he wants to avoid new elections if possible. \n\u2018JAMAICA\u2019 COALITION OF CONSERVATIVES, FDP, GREENS \nThere is little appetite for a re-run of talks on this nationally untested three-way alliance, dubbed \u2018Jamaica\u2019 because the parties\u2019 colours match those of the Jamaican flag. \nDivergences on policies from Europe to tax and migration were clear during the weeks of talks that descended into acrimony last year before collapsing. \nHowever, some in the FDP - which was responsible for the breakdown of talks in November - have left the door open to another try if all other efforts at forming a government fail. OTHER OPTIONS \nSome experts have pointed to the possibility of an alliance between the conservatives and Greens - easier to agree than a three-way deal with the FDP. This could get a degree of backing on some policies from the SPD. However, this seems an unlikely option and would be unstable. Reporting by Madeline Chambers; editing by John Stonestreet"}

The tech company has been working with Fiat Chrysler since 2016 to outfit its Chrysler Pacifica minivans with autonomous technology. Waymo plans to launch a fully autonomous ride-hailing service early next year in Phoenix, Arizona. \nIn a statement, Volkswagen said the self-driving technology can be integrated over time across the automaker\u2019s brands and in different product categories, whether self-driving pods, shuttles, delivery vans or self-driving trucks. \nFor Hyundai, Aurora\u2019s technology will be incorporated into custom-developed models and tested in markets including China. Hyundai said the first model to be used in testing will be its latest generation fuel-cell vehicle, debuting at the CES technology conference in Las Vegas next week. \nUnder the alliance, Hyundai plans to commercialise level 4 autonomous vehicles - which can operate without human input or oversight under select conditions - in unidentified \u201cpilot smart cities\u201d by 2021. \nThis is the first announcement on a self-driving technology partnership by the South Korean carmaker, which has traditionally shunned tie-ups in favour of developing technology in-house.

Reuters Staff 5 Min Read \nHANOI, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Vietnam brought 22 executives to court over losses at the state oil firm on Monday, in the most important trial of a widening crackdown on corruption. Among those being tried was the first politburo member to be arrested in decades. \nIn a separate trial in Ho Chi Minh City, a banking fraud case began with 46 defendants. \nAs well as shedding light on graft, mismanagement and nepotism within state firms at a time privatisation is accelerating, the arrests show the ascendancy of a more conservative faction within the ruling Communist Party. \nHow many people are involved? \nScores have been arrested across PetroVietnam and the banking sector. Some have been tried and sentenced already. The most senior figure arrested is former PetroVietnam Chairman Dinh La Thang, among those whose trial started on Monday. Neither he nor his lawyer was available for comment. Germany has accused Vietnam of kidnapping one PetroVietnam suspect, Trinh Xuan Thanh, who was also among the 22 in court. More than 100 other officials are also under threat of prosecution or have been demoted or fired. In another case linked to the corruption crackdown, a Vietnamese tycoon was arrested last week after being sent home from Singapore. \nWhat is PetroVietnam? \nPetroVietnam is a tangled enterprise of 15 direct units, 18 subsidiaries and 46 affiliates in which it owns smaller stakes. Hundreds of millions of dollars in losses have been racked up at units ranging from banks to construction firms and power plants to textile mills. \nThe scandals at PetroVietnam are connected to the banking sector through a deal in which the oil firm lost $35 million in an investment in Ocean Bank. The lender\u2019s former chief executive - a previous PetroVietnam chairman - was sentenced to death. \nWhat does the crackdown mean politically? \nIt shows a concerted effort to rein in large-scale corruption through which some officials had secured massive personal wealth and tarnished the ruling party\u2019s image. \nBut it has also allowed the current Communist Party leadership to strengthen its hand under General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong after winning out in a power struggle with former prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung last year. \nWhether or not the arrests go even higher, Trong\u2019s supremacy is assured through a term that lasts until 2021 and the faction is better placed to maintain its dominance even beyond. \nWhat divides the different groups in the ruling party? \nAlthough the party presents a public image of unity, there are diverse views on everything from the pace and openness of reforms to Vietnam\u2019s delicate diplomatic balancing between China, the United States and other powers. \nWhat best characterises the current leadership is conservatism in preserving the party\u2019s absolute authority in close alignment with the security establishment. \nIt marks a change of style from the leadership under Dung and his allies, some of whom emerged as personalities in their own right and shown signs of readiness for greater political openness. \nAlongside the corruption arrests, Vietnam has also arrested more bloggers, activists and other critics this year than in any other since a 2011 crackdown on youth activists. \nHow popular is the corruption crackdown? \nFew tears are shed in Vietnam over the arrests of former officials, but there is also scepticism over the real motives. The day-to-day corruption of low-level officials and police is still a factor of Vietnamese life. \nWhat impact has this had on PetroVietnam? \nPetroVietnam\u2019s net profit margin in 2016 was its lowest in at least seven years at just over 7 percent from over 15 percent in 2009. The company told Reuters the oil price was the biggest factor, but it has also said failed projects, wrongdoing by officials and the investigations themselves had an impact. \nPetroVietnam\u2019s shares are not listed on a stock exchange, but some of its units have underperformed its Thai peer PTT since 2009. \nWhat does this mean for reform and privatisation? \nAlthough the crackdown points to the political strengthening of the party, the leadership has shown less sign of delaying economic reform than the previous administration. \nFacing pressure because of its budget deficit, the government has accelerated plans to sell major stakes in the most attractive assets - including the sale of a majority stake in brewery Sabeco late last year. It is also selling stakes in three units of PetroVietnam. \nSome economic and business analysts believe the fear among officials of being branded corrupt could further hold up bureaucratic decision making in state-run firms and ministries.

Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: helen.reid.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net THOUGHT OF THE DAY: IF 2017 WERE A FUND, IT'D BE IN TROUBLE (1316 GMT) From SocGen's Andrew Lapthorne's research piece \"The year-end numbers from the year volatility died\": \"Not only did global equity markets perform well during 2017 (MSCI World delivered a total return of 20.1%), but they did so with such low volatility and consistency that if this were a fund, it would perhaps merit a visit from the authorities to check exactly what you were up to!\" (Julien Ponthus) DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE FLAT U.S. YIELD CURVE (1240 GMT) \"U.S. recessions have usually occurred after the yield curve has been as flat as it is now, but the lags have typically been long and variable, suggesting that it would be unwise to expect a U.S. recession soon\", says Oxford Economics' Ben May. Here's his chart showing we may yet have time ahead of us before a recession given the limited time the U.S. 10-year yield has been less than 50bp higher than the two-year yield: (Julien Ponthus) MIDDAY UPDATE: EURO ZONE STOCKS SHOOT TO 2-WEEK HIGH (1230 GMT) It looks like the optimism spurred by the PMIs is giving Euro zone indexes a kick higher, with Euro stoxx up more than 1 percent at a 2-week high, and Euro zone blue chips at their highest in a week. Unsurprisingly, it's the cyclical sectors which continue to dominate: construction stocks, autos, banks and big oil. Here's your midday snapshot: (Kit Rees) YES TO CYCLICAL EXPOSURE, BUT EUROPEAN BANKS NOT A SIMPLE 'BUY' (1212 GMT) As the PMIs showed, the economic backdrop in Europe is strong and, along with other factors, suggests that now is the time to get some cyclical exposure, says UBS. European banks could be a candidate, given that they look cheap relative to the market. But UBS argues it's not as straightforward as that. \"Top down arguments around European macro recovery and rising rates are persuasive but look played out we think in (banking) stocks most geared to these trends,\" UBS analysts wrote in a note. \"If equity markets don't go higher, owning cheaper stocks will have been the righ call,\" UBS adds. (Kit Rees) LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE TO CORRECT? (1115 GMT) A December survey of 54 institutional investors conducted by Managing Partners Group showed that slightly over 7 out of 10 expect a global equity correction of over 10 percent within 18 months. \"Equities are looking highly valued on both sides of the Atlantic and it looks as though the market is just looking for an excuse to correct\", Jeremy Leach, CEO of the investment house commented in the press release presenting the study. That being said, IG's Chris Beauchamp noted in his morning comments that investors were quick to buy the dip which emerged during Europe's first trading days: \"Dip buyers clearly know an opportunity when they see one, and with weakness so widespread across the continent's markets there was an opportunity to pick up some bargains, which at least makes a nice change from chasing the bull run on Wall Street\". (Julien Ponthus) EUROBOOM! (d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu) (1048 GMT) The strong PMI data realeased this morning seems to confirm that the \"Euroboom\" trade is here to stay in 2018. \"We continue to believe that the outlook for European equities is positive, aided by the potential for close to ten percent earnings growth in 2018\", JPMorgan AM's Mike Bell commented. That's in sharp contrast to the likes of SocGen who don't see much \"meat on the bone\" for the old continent's stocks. Actually, thinking about it, the first trading days of the year are starting with a \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\" feeling with regard to the dynamics of the bulls : global synchronised growth anyone? To read how the Euro zone economy's posted its best growth in seven years click And here's a celebratory kiss: (Julien Ponthus) PAY DAY FOR DEBENHAMS SHORTS (1013 GMT) Yesterday's rise in Next and other retailers sure tested the conviction of investors who have shorted the likes of Debenhams for months in the hope of a downfall. With its profit warning triggering a fall of over 16 percent today to its worst price since the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, Debenhams, which is the second most-shorted stock on the FTSE, is delivering for speculators. Note that brokers such as Investec think things could still get worse, with the latter cutting its target price to 28 pence, below its already depressed level of 29.88 pence. According to Reuters calculations, Debenhams\u2019 share price fall netted profits of around 12 million pounds on Thursday for hedge funds which have short positions totalling 14.3 percent of the company's stock. You can see how much Debenhams has fallen here: (Julien Ponthus and Alasdair Pal) EUROPEAN AUTOS CRUISE TO TWO-MONTH PEAK (0930 GMT) The European autos sector has had a strong start to the year, up 1.2 percent this morning at a two-month peak. Today's move is being driven by yesterday's U.S. auto sales data for December. While not stellar, the figures did beat analyst expectations, with the likes of Fiat Chrysler up around 4.1 percent at a record high today. While the autos sector had a tepid first half in 2017, things have really started to pick up over the last six months. Fiat, Porsche and Volkswagen are among the biggest gainers over that period. (Kit Rees) OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPEAN SHARES CLIMB, FTSE HITS FRESH RECORD HIGH (0815 GMT) It's a positive start to the trading session for European equities, with almost all sectors higher. Cyclical sectors, such a financials and commodities, are adding the most to gains, and in turn have pushed Britain's FTSE 100 to a new high. Away from the STOXX 600, Debenhams is down 20 percent. Here's your opening snapshot: (Kit Rees) PRE-OPEN ROUNDUP: WHAT'S ON THE RADAR (0746 GMT) Futures are pointing to a stronger open for European stocks on Thursday after investors\u2019 rising risk appetite drove Asian shares to a 10-year peak and oil prices surged further. Germany\u2019s exporter-heavy DAX is likely to benefit from the U.S. dollar\u2019s recovery and continued strength in cyclicals, and services PMIs today which SocGen analysts forecast will confirm the region\u2019s sustained growth.

The groups together represent more than 450 U.S. hospitals. \nHarrison said on \"Closing Bell\" that the project was spurred by feedback by patients who at times were saying \"they can't get ahold of drugs or they're way too expensive.\" \n\"We're experiencing that in the hospital as well, and we've been thinking about this for a couple of years now,\" Harrison said. \n\"We worked hard to come up with a plan ... now is the time to get to work.\" \nHe said that one of the big problems in the pharmaceuticals market today is that some \"individuals and groups have gone ahead and gotten sole control over a given drug.\" \n\"They create shortages and drive the prices up, and our patients can't get ahold of the drugs we need,\" Harrison said. \n\"We as a team will do the opposite,\" he said. \"We'll make sure drugs are available in good quantities and reasonable prices.\" \nHarrison said the members of the consortium will contribute funds to finance the new drug company. \n\"Over time, the business plan says we'll get our money back,\" he said. \nHarrison also said that he expects the new firm to provide just a small fraction of pharmaceutical products that the hospitals have to purchase. \n\"We expect that the vast majority of drugs we buy will still come in the same channels we have always gotten them,\" he said. \"We think most pharmacies are doing a great job and drug manufacturers are doing a great job.\" \n\"We're only interested in those organizations that are creating shortages and driving drug prices up in an irrational fashion,\" Harrison said.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast home sales falling 2.2 percent to a 5.70 million-unit rate in December from a previously reported 5.81 million-unit pace in November.\nExisting home sales, which account for about 90 percent of U.S. home sales, rose 1.1 percent on a year-on-year basis in December. They increased 1.1 percent to 5.51 million units in 2017, the highest level since 2006.\nThe NAR attributed the sales decline in December, which followed three straight months of gains, to a perennial shortage of houses at the lower end of the market.\nThe number of previously owned homes on the market tumbled 11.4 percent to 1.48 million units in December, the lowest since January 1999 when the Realtors group started tracking the series.

Freestyle skier McRae Williams poses for a portrait at the U.S. Olympic Committee Media Summit in Park City, Utah, U.S. September 26, 2017. He listens to Nas and Mob Deep while training. REUTERS\/Mike Blake \nIn a sport where even teenagers can dominate, Williams\u2019 breakout year did not come until he was 24 when he won the men\u2019s ski slopestyle competition at the 2013 X Games in Tignes, France. \nSince then, he has added two podium finishes and appears to have peaked at just the right time heading into an Olympic season. \nThe previous Winter Games in Sochi came too early in Williams\u2019 blossoming career. But whether he is successful or not in getting to South Korea, the Utah resident says he has already achieved everything he ever dreamed of growing up by competing and winning medals at the X Games. \nSpeaking at Team USA\u2019s training camp in Austria, Williams did say, however, that he was determined to make the most of what may be his only opportunity of adding an Olympic medal to his collection. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t make it in 2014 so it is a big deal and I am 27 so this might be my last shot at it so I am going to give it my all,\u201d said Williams whilst relaxing on a slack line outside the team\u2019s hotel. \nHe added: \u201cAt 27 I am getting nervous.

{"published":"2018-01-08T07:54:00.000+02:00","title":"Trump's First Medical Exam as President Is This Week | Fortune","text":"By Bloomberg 5:54 AM EST \nPresident Donald Trump gets his first physical since taking office on Friday, but Americans may not find out much about the health of the 71-year-old chief executive with a taste for McDonald\u2019s and an aversion to exercise beyond golf. \nTrump, like all Americans, has the right under federal law to keep health information from public disclosure. The White House has pledged, though, that physician Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson will issue a public report on the exam, scheduled for Jan. 12 at Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. \nTrump\u2019s liberal detractors and even some Republicans have recently questioned his fitness for office. A new book on Trump\u2019s White House by author Michael Wolff, Fire and Fury, asserts that almost all of his top staff and advisers believe he is mentally unwell. \nRead: Steve Bannon Apologizes For Controversial Comments About Donald Trump Jr. \nTrump hit back against the claims on Saturday, declaring himself a \u201cvery stable genius.\u201d The White House sent out an army of surrogates on Sunday to forcefully denounce the book book and other speculation about Trump\u2019s fitness to serve. \nThe president himself contrasted his vigor during 2016 with that of his campaign opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. pointing to the former Secretary of State\u2019s fainting spell and a persistent cough as evidence she wasn\u2019t physically fit to be elected. \n\u201cHillary Clinton doesn\u2019t have the fortitude, the strength or stamina to lead in our world,\u201d a narrator said in an ad Trump\u2019s campaign ran in October 2016. Occasional Cigars \nPresidential medical reports are typically brief, with an overview of a few basic metrics \u2014 cholesterol levels, weight, blood pressure \u2014 and may note some idiosyncrasies. In George W. Bush\u2019s first exam as president, his doctor noted he enjoyed the occasional cigar, drank diet soda and ran 12 miles a week. Former President Barack Obama\u2019s exam report chronicled his struggle to quit smoking. \n\u201cThe president\u2019s health isn\u2019t only of importance to the president but to all of us, so we do expect presidents to reveal information that other people don\u2019t have to, just like their financial information,\u201d said David Orentlicher, co-director of the health law program at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Tests Unclear \nIt\u2019s not known if Trump will receive a mental health screening, though the Obama and Bush medical reports noted that exams showed normal neurological function. Jackson didn\u2019t respond to an interview requested through the White House, and a White House spokesman declined to comment. \nSome members of Trump\u2019s own party have raised questions about his psychological fitness for office. Senator Bob Corker has expressed concerns about \u201chis leadership, and just his stability, and the lack of desire to be competent on issues and understand and nothing has changed.\u201d \nStat News, a publication that covers health, reported in May that Trump\u2019s speech had become less articulate in recent years and suggested it could be related to cognitive decline. \u2018Astonishingly Excellent\u2019 \nThe White House announced last month Trump\u2019s plan to have a physical after the president slurred words during a speech announcing the U.S. would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at the time that Trump was simply thirsty and dismissed questions about his health as \u201cridiculous.\u201d \nTrump\u2019s personal doctor, Harold Bornstein, released a letter during the presidential campaign claiming the real estate mogul would be the \u201chealthiest individual ever elected\u201d and that his laboratory tests were \u201castonishingly excellent.\u201d The letter revealed that Trump took a daily aspirin and a low dose of statin, a drug used to lower cholesterol. \nRead: Trump Insists He\u2019s \u2018A Very Stable Genius\u2019 and \u2018Like, Really Smart\u2019 \nPresidents don\u2019t always get glowing reviews from their doctors. When President Bill Clinton had a suspicious mole removed in 2001 and saw an increase in his cholesterol level, his doctor said he wasn\u2019t in as good of shape as he would like, calling his results \u201cfairly normal.\u201d Clinton allowed reporters to question his doctor after the exam; Obama and Bush released written summaries. \nJackson was named physician to the president in 2013 and performed Obama\u2019s last physical in 2014. He had previously worked in the White House medical office treating Cabinet members and senior staff since 2006. Sanders said last month that Jackson will issue a public statement on the president\u2019s health after the exam. Big Macs \nTrump has made no attempt to hide his weakness for unhealthy foods, posting a photo of himself aboard his campaign plane with a bucket of fried chicken, bragging about the chocolate cake at his Mar-a-Lago resort and drinking Diet Coke around the West Wing. Trump would sometimes order two McDonald\u2019s Corp. Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish sandwiches and a chocolate milkshake for dinner, according to a recent book by campaign aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie. \nSeveral past presidents have had major health issues while in office that were kept from the public. A Duke University Medical School study found that half of all presidents through 1974 suffered from mental illness, including bipolar disorder, alcohol abuse and depression. Health Complications \nSince the start of the twentieth century, at least 14 of the 20 presidents prior to Trump suffered from a significant health complication while in office, the full extents of which were kept from the public in some cases, according to another analysis, by Aaron Seth Kesselheim, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School. \nAmong the most prominent was Woodrow Wilson, who suffered a stroke that left him incapacitated, a fact that was kept from his own Cabinet. The doctor for President Dwight Eisenhower, who had a major heart attack and stroke while in office, also withheld the information and misled the public about the extent of his medical problems. \nRead: Donald Trump Tweets That Stock Market Rises Fastest 1,000 in History. Here\u2019s What History Says \nJohn F. Kennedy had several health problems, most notably Addison\u2019s disease, an adrenal gland disorder, which was concealed from the public. \nThe state of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s health was also tightly controlled by the White House, which carefully choreographed media coverage to portray him as robust. \u2018No Obligation\u2019 \n\u201cYou probably are not going to get any bad news out of this,\u201d said Art Caplan, a professor of bioethics at New York University. \u201cJust like when you or I get a physical, it is completely up to you what you release about it. There is no obligation to tell anyone anything.\u201d \nWhile presidents aren\u2019t required to have a physical or release the results, it has become standard practice. In a Gallup poll during the 2016 general election, 51% of Americans said the president should release all relevant medical information, an increase from 2004 when 38% held that view. \nCaplan said the only way Jackson could legally and ethically release information about Trump\u2019s mental state without the president\u2019s consent is if he determined Trump posed a direct, imminent threat to another person, but that is an extremely difficult standard to meet. \n\u201cThe standard is so tough to meet in a physical, I can\u2019t imagine that happening,\u201d Caplan said.

Sales have exceeded initial estimates, on track to beat the lifetime numbers of its predecessor Wii U, leaving suppliers scrambling for parts. \nSwitch console sales will likely hit 15 million units in the year to March and climb to 20 million next year, Nintendo said, fueling hopes of a repeat of the success of the first Wii that debuted in late 2006 and sold more than 100 million units. \n\u201cThe momentum for Switch over the last 10 months has been stronger than that of the Wii,\u201d Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima said at an earnings briefing on Wednesday. \n\u201cThe key to Switch\u2019s success in the second year will be to attract non-gamers,\u201d he added. \nAnalysts believe Nintendo\u2018s plan to launch \u201cLabo,\u201d LEGO-style accessories for the console that kids can build themselves on cardboard sheets, could bring in a younger audience. \n\u201cThis is exactly the kind of crazy idea that Nintendo is known for which we believe will help expand the company\u2019s audience,\u201d analysts at Macquarie wrote in a recent research note. It will be \u201cappealing to younger audience which has not been addressed by Nintendo for some time.\u201d \nNintendo sold 7.2 million Switch consoles in the three months through December and raised its annual sales forecast by a million from an earlier projection of 14 million units. \nThat already exceeds sales of 13.56 million consoles for the Wii U that was on the market from late 2012 through 2017. \n\u201cSwitch sales during the holiday season were stronger than expected in Japan, the United States and Europe,\u201d Kimishima said at the briefing. \nQ3 BLOWS PAST CONSENSUS \nStellar demand for Switch pushed Nintendo\u2018s operating profit up almost four-fold to 116.50 billion yen ($1.07 billion) for the third quarter. This was the highest ever it has earned for the October-December period since 2009. \nThe results beat consensus estimate of around 67 billion yen from six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. \nThe Kyoto-based company raised its profit forecast for the year ending March to 160 billion yen, from 120 billion yen, versus analysts\u2019 estimate of 144 billion yen. \nThe company\u2019s annual profit hit a record high of 555 billion yen in the year to March 2009, driven by Wii sales. \nShares of Nintendo closed up 2% before the quarterly results were announced, versus the wider market that closed down about 1%. \nNintendo, which relies heavily on Switch to drive its earnings, is looking to diversify its revenue sources by moving into new areas such as smartphone gaming and theme parks with its roster of popular characters. \nBut its efforts in smartphone gaming have produced lackluster results. \nIt has released four smartphone titles over the last two years, but recently decided to ditch the first one, a social networking service-style application called Miitomo, due to sluggish demand. \nPokemon GO was a phenomenal success, but Nintendo receives profits only through an affiliate which developed the game with a Google spinoff. \n\u201cThe smartphone business is yet to become a profit pillar for Nintendo,\u201d Kimishima said. \u201cWe still have a lot to do.\u201d SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

The 10 million-bpd milestone previously had not been expected to be reached until the fourth quarter.\nThat would match the all-time monthly record of 10.04 million bpd set in Nov. 1970; oil production declined after that as the United States increasingly relied on imported crude. That has changed in the last several years due to the shale revolution, but these projections surpass earlier expectations.\nThe monthly average for February is expected to surpass 10 million bpd, said Tim Hess, the lead analyst for the report. That will be the first time production has reached that level since 1970.\nOnly Russia and Saudi Arabia have produced more crude, hitting peak output of over 11 million bpd and about 10.7 million bpd respectively in recent years.\nThe EIA revised its production growth forecast for 2018 sharply higher to 970,000 bpd from 780,000 bpd in its previous outlook.\nU.S. output will continue to rise in 2019, surpassing 11 million bpd by the end of that year, the EIA report said. The average production in 2019 will rise 580,000 bpd to 10.85 million bpd, the agency said in its first outlook for next year.\n\u201cThe major risk factors would be more global in nature, rather than anything specific domestically,\u201d EIA acting administrator John Conti said on a conference call. \u201cDomestically, things are lining up in terms of moderate prices and increased opportunity for production.\u201d\nMuch of the production growth will be concentrated in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield stretching across Texas and New Mexico, said John Staub, the EIA director of the office of petroleum, natural gas and biofuels analysis. As a result, pipeline capacity constraints should not be a major limiting factor in starting new production, he said.\nDespite the rising production, oil prices edged higher on Tuesday, with U.S. crude touching its highest since December 2014, closing at $62.96 a barrel.\nThe market was supported by OPEC-led production cuts and expectations that U.S. crude inventories have dropped for an eighth week. Oil traders have closely watched U.S. crude production to see whether output gains from U.S. shale formations will surpass the 1.8 million bpd cuts. [O\/R]\nU.S. demand growth of 150,000 bpd was estimated for 2017, slightly lower than previous expectations. The agency increased its demand estimates for 2018 to 470,000 bpd from 410,000 bpd. Demand is expected to climb an additional 340,000 bpd in 2019 to 20.65 million bpd, the agency said.\nReporting by Jessica Resnick-Ault; editing by Marguerita Choy\n "}

Soon afterwards, Anwar was jailed on charges of sodomy and graft, after being sacked as the deputy prime minister. He denied the charges, dismissing them as politically motivated. \nAnwar later led an opposition alliance to stunning electoral gains in 2013. Najib\u2019s Barisan Nasional coalition lost the popular vote in that election, but managed to stay in power after winning a majority of the seats in parliament. \nBut Anwar was convicted and jailed again in 2013 for sodomizing a former aide, a charge he and his supporters describe as an attempt to end his career. \nThe sodomy conviction disqualifies Anwar from political office and from contesting the next election. A royal pardon, however, would let him contest. \nOpposition to Prime Minister Najib has brought Anwar and Mahathir back together, with their parties now working in the opposition coalition. \nNajib has been embroiled in a corruption scandal involving state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). In civil lawsuits, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged that about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB. \nThe fund has denied any wrongdoing and Najib, who founded 1MDB, has denied all allegations of corruption against him and was cleared of wrongdoing by Malaysia\u2019s attorney-general.

There were also signs that the replicating virus had stimulated the immune system, with white blood cells or so-called \u201ckiller\u201d T-cells being drawn to the tumor to attack it. \nBecause the virus only infects cancer cells and leaves healthy cells alone, patients who received the experimental treatment reported only mild side-effects such as slight flu-like symptoms. \nUntil these positive results, scientists had been doubtful about whether the virus would be able to pass into the brain because of the protective blood-brain barrier membrane. \nHowever, injecting the virus directly into the brain would be difficult and potentially dangerous. \nAlan Melcher of Britain\u2019s Institute of Cancer Research, who also co-led the study, said the results pointed a way forward for more trials using this virus, including testing whether it can harness the immune system to super-charge the effect of existing chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments. \n\u201cNow we know we can get reovirus across the blood-brain barrier, we have begun clinical studies to see just how effective this viral immunotherapy can be,\u201d he said.

Google said its users of Android phones - more than 80 percent of the global market - were protected if they had the latest security updates. \nApple remained silent for more than a day about the fate of the hundreds of millions of users of its iPhones and iPads. Ben Johnson, co-founder and chief strategist for cyber security firm Carbon Black, said the delay in updating customers about whether Apple\u2019s devices are at risk could affect Apple\u2019s drive to get more business customers to adopt its hardware. \n\u201cSomething this severe gets the attention of all the employees and executives at a company, and when they go asking the IT and security people about it and security doesn\u2019t have an answer for iPhones and iPads, it just doesn\u2019t give a whole lot of confidence,\u201d Johnson said.

The rush comes during a period when the S&P 500 rose about 4 percent and was off to one of its fastest-ever starts for a calendar year. \nThe rush of cash is inspired by a \"fear of missing out,\" Michael Hartnett, BofAML's chief investment strategist, said in a report on weekly fund flows. He added that the \"frothy price action likely continues in the short term,\" though the firm's indicator of market sentiment is getting closer to a sell level. \nNew money didn't just go into exchange-traded funds that passively track market indexes like the S&P 500 and Dow industrials . Active funds, which have seen massive outflows in the past several years, also have reached a four-year peak inflows during the past four weeks. \nAll told, equity ETFs have pulled in $38.2 billion in 2018 while their mutual fund counterparts have gathered a net $5.6 billion, according to BofAML. Most mutual funds are run by managers who actively pick stocks and carry considerably higher fees than ETFs. \nThe one-week total inflow of $23.9 billion was the seventh-best on record. \nU.S. funds showed the strongest money gains with $6.4 billion for the week, while Japan attracted $3.6 billion, emerging markets saw $3.5 billion and Europe pulled in $2.2 billion in creations. U.S. large-cap funds were the biggest beneficiary by style, with $6.5 billion of inflows, BofAML reported. \nBy sector, financials took in $1.6 billion while technology and energy saw $700 million apiece. \nThe surge comes as sentiment surveys show both professional and mom-and-pop investors getting much more optimistic. \nThe latest Investors Intelligence poll of professional newsletter editors saw bulls outnumber bears by 66.7 percent to 12.7 percent, the biggest spread since April 1986. The American Association of Independent Investors retail survey reported the difference at 54.1 percent to 21.4 percent.

But it should be on the immigration policy\u2019s own terms ... not to get tax cuts,\u201d he said. \nRasmussen, who heads the Liberal Party, said he would therefore only continue tax negotiations in areas where DF and the government have already agreed to proceed. \nHe said he hoped to be able to \u201crather quickly\u201d reach a deal on the tax policy for the next four years but not for the years through to 2025 as he had first intended. \n\u201cI bet there will be other opportunities before we get there, so it\u2019s not that the government is giving up on its ambitions,\u201d Rasmussen said. \nHis junior coalition partner Liberal Alliance (LA) had said before Christmas that the coming tax cuts would be \u201chistorically big\u201d. \nThe anti-immigration DF is not part of the three-way coalition, but the government depends on it for a majority in parliament. \nDF leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl said Rasmussen\u2019s decision on Tuesday made it possible for the parties to move on despite the rather \u201clocked\u201d political situation in parliament. \nDahl said DF would continue to work for its tighter immigration proposals regarding war refugees. \nReporting by Teis Jensen and Erik Matzen; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n "}

Under a managed distribution plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the fund will distribute long-term capital gains and\/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution level. You should not draw any conclusions about the fund\u2019s investment performance from the amount of the fund\u2019s distributions or from the terms of the fund\u2019s managed distribution plan. The Board of the fund may amend the terms of the plan or terminate the plan at any time without prior notice to the fund's shareholders. The amendment or termination of a plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the fund\u2019s common shares. The plan will be subject to periodic review by the Board. With each distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income, the fund will issue a notice to shareholders and an accompanying press release which will provide detailed information regarding the amount and composition of the distribution and other related information. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in the notice to shareholders are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the fund\u2019s investment experience during its full fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell them how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. The fund may at times distribute more than its net investment income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the distribution may result in a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that shareholders invested in the fund is paid back to them. A return of capital does not necessarily reflect a fund\u2019s investment performance and should not be confused with \u2018yield\u2019 or \u2018income\u2019. Any such returns of capital will decrease the fund's total assets and, therefore, could have the effect of increasing the fund's expense ratio. In addition, in order to make the level of distributions called for under its plan, the fund may have to sell portfolio securities at a less than opportune time. For estimated source information for distributions paid in prior periods, please see MFS.com and click on the following links: Products, Closed-End Funds, Dividend Source Information.\n*Distribution from \"Other Sources\" may contain sources of income other than ordinary income, such as short term capital gains, long term capital gains, or return of capital, which can not be determined until the close of the fund's fiscal year end. Distributions that are treated for federal income tax purposes as a return of capital will reduce a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares and, to the extent the distribution exceeds a shareholder's adjusted tax basis, will be treated as a gain to the shareholder from a sale of shares. Please see the fund's most recent dividend source information available from payable date at MFS.com for the breakdown of the distribution.\nInvestors who want to make changes to their accounts should contact their financial advisor, brokerage firm, or other nominee with whom the shares are registered.

Best is revising its outlook on the U.S. health insurance industry to stable from negative for 2018, citing that insurers overall have been able to adapt to the pressures from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and improve earnings and risk-adjusted capitalization levels.\nA new Best\u2019s Briefing, titled, \u201cMarket Segment Outlook: U.S. Health,\u201d states that the lower level of profitability in 2014 and 2015 was driven by the commercial individual segment, and although the individual exchange business has reported losses, this segment still constitutes a small portion of health insurers\u2019 operations. Other product lines, particularly the employer group segment, as well as the Medicaid and Medicare Advantage lines of business, remain profitable.\nThe briefing notes that the ACA exchange business improved in 2016 and 2017, driven partially by consecutive years of high rate increases and a narrowing of provider networks. The exchange membership still has a concentration of individuals who are higher risk and greater utilizers of services, but the exchange population has stabilized. A.M. Best had been concerned that with the potential for a repeal or replacement of the ACA, an increase in utilization would occur in 2017 as individuals might rush to seek medical treatments and services before losing coverage. However, this spike did not occur, and medical cost trends were relatively flat in 2016 and 2017. A repeal and replacement of the ACA is still a possibility; however, A.M. Best believes that after several failed attempts to pass a bill in 2017, the U.S. Congress may choose to focus on other issues over the next fiscal year. Other factors creating a more stable marketplace include the decrease in the number of carriers participating in the ACA exchanges and more membership continuity and consistency.\nAccording to the briefing, the elimination of the cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidy payment in fourth-quarter 2017 will have a slightly negative impact on earnings. However, most carriers had already received a sizeable portion of the payment for the year. Additionally, the elimination of the CSR subsidy will not have an impact in 2018 for most carriers, as many state regulators allowed plans to adjust premium rates prior to the open enrollment to avoid a potential negative financial impact. In addition, the tax-bill\u2019s repeal of the individual mandate, which removes the penalty for not having insurance, does not take effect until 2019.\nNegative factors continue to impact the industry, but A.M. Best believes that insurers overall have been able to adapt and as a result, does not expect any significant deterioration in market conditions over the next year.\nFor the full copy of this briefing, please visit http:\/\/www3.ambest.com\/bestweek\/purchase.asp?record_code=269332 .\nA video interview with Joseph Zazzera, director, about the U.S. health insurance industry also is available.\nA.M.

I\u2018m maybe better when we\u2019re closer together,\u201d said Federer. \n\u201cThe court plays fast, so it helps if you approach (the net) and do it the right way. It was working out well, so I thought I\u2019d keep going until I had to fix it. That never happened, so I was able to cruise all the way through.\u201d \nThe tie went to a mixed doubles decider after Kerber continued her strong start to the campaign under new coach Wim Fissette by beating Bencic 6-4 6-1 to level the score at 1-1. \nWorld number four Zverev finished with one singles win from four matches in a patchy preparation ahead of the year\u2019s first grand slam at Melbourne Park starting on Jan. 15.

(Nuvo or the Company) (TSX: NRI; OTCQX: NRIFF), a commercial healthcare company with a portfolio of commercial products and pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities, today announced it has acquired the global, ex-U.S. (the Territory) rights to Resultz \u00ae (50% isopropyl myristate, 50% cyclomethicone D5 topical solution lice and egg removal kit) from Piedmont Pharmaceuticals LLC (Piedmont). The transaction includes existing royalty streams in the Royalty Markets (as defined below) and all product and intellectual property (IP) rights in the Territory.\nResultz is a commercial-stage, best-in-class, clinically proven, safe, non-pesticide, over-the-counter (OTC) treatment for head lice. This market-leading product is currently sold in several European markets, including France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as Canada, Russia, Australia and Israel (collectively the Royalty Markets), through a network of existing license agreements and partners that will be assumed by Nuvo. Aggregate net sales of Resultz in the Royalty Markets, for the twelve months ending September 2017, were approximately US$16.0 million generating royalty payments of approximately US$1.5 million. Resultz is currently approved for sale under its European Conformity (CE) mark as a class 1 medical device, but not yet partnered or launched in all remaining E.U. territories, including the key markets of Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Scandinavia and Greece. The current head lice market in the remaining E.U. territories was valued at approximately US$150 million in 2016. Resultz has not been partnered or approved in most rest of world markets, including the Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific (outside of Japan and Australia). However, the European CE mark is recognized in many of these markets and may facilitate class 1 medical device registration procedures via local partners. With a global head lice prevalence of approximately 6%, the market opportunity for Resultz in all non-Royalty Markets is attractive and growing. This transaction is immediately accretive and provides Nuvo with an additional global product that, alongside existing manufacturing partners, can be produced at Nuvo's Varennes, Qu\u00e9bec manufacturing site.\n\"This is an exciting day for Nuvo,\" said Jesse Ledger, Nuvo's President & CEO. \"The addition of the Resultz brand to our global product portfolio is an example of the disciplined transactions we are pursuing to make Nuvo a more diversified and profitable company. Resultz checks all of the boxes for an ideal new Nuvo product: it is approved, has commercialized-generating royalty revenue, broad global IP protection, provides significant opportunity for global geographic expansion and revenue growth and can be manufactured in our Varennes, Qu\u00e9bec facility.\"\nPurchase Agreement Details\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Nuvo has paid US$7.0 million on close to Piedmont. The transaction also includes a single-digit royalty payable by Nuvo on net sales generated from non-Royalty Markets through 2023 and potential added future consideration in the form of payments for achieving certain aggregate annual net sales-based milestones.\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated acted as exclusive financial advisor to Piedmont Pharmaceuticals LLC in this transaction.\nAbout Resultz\nResultz is a pesticide-free pediculicide rinse which was originally developed by Piedmont that addresses the challenge of increasing pesticide resistance in lice and concerns about patient safety through exposure to pesticides. In as little as a 5-minute application (the shortest treatment time for head lice products), Resultz acts to disrupt the wax covering of the head louse resulting in their dehydration and death. Resultz lice and egg removal kit facilitates removal of lice, nymphs and nits with efficacy of up to 100%. If necessary, a second application approximately 7-10 days later will eliminate any remaining lice. The Resultz lice and egg removal kit and its unique physical mechanism of action allows Resultz to work even with pesticide resistant super lice. Resultz is indicated for treating both children and adults. It has an excellent safety profile and contains active ingredients commonly found in many cosmetic products. Resultz was first launched as a medical device in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2005 and more than ten million patients have been treated globally to-date. Current global licensees include Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC, Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Lapidot Medical. Resultz is also pending registration in Japan, where the local license is held by Sato Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Resultz is protected by a robust portfolio of 40 issued patents globally.\nAbout Piedmont Pharmaceuticals LLC\nPiedmont Pharmaceuticals is committed to continuing to grow the Resultz Brand globally. It is closely affiliated with Piedmont Animal Health LLC which at one time was a wholly owned subsidiary. Piedmont Animal Health is a Greensboro, N.C.-based companion animal pharmaceutical development and marketing company focused on inventing and developing innovative technologies to address veterinary healthcare needs. Piedmont's founders have developed, launched, and\/or marketed over 20 FDA Rx companion animal products for dogs, cats, and horses, including four innovative products developed and launched in the U.S. by Piedmont Animal Health in the last four years. The company is currently developing a broad range of convenient and long-acting medications, including ones focusing on the therapeutic areas of pain management and anti-infectives.\nAbout Nuvo Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nNuvo (TSX: NRI; OTCQX: NRIFF) is a commercial healthcare company with a portfolio of commercial products and pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities.

That implies the total cryptocurrency issued would be worth just over $5.9 billion. \nThere is much confusion, however, over how the mechanism will work. Opposition politicians have already panned the project as a fanciful idea doomed to fail and useless at getting food to the millions who are suffering from product shortages and the world\u2019s highest inflation. \nMaduro says the cryptocurrency will usher in the \u201c21st century\u201d and boost Venezuela\u2019s access to hard currency. \n\u201cI have ordered the emission of 100 million petros with the legal sustenance of Venezuela\u2019s certified and legalized oil wealth,\u201d said Maduro in a state television address. \n\u201cEvery petro will be equal in value to Venezuela\u2019s oil barrel.\u201d \nVenezuela has the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, according to OPEC, and makes some 95 percent of its export revenue from oil. Critics say the government has squandered wealth from a decade-long oil boom and that without reforms any influx of resources will also be burned through. \nStrict currency controls have forced people onto the black market, on which a dollar can buy 137,000 bolivars. The country\u2019s strongest official rate, meanwhile, is 10 bolivars per dollar. \nThat fall in value combined with money printing by the central bank is behind what many analysts are measuring as hyperinflation. \nLocal economic consultancy Ecoanalitica said prices rose more than 80 percent in December alone. Money supply, according to the central bank, was up more than 1,000 percent last year. \nMaduro said the cryptocurrency issuance would take place through virtual exchanges in the coming day, but did not give further details. \nCryptocurrencies are decentralized and their success relies on transparency, clear rules and equal treatment of all involved.

AT&T declined to comment.\nThe flagship Mate 10 Pro that was to be introduced is Huawei's most high end product to date, equipped with its own AI-powered chips that Huawei says process data much faster than those used by Apple and Samsung. It was launched in Europe in October with a price tag of 799 euros ($955).\nHuawei's smartphone chief Richard Yu flagged Huawei's ambition to become a truly global smartphone brand in 2018 in his New Year address to staff, and also told The Information in an interview in late December that it planned to spend $100 million on marketing to raise brand awareness in the United States.\nBut the collapse of the deal with AT&T, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, will mean that Huawei will likely struggle to make a hit of its smartphones there.\n\"This makes it very difficult for Huawei to get significant in the US as the open channels account for only about 10-11 percent of the market,\" said Canalys analyst Mo Jia, referring to sales channels outside telecom carriers and vendors' own stores.\nHe said Huawei's proprietary mobile chips may have presented a bigger regulatory hurdle for its U.S. market entry in the current political climate, compared with other Chinese vendors's entry strategy that relies on U.S. chip suppliers.\n\"Whatever they have spent on US marketing is a waste now, and the letdown this time may also deter other potential carrier-partners in the future,\" Jia said.\nIn 2012, Huawei and ZTE Corp were the subject of a U.S. investigation that looked into whether the companies' equipment provided an opportunity for foreign espionage and threatened critical U.S. infrastructure - a link that Huawei has consistently denied.

Morgan to help it with a sale process, as the one-time Wall Street favorite battles falling demand for its sports cameras and drones. \nThe company\u2019s shares, which fell as much as 33 percent to a record low of $5.04 on Monday, recouped some of their losses after the sale talks were first reported by CNBC. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been clear that we are open to any opportunity that will help us scale our mission. JP Morgan is our banker, but there is no active engagement to sell,\u201d GoPro said in emailed comments to Reuters. \n\u201cIt is our responsibility to scale the business, so if the right opportunity presented itself, it\u2019s something we would consider,\u201d it added. \nJ.P. Morgan declined to comment. \nEarlier in the day, the company lowered its fourth-quarter revenue forecast, following weak demand for its cameras in the holiday season, and announced a plan to exit the drone business. \nThe company has suffered a decline in demand for its eponymous cameras and Karma drones - mostly used by sports junkies and travel enthusiasts - for several quarters. \nFurthermore, it forecasts that tough regulatory hurdles in Europe and the United States will likely reduce the market for drones in the years ahead. Its exit from the drone business will take place after selling the existing Karma inventory, it added. \nThe company cut the price of its latest HERO6 cameras to $399 from $499 this week, a decision that it said would hurt revenue by around $80 million in the fourth quarter. \nMorgan Stanley said in a research note on Monday that the price cut would make earnings growth difficult in fiscal 2018. \nThe move followed weak demand for existing camera models. \n\u201cDespite significant marketing support, we found consumers were reluctant to purchase HERO5 Black at the same price it launched at one year earlier,\u201d Chief Executive Nick Woodman said in a statement alongside results. \nThe company now expects fourth-quarter revenue of $340 million, compared with its November projection of $470 million, plus or minus $10 million. It also said it plans to cut more than 250 jobs as it restructures. GoPro had 1,254 employees as of Sept. 30. \n\u201cCutting costs is a good move, although now it\u2019s about if the company can turn this ship around themselves,\u201d Daniel Ives, analyst at GBH Insights, said. \nWoodman will reduce his 2018 cash compensation to $1, the company said.

The tech company has been working with Fiat Chrysler since 2016 to outfit its Chrysler Pacifica minivans with autonomous technology. Waymo plans to launch a fully autonomous ride-hailing service early next year in Phoenix, Arizona. \nIn a statement, Volkswagen said the self-driving technology can be integrated over time across the automaker\u2019s brands and in different product categories, whether self-driving pods, shuttles, delivery vans or self-driving trucks. \nFor Hyundai, Aurora\u2019s technology will be incorporated into custom-developed models and tested in markets including China. Hyundai said the first model to be used in testing will be its latest generation fuel-cell vehicle, debuting at the CES technology conference in Las Vegas next week. \nUnder the alliance, Hyundai plans to commercialise level 4 autonomous vehicles - which can operate without human input or oversight under select conditions - in unidentified \u201cpilot smart cities\u201d by 2021. \nThis is the first announcement on a self-driving technology partnership by the South Korean carmaker, which has traditionally shunned tie-ups in favour of developing technology in-house. The strategy has raised investor concerns that it may be left behind in the race for self-driving and electric cars. \nA company spokeswoman said Hyundai has \u201cvarious collaborations\u201d under way in self-driving technology and would continue to pursue cooperation. \nUrmson said that while each carmaker partnership requires close collaboration to integrate the self-driving system, the technology is \u201cquite transferrable\u201d between vehicle models and manufacturers.

Given the bullish growth outlook, economists expect the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in March after increasing borrowing costs three times last year. \n\u201cStrong manufacturing and construction data confirm the U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders at the turn of the year,\u201d said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. \u201cThe Fed remains solidly on track to lift rates again in March and two more times this year, with possible upside risk if growth doesn\u2019t simmer down.\u201d \nThe Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 59.7 last month, the second-highest reading in six years, from 58.2 in November. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. \nThe survey\u2019s new orders sub-index shot up 5.4 points to 69.4, the highest reading since January 2004. Manufacturers also reported an increase in export orders. While a measure of factory employment fell 2.7 points last months it remained at lofty levels consistent with an expansion in manufacturing payrolls. \nFactories also reported paying more for raw materials, with the survey\u2019s prices index jumping by 3.5 points. Rising raw material prices bolster the view that inflation will pick up in 2018. \nManufacturing is likely to get a boost this year from a $1.5 trillion tax cut approved by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress last month. The overhaul of the tax code, the most sweeping in 30 years, slashed the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. \nBusiness spending surged in anticipation of the corporate tax cuts. Recent weakness in the dollar and a strengthening global economy are expected to buoy exports of U.S.-made goods, which would underpin manufacturing. \n\u201cIt is more than just domestic developments that are lifting animal spirits,\u201d said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. \u201cA number of the published industry comments focused on a pick-up in demand from overseas.\u201d \nThe dollar .DXY was trading higher against a basket of currencies. U.S. stock indexes hit record highs and prices of U.S. Treasuries rose. BULLISH OUTLOOK \nThe ISM survey showed manufacturers upbeat about the economic outlook. Machinery producers reported strong international sales and computer and electronic products manufacturers said they were \u201cseeing a ramp-up with companies releasing early 2018 spend now.\u201d \nFood, beverage and tobacco products manufacturers, however, struck a more cautious note saying that while the economy and business were strong, signals of \u201cheadwinds in 2018 are persistent.\u201d \nIn a separate report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.8 percent to an all-time high of $1.257 trillion in November. It advanced 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis. \nThe manufacturing and construction reports added to data ranging from the labor market to housing and consumer spending in sketching a robust picture of the U.S. economy. \nFollowing Wednesday\u2019s data, the Atlanta Fed raised its fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to an annualized rate of 3.2 percent. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent pace in the third quarter. \nIn November, spending on private residential projects soared 1.0 percent to the highest level since February 2007 after rising 0.3 percent in October. The increase was in line with a recent jump in homebuilding and supported expectations that housing would boost economic growth in the fourth quarter after being a drag on GDP since the April-June period. \nSpending on nonresidential structures rebounded 0.9 percent in November after falling 0.2 percent in the prior month. Overall, spending on private construction projects climbed 1.0 percent in November to a record high. That followed a 0.3 percent increase in October. \nOutlays on public construction projects rose 0.2 percent in November after jumping 3.5 percent in October. Economists, however, expect modest gains in public spending in the months ahead. \n\u201cMany state budgets are being squeezed by weaker-than-expected revenues, and face other budgetary pressures related to things like health care,\u201d said Nancy Vanden Houten, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in New York. \u201cAlso, the impact of the new tax law on state and local budgets is not yet clear.\u201d Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao"}

{"published":"2018-01-24T17:34:00.000+02:00","title":"Mnuchin comment surprises financial markets, turns dollar decline into 'one-way bet'","text":"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's comment that a weak dollar is good for the country accelerated a decline in the currency and fed fears in a market already speculating that White House may make the dollar less attractive for the longer term.\nMnuchin's comments echo statements by President Donald Trump, who famously helped turn a market trend of a stronger dollar last January when he said, prior to his inauguration, that the dollar was \"too strong\" and that U.S. companies can't compete because of it, particularly against the Chinese. The dollar index has lost more than 10 percent since then, and after Mnuchin's comment Wednesday morning, it sank to a new three-year low.\nThe comments also depart from the policy of the past three presidential administrations and Treasury secretaries, going back to Robert Rubin, to support a strong dollar policy, at least publicly. Prior to Trump, presidents in recent history have refrained from talking the currency up or down.\n\"Obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities,\" Mnuchin told reporters in Davos, according to Bloomberg, adding that the currency's short-term value is \"not a concern of ours at all.\"\nWhile the weak dollar could help U.S. exports, strategists point out it devalues all types of U.S. assets, including Treasurys, and makes the cost of goods from overseas more expensive for everyone from manufacturers to everyday Americans.\nWhether a weak dollar policy was the intended message or not, the fact that Mnuchin made the comments at a briefing at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, was not lost on the market. The forum is viewed as the bastion of globalization and free trade, while Trump officials have been or are expected to reaffirm the administration's America first policies, seen as protectionist by some.\nIn an interview on CNBC after Mnuchin's comments, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross took issue with characterizations that the U.S. is departing from its historically strong dollar policy.\nTrump is expected to speak there later this week.\nThe dollar was already set on a downward course this year, and Mnuchin's comments help cement that path. The euro rose to 1.239 per dollar, and yen gained about 1 percent Wednesday against the greenback.\n\"I think you could have a situation where cyclical forces come into play, and it snaps back, but for now, they've put a wild card on the dollar which could tell you that normal cyclical forces won't operate,\" said Robert Sinche, chief global strategist at Amherst Pierpont. \"They basically open this up as a one-way bet for traders, and traders will keep pushing it and keep pushing it. ... Who's going to stand in front of it? It's not a healthy global environment.\"\nThe Trump administration, which this week slapped new tariffs on Asian washing machines and solar panels , sees a weaker dollar as a positive for American exporters. But on the other hand, the market has been worrying about the fact that central banks are clearly diversifying reserve holdings away from the dollar, and U.S. assets, like Treasurys could become less appealing.\n\"I think the dollar will stay the reserve currency. We're too big and too influential, but does it mean people have to hold so many dollar assets if the administration says this is not a good place to hold your money, particularly with a trillion dollar deficit? There's a long way down,\" Sinche said.\nTreasury Department data show that China and Japan, the two largest holders of U.S. Treasurys, reduced their holdings in November as the dollar weakened. Last month, the International Monetary Fund reported the dollar's share of global currency reserves fell in the third quarter to 63.5 percent, its smallest since mid-2014.\nConcerns about the U.S. debt was also stirred up by a report, quoting unnamed officials, that China was not as interested in buying Treasurys, but market pros say China has little alternative and relies on the U.S. Treasury market.\nMnuchin also spoke in favor of a strong dollar. \"Longer term, the strength of the dollar is a reflection of the strength of the U.S. economy and the fact that it is and will continue to be the primary currency in terms of the reserve currency,\" he said.\nBut the fact he was so vehement on a weak dollar came as a surprise to some in the markets.\n\"It's not good or bad. It's a surprise and markets aren't priced for it. There's this pivot away from the U.S. dollar bull market. Part of it is driven by global reflation and part of it is driven by Trump, \" said Mark McCormick, North American head of foreign exchange strategy at TD Securities. McCormick said he did expect that type of rhetoric from the administration, and he also expects protectionist trade practices to be a negative for the dollar.\n\"It's kind of scary stuff,\" said Sinche. \"Trade, trade, trade. They view everything through one lens.\"\nStocks were lower in afternoon trading, giving up morning gains, and analysts said one factor was some concern about the dollar remark and the potential for protectionist U.S. actions. Treasury yields were higher but moved off highs of the day.\n\"Equities and risk assets continue to move along here,\" said Sinche, before the afternoon stock sell off. \"I would remind people the '87 crash, the precipitating factor was an argument about supporting the dollar between Germany and the U.S.\""}

Bozorgmehr Sharafedin 6 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Iran is stepping up a crackdown against anti-government protests that pose the most audacious challenge to its clerical leadership since 2009. Following are factors that have brought Iranians to the streets and the challenges the authorities face. People protest in Tehran, Iran December 30, 2017 in this still image from a video obtained by REUTERS. HOW SERIOUS ARE THE PROTESTS? \nThe demonstrations, which began last week, are the most serious since unrest in 2009 that followed the disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. \nPolitical protests are rare in Iran, where security services are pervasive. And yet tens of thousands of people have protested across the country since Thursday. \nIn a sign that Iran is taking the protests more seriously, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused what he called enemies of the Islamic Republic on Tuesday of stirring unrest. \nKhamenei, the ultimate authority in a cumbersome system of dual clerical and republican rule, said he would address the nation about the recent events \u201cwhen the time is right\u201d. \nUnlike the pro-reform demonstrations of 2009, the latest protests appear more spontaneous and don\u2019t seem to be orchestrated by leaders who can be identified and rounded up by the authorities. \nCalls made across the country for an end to economic hardship and alleged corruption are especially sensitive because Iranian leaders often portray the 1979 Islamic revolution which overthrew the U.S.-backed Shah as a revolt by the poor against exploitation and oppression. \nAlthough there are a variety of demands from different classes of society, videos posted on social media suggest young, working class people make up the biggest numbers. \nThat could be more dangerous for the authorities because they have regarded the less well-off as loyal to the Islamic republic, as opposed to the more middle class protesters who took to the streets nine years ago. \nAccording to official figures, 90 percent of those arrested were under 25 years old. Many young people are much more interested in jobs and change than in the Islamist idealism and anti-west sentiment that the old guard clings to. \nSecurity forces may be calculating that they can still contain the unrest as no political group inside the country has put its weight behind the movement, and the workers lack strong unions to support them. \nWHY CAN\u2018T THE GOVERNMENT FIND A QUICK SOLUTION? \nThe government\u2019s main challenge is to find a way to suppress the protests without provoking more anger as demonstrators attack police stations, banks and mosques. \nSo far, while the authorities have threatened strong measures, in practice they have largely been restrained, arresting hundreds of people but holding back elite forces that have crushed past unrest. \nHardline measures could agitate those Iranians who have been calling for the downfall of the clerical leadership, including Khamenei. \nAuthorities want to take control while avoiding a repeat of 2009. In June that year, a video showing protester Neda Agha-Soltan\u2019s last moments after being shot in the chest made her an icon of the opposition movement. \nThe state has a powerful security apparatus but so far it has refrained from sending in the elite Revolutionary Guards, the Basij militia and plain-clothed security forces which crushed the 2009 uprising and killed dozens of protesters. \nStill, prolonged demonstrations could force the government to act. Iran\u2019s leaders believe they can count on support from many of the generation that took part as youths in the 1979 revolution because of their ideological commitment and the economic gains they have made under the Islamic government, analysts say. WHAT ARE THE MAIN DEMANDS OF THE PROTESTERS? \nIranians across the country want higher wages and an end to alleged graft. But as the unrest has spread, protestors have directed their anger at the religious establishment. \nMany also question the wisdom of Iran\u2019s foreign policy in the Middle East, where it has intervened in Syria and Iraq in a battle for influence with rival Saudi Arabia. \nThe country\u2019s financial support for Palestinians and the Lebanese Shi\u2018ite group Hezbollah also angered Iranians, who want their government to focus on domestic economic problems instead. \nSome demonstrators even shouted \u201cReza Shah, bless your soul\u201d - a reference to Iran\u2019s ruler from 1925 to 1941, and his Pahlavi dynasty which was overthrown by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic\u2019s first leader. \nWHAT ARE IRAN\u2018S ECONOMIC PROSPECTS? \nPresident Hassan Rouhani championed a deal struck with world powers in 2015 to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear programme in return for the lifting of most international sanctions. However, he has failed to deliver on promises of prosperity in the OPEC oil producer where youth unemployment reached 28.8 percent this year. \nStill, the economy has improved under Rouhani\u2019s government and it is no longer in dire straits. \nInflation dropped into single digits for the first time in about a quarter century in June, 2016. Gross domestic product growth soared to 12.5 percent in the year to March 20, 2017, although this was almost entirely due to a leap in oil exports. \nHowever, growth has been too slow for the overwhelmingly youthful population. \nIran\u2019s recovery has been curbed by tensions with the United States. President Donald Trump has raised the possibility that sanctions could be reimposed or new ones introduced. Reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Editing by Michael Georgy and David Stamp"}

Alongside its allied producers, the 14-member cartel is keeping supply limits in place for a second consecutive year in order to try to clear a price-denting glut of oil inventories. \n\"We're not bullish on prices but we are bullish on returns,\" Jeff Currie, head of commodities at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC on Tuesday. Energy market environment 'very strong' \nCurrie said the underlying environment in the energy market was \"very strong.\" And despite a relatively flat oil price forecast, traders investing in oil futures should still be able to benefit from \" backwardation \" throughout the year. \nBackwardation is when the current price of oil is higher than a future cost of oil \u2014 a sign of higher immediate demand. Currie said this had created a \"positive carry\" for investors. \n\"When we talk about positive carry in oil, the investor can go out and buy the back end of the (price) curve, hold onto the position, roll it up higher, sell it at a premium and buy again. That's where we expect the returns from oil to come from,\" he said.

The revisions were up from $58 a barrel and $55 a barrel, respectively. The firm said a stronger-than-anticipated OPEC-led commitment to extend production cuts was likely to support prices through 2018. \nBrent crude traded at $67.85 a barrel at around 11:45 a.m. London time (6:45 a.m. ET), up 0.1 percent, while U.S. crude was seen at $61.94, up 0.3 percent. 'Massive overheating' \nLast week, a senior analyst at Commerzbank said oil prices would likely pullback by at least 15 percent over the coming weeks. Eugen Weinberg told CNBC on Friday that the current rally was \"definitely due to massive overheating of the speculators and is likely to correct over the next month.\" \nThe price of oil collapsed from near $120 a barrel in June 2014 due to weak demand, a strong dollar and booming U.S. shale production.

It looks like it\u2019s going to give a bit of turn throughout.\u201d (Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)"}

Sale are set to begin in February, the company said. \nThe launch of the discount brand follows the lifting of antitrust restrictions last July, allowing BRF to target a segment that grew during the country\u2019s recession. \nAntitrust agency Cade lifted brand limits established in 2011 at the time it approved the merger of Sadia and Perdig\u00e3o, which created BRF SA. \n\u201cKidelli will compete in a market which registered robust growth in the last few years,\u201d Almeida said referring to the new brand name. He declined to offer sales or margin forecasts related to the launch. \nThe new processed products will cost 15 percent less than the average of more traditional brands in the market, Almeida said, and be produced at five of the company\u2019s 29 plants in Brazil. \nThe new brand will have a sales force independent from BRF\u2019s leading Sadia and Perdig\u00e3o brands, the company said. In the last three years, BRF has invested 560 million reais ($172 million) in \u201cinnovation\u201d projects, part of which went to develop the new brand, Almeida said. \nShares rose 0.55 percent to 39.91 reais in early-afternoon trading, after the announcement. The stock has risen about 9 percent this year, reflecting expectations of an improved outlook for the company as Brazil\u2019s economy recovers from a deep recession. \nBRF sees \u201chealthy growth\u201d in the food market this year, an improvement from the prior three years, Almeida said. \nThe launch will help BRF, Brazil\u2019s largest chicken exporter, reduce idle capacity at its Brazilian plants and allow it to compete again with regional brands on a national scale after the end of the antitrust restrictions.

The New York Democrat, who represents a large constituency of staunch opponents of President Donald Trump and the Republican Party, may be empowered to undermine Republican bills at every turn. Republicans may be forced to abandon the sweeping legislative packages they introduced in 2017 in lieu of a more piecemeal approach.\nAnd this dynamic will play out as both parties look ahead to the midterm elections of 2018, which many analysts and statisticians claim will favor the Democrats.\n\"The bottom line is that Chuck Schumer basically controls the state of play in the Senate and therefore legislatively,\" Gregg said.\n\"Everything now is in the context of the next election.\""}

LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- As progress continues for the merger with Bayer, Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) announced strong results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2018, growing as-reported earnings per share (EPS) to $0.38. Early indicators from the first three months, such as volume and pricing growth for INTACTA RR2 PRO TM soybeans in South America, improved pricing in glyphosate and more than $85 million in gains from asset sales, signal that the company is well positioned to deliver on its business goals.\nLikewise, in its annual Research & Development (R&D) pipeline showcase today, Monsanto highlighted how new technologies will help growers combat threats in the field and optimize opportunities with less land, energy and water. This marks the fifth consecutive year of more than 20 research projects advancing. The company released information on the R&D showcase in a separate announcement this morning.\nFirst Quarter ($ in millions, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Net Sales by Segment Corn seed and traits $ 787 $ 949 Soybean seed and traits 728 600 Cotton seed and traits 120 116 Vegetable seeds 114 131 All other crops seeds and traits 21 52 TOTAL Seeds and Genomics $ 1,770 $ 1,848 Agricultural productivity $ 888 $ 802 TOTAL Agricultural Productivity $ 888 $ 802 TOTAL Net Sales $ 2,658 $ 2,650 Gross Profit $ 1,312 $ 1,259 Operating Expenses $ 1,070 $ 1,012 Interest Expense \u2013 Net $ 109 $ 118 Other (Income) Expense\u2013 Net $ (97 ) $ 43 Net Income Attributable to Monsanto Company $ 169 $ 29 Diluted Earnings per Share $ 0.38 $ 0.07 Items Affecting Comparability \u2013 EPS Impact (For definitions of adjustments to EPS, see note 1.)

We\u2019re excited and energized about the new areas of scientific advancement we expect to unlock by combining with Bayer, to allow us to bring more products to farmers faster.\"\nResults of Operations\nFor the fiscal year 2018 first quarter, net sales were nearly flat compared to the prior year\u2019s first quarter at $2.7 billion. Gross profit for the quarter grew slightly, to $1.3 billion. More than $85 million in gains from asset sales were recorded in the first quarter, the most significant being the sale of Precision Planting to AGCO.\nSelling, general and administrative costs were $664 million, and research and development expenses were $382 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Total selling, general and administrative costs and research and development expenses increased, mostly due to higher commissions, point-of-delivery costs and bad debt expense associated with the growth in South America, as well as from inflationary increases and increased spend on R&D.\nThe company\u2019s fiscal year 2018 first quarter EPS on an as-reported basis was $0.38, as compared to $0.07 in the prior year. EPS on an ongoing basis was $0.41, well above the prior year\u2019s $0.21, driven by the strong start to the business in South America. (For a reconciliation of as-reported EPS to ongoing EPS, see note 1).\nCash Flow\nFor the first three months of fiscal year 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion, compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $1.5 billion in the first three months of last year. Net cash required by investing activities for the first three months of fiscal year 2018 was $210 million, compared to $327 million for the same period of fiscal year 2017. Net cash provided by financing activities for the first three months of fiscal year 2018 was $178 million, compared to net cash required of $655 million for the same period of fiscal year 2017. Free cash flow was down for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, at $874 million compared to $1.1 billion in the first three months of the prior year. (NOTE: free cash flow metric reflects the company\u2019s definition of free cash flow, which is operating cash flows less capital expenditures. For a reconciliation of free cash flow, see note 1.)\nFiscal Year 2018 Outlook\nThe company expects growth in its pretax income for fiscal year 2018, but did not provide specific financial guidance in light of the pending combination with Bayer. The expected growth drivers for Monsanto\u2019s business are continued improvements in pricing for glyphosate, plus the adoption of new technologies in Seeds and Genomics such as INTACTA RR2 PRO TM soybeans, Roundup Ready 2 Xtend \u00ae soybeans, Bollgard \u00ae II XtendFlex \u00ae cotton, and new corn hybrids around the world. Gains from recent asset sales are also contributing to growth. The company will remain disciplined as it monitors the evolution of U.S. corn and soybean plantings through the spring.\nFor Agricultural Productivity, volumes of XtendiMax \u00ae Herbicide with VaporGrip \u00ae Technology are expected to expand as acreage grows. The company continues to invest in the construction of its dicamba manufacturing plant in Luling, La., slated for completion in 2020.\nAs communicated previously, the company expects to complete its restructuring and cost savings initiative that began in fiscal year 2015, with the expectation that selling, general and administrative costs and research and development expenses in fiscal year 2018 will be down slightly year over year.

You\u2019re saying I caved and handed President Donald Trump a victory without fighting for DACA, or any principle at all. Well let me tell you, that is wrong. I mean, have you ever tried negotiating with Donald Trump? He\u2019s the greatest dealmaker of all time. \nRight off the bat the cards were stacked against me. He\u2019s a master negotiator (just look at all his successful casinos, which I know are successful because he mentioned this often in our negotiations). And little old me? I\u2019m just a guy from New York trying to make it in the big city, Washington DC. What do I know about dealmaking? Allow me to offer some insight into my dealings with the president so you might understand just how hard it was. \nFirst of all, I couldn\u2019t even get a meeting with him at first. That\u2019s a brilliant tactic on his part\u2014make himself unavailable, so he seems disinterested in a deal. I didn\u2019t see that coming. I tried to meet with him in the morning, but his staff said he was sleeping. Even in the early afternoon, still sleeping. Then around lunchtime, I thought it would be OK, but he was taking his twice-daily cheeseburger bath. By this point the shutdown had been in effect for more than 12 hours and I could tell he was trying to wear me down, and it was working. \nOnce I finally got him on the phone by telling the White House switchboard operator I was a Fox News morning show host, the president played another genius card from his Svengali deck of negotiating: pretending not to know what I was talking about. \u201cDACA,\u201d I said. He replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I could tell he was playing hardball, make me existentially define the very issue I had chosen to make the fulcrum of this high-stakes showdown. He caught me flat-footed and there was nothing I could do. I even tried bringing up other issues to chip away at, hoping to reach common ground\u2014a short-term CR, border security\u2014you know, things that all presidents know about. But he continued to play dumb. The art of the deal at work in front of my very eyes. \nFinally I decided my only remaining chance was to make inroads with his staff in the hopes that they could negotiate on my behalf. So I made a call to Stephen Miller on Sunday night. Unfortunately the president had anticipated my move, and he must have told his adviser exactly how to handle my overture, because Mr. Miller refused to even start negotiations with me. Instead, he picked up the phone, called me a wonderfully dealmakey epithet, and hung up. A tip of the hat to you, sir. \nOut of options and cleanly defeated by the greatest negotiator to ever walk this earth, I resigned myself to the reality that I would have to give in to the president\u2019s brilliantly ambiguous demands. I would like to thank the president for this Master Class in negotiating, even if I came out on the losing side. And if there\u2019s any consolation for me it\u2019s that I now have unbridled confidence in our president to negotiate with our nation\u2019s foremost adversaries like Russia and North Korea. \nAlways eager to learn, "}

The laggard among the major carriers was Air China, which managed to arrive or depart within 15 minutes of scheduled time on just 60.14 percent of its flights.\nJapan's strong showing across its airlines was, unsurprisingly, reflected in the efficient performance of its airports.\nIn the mega-size category, those airports that served more than 30 million departing passengers in 2017, Tokyo Haneda came top with 86.75 percent of flights arriving and departing with 16 minutes of the advertised schedule.\nAnd in the category of global airports that serve between 10 and 20 million departing passengers each year, Osaka International came top and Sapporo Okadama third for hitting on-time performance. Salt Lake City International in Utah managed to achieve second place with an 86.01 percent OTP.\nIn the middle category, described as major airports that serve between 20 and 30 million departing passengers, Minneapolis-St Paul International came top with 85.73 of flights operating on time."}

{"published":"2018-01-10T05:24:00.000+02:00","title":"Breakingviews - Chancellor: Bitcoin will never be real money","text":"LONDON It\u2019s easy enough to identify bitcoin and its ilk as being caught up in a speculative mania. A more difficult and important question is whether crypto-currencies have any future as money. In a world where the stability of conventional currencies is threatened globally by the vast expansion of central-bank balance sheets, high government indebtedness and the myriad ill consequences of ultra-low interest rates, it would be nice to believe this was the case. Yet bitcoin and its peers are not money and, unless they change fundamentally, never will be.\nBitcoin possesses many of the characteristics of a proper currency: it can be divided, stored (provided it\u2019s not with a dodgy broker where it\u2019s liable to disappear into the ether) and transferred. And its supply is limited. Money is just a social technology which has been through many previous incarnations \u2013 among the exotic varieties of cash listed by Paul Einzig in his book \u201cPrimitive Money\u201d 70 years ago are gin, jam, mulberry cakes, rat traps (in the Congo), and woodpecker scalps. Most of our current money is already held in digital form as electronic book entries at the bank. At first glance, bitcoin with its distributed ledger appears to be simply an advance on the current financial technology.\nIts fervid exponents have even greater hopes. They claim that crypto-currencies hail the end of state-controlled money. Their vision is borrowed from the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek, who envisaged a denationalisation of money that would bring about an end to both inflation and deflation, cure unemployment and result in the abolition of easy-money-peddling central banks, thereby limiting the reach of governments. What\u2019s not to like?\nThe trouble is that bitcoin enthusiasts confuse the characteristics of money with its nature. This is a thorny subject. Mainstream economic theory has little to say on what money is, assuming it is a contrivance simply to do away with the bother of barter. In the era when bank notes were redeemable in gold, most people believed that money had the intrinsic value of the precious metal. But as John Law, who was responsible for the Mississippi Co bubble in the early 18th century, pointed out: \u201cMoney is not the value by which goods are exchanged but the value for which they are exchanged.\u201d Simply put, gold derived much of its value from its use as money rather than the other way around.\nWhere, then, does money get its value? From the earliest times, going back at least to Mesopotamia in the third millennium B.C., money has been defined as a unit of account authorized by government for the payment of debts. The state theory of money holds that money is a credit issued by a sovereign, whose value comes from the fact that it can be used to pay taxes. Governments have tenaciously maintained control over the unit of account, a key aspect of sovereignty. The law prescribes this official money as legal tender for the repayment of debt.\nLaw and his contemporaries had another insight, namely that credit when it circulates acts as money. In the 18th century, much of what constituted money in England comprised bills of exchange issued by merchants against future receipts. At the same time, early English bankers were learning to create money through the act of lending. This bank money was backed by claims of real economic value. The credit theory of money maintains that money is just circulating credit. \u201cCurrency is ephemeral and cosmetic: it is the underlying mechanism of credit accounts and clearing that is the essence of money,\u201d Felix Martin writes in his 2013 book \u201cMoney\u201d.\nThe economic system commonly referred to as capitalism consists of a vast network of credit relations. Credit money is its key feature. Hayek, of course, realised this. His proposals to strip the government of its money monopoly envisaged the replacement of a dominant central bank with competing private money-issuing banks. Competition between the currency banks would thus produce a sounder currency. But Hayek\u2019s money would still be of the credit variety.\nBitcoin and other crypto-currencies are a different kettle of fish. They purport to be non-credit currencies - that is, monetary assets without corresponding liabilities. Yet all money is by its nature a claim upon society, otherwise it cannot be spent. And why should society wish to confer vast monetary claims on the enterprising nerds and opportunistic speculators currently in possession of crypto-fortunes? More importantly, because crypto-currencies lack a mechanism for creating credit they are not well suited to the capitalist economy. Imagine what would happen if bitcoin were accepted as the monetary unit of account. The result would be a scarcity of the digital currency followed by a severe economic contraction and stagnation without end.\nThis is not going to happen. Not just because it makes no economic sense but because governments are never going to relinquish their monopoly over money any sooner than they will surrender their monopoly on violence. However desirable in theory it may be, Hayek\u2019s proposal to denationalise money was just a pipe dream. As the Nobel laureate Quote: : \u201cEverybody knows that if such a private experiment promised to succeed, governments would at once step in to prevent it.\u201d\nEverybody, that is, apart from the speculators in crypto-currencies. Some of them privately concede that bitcoin may never become money as such, but say that it will retain value as an asset in the same way that gold survived its demonetisation. The counter-argument is that gold has a very long history, an extraordinary durability and a great inherent beauty which lends it enduring lustre, while bitcoin is just a clever piece of open-source software.\nThis is not to say that the blockchain and similar associated technologies have no future. The new high flyer, ripple, is working with banks to improve the global payments system. It\u2019s a more modest aim than creating a new class of money - but a far more practical one.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}

One right-leaning group is committed to spending at least $10 million, and a group aligned with the Koch brothers also planning a multimillion-dollar campaign. \"If we can't sell this to the American people, we ought to go into another line of work,\" Sen. Mitch McConnell told fellow Republicans last month. SHARES Aaron P. Bernstein | Reuters Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, accompanied by members of the Republican Conference, speaks at a news conference about the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., December 20, 2017. \nRepublicans scored a major legislative victory by passing their sweeping overhaul of the tax code in record time. Now, they face a task that could be just as daunting: selling the law to the American people. \nAfter spending millions of dollars last year to advance the legislation, GOP advocacy groups are unleashing millions more to ensure Republicans' hard-won policy triumph translates into a political win in time for the 2018 midterm elections. \nAhead of the Nov. 6 elections, the American Action Network is committing at least $10 million to tout the merits of the new law, starting with a $2 million TV and digital ad campaign in 23 key congressional districts. \nMeanwhile, the network of advocacy groups with ties to the billionaire Koch brothers is pledging a multimillion-dollar campaign that combines paid advertising with town halls, phone banks and grassroots actions. \n\"There's a lot of work to be done educating Americans about [tax reform's] benefits,\" said James Davis, executive vice president of Freedom Partners. \"We will make a massive push to show how pro-growth policies can revitalize the economy and open the floodgates to new opportunity, innovation and prosperity.\" \nOne PAC that's supportive of President Donald Trump is taking a more unconventional approach to winning over voters. The 45Committee, founded by wealthy Trump confidantes Sheldon Adelson and Todd Ricketts, sponsored an ad during the college football TaxSlayer Bowl that dubbed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \"the real tax slayer\" for shepherding the legislation through the narrow majority in his chamber. 'Keep it right there' \nRepublicans are counting on the rewrite of the tax code to maintain their control of Congress during this year's midterm elections. Yet the law remains deeply unpopular among the public, with many households skeptical that any benefits will trickle down to them. \nJust about a third of Americans support the new law, according to a USA Today\/Suffolk University poll last month. The survey also found about half of Americans did not believe they would enjoy a tax break under the new law. Other recent independent polls show similar results. \n\"We're going to make sure we keep it right there,\" Nicole Gill, executive director of Tax March, said of the weak poll numbers. \nTax March, part of a coalition of groups that initially organized to block the Republican tax bill, is now hoping to capitalize on the overhaul's unpopularity. Under the banner Not One Penny, it kicked off a cross-country tour on Saturday in Kansas \u2014 a state that was forced to roll back aggressive tax cuts amid steep budget shortfalls and widespread tax dodging. \"What we learned from the [2017] campaign is once people find out what's in the bill, they hate it.\" -Nicole Gill, executive director, Tax March \nThe campaign is also planning stops in contested red states with Democratic representatives, such as West Virginia, along with vulnerable blue districts like Missouri. The tour, titled \"Repeal the Trump tax,\" will include town halls and events with local officials and small-business owners. It will culminate in Washington on April 15. \nAccording to planning documents obtained by CNBC, the groups are planning to spend at least $10 million on the effort. \n\"What we learned from the [2017] campaign is once people find out what's in the bill, they hate it,\" Gill said. \nThe effort could also draw some national firepower. In a letter last week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi urged Democrats to stage teach-ins on the tax bill on Saturday, tying the campaign to the Rev. Martin Luther King's message of \"fairness and equality.\" \n\"The Republican-controlled House, Senate and White House squandered 2017 by stacking the deck for [the] privileged, the powerful and special interests and against America's middle-class families,\" the letter stated. \nThe nonpartisan Tax Policy Center recently estimated that the average tax cut for all households this year will be about $1,200, a substantial number but lower than the projected $2,059 figure that Republicans typically cite. \nThe center also found that a tax break for the top 20 percent of earners is nearly twice as large as the one for the middle class: Wealthier filers receive a 2.9 percent increase in after-tax income versus 1.6 percent for those in the middle. In addition, the tax cuts for individuals expire after 2025 under the new law, while the lower rate for corporations is permanent. Kevin Lamarque | Reuters President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Republican members of the Senate at the White House in Washington, January 4, 2018. \nRepublicans argue that reducing rates for businesses will help spur a faster economy, job creation and wage growth that are not fully captured by many independent projections.

FILE PHOTO - A North Korean flag flies on a mast at the Permanent Mission of North Korea in Geneva October 2, 2014. REUTERS\/Denis Balibouse\/File Photo \nKim Jong Un, in his annual New Year\u2019s Day speech, called for reduced tensions on the Korean peninsula and flagged the North\u2019s possible participation in the Games next month, just across the border in Pyeongchang. \nSouth Korea has been eager to involve North Korea to ensure the Games are not disrupted by any further nuclear or missile tests and as a way of re-establishing dialogue with the reclusive state. \nAnalysts say Kim\u2019s gambit is aimed at driving a wedge between Seoul and Washington, which has advocated a strategy of maximum pressure and insisted that all options, including military ones, are on the table. \nBut the move also targets the broader international consensus involving major players China, Russia and Japan that has tightened sanctions and deepened isolation for North Korea in recent months. \n\u201cA major part of the Kim family playbook is to exploit and to widen the divergences in the interests, in the first instance between the U.S. and South Korea, but more broadly among the five major neighbours,\u201d said Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia until last April and now at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \nNorth Korea has long followed such a strategy of intense provocations followed by conciliatory phases aimed at exposing rifts, he said. \n\u201cThis is a classic united we stand, divided we fall situation,\u201d Russel said. \u201cIt\u2019s always easier to maintain five party solidarity when North Korea is behaving badly.\u201d \nU.S. President Donald Trump has led a drive to step up global sanctions on North Korea as it seeks to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States. \nOn Tuesday, Trump said sanctions and other pressures were starting to have a big impact on North Korea but he withheld judgment on Pyongyang\u2019s offer to talk. \n\u201cRocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time,\u201d Trump wrote in a Twitter post, using his nickname for Kim. \u201cPerhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!\u201d \nWashington says the full cooperation of China, Russia and other countries is vital to the success of this effort, which includes significant restrictions on trade and other ties with North Korea. \nChina, which remains North Korea\u2019s major partner, has curtailed trade in line with United Nations sanctions, but Washington has called for it to do more to isolate Pyongyang. \n\u201cABSURD OVERTURE\u201d \nSouth Korea\u2019s government publicly welcomed Kim\u2019s overture, and President Moon Jae-in has pushed to ease tensions ahead of the Games by postponing joint military drills with American troops until after the Olympics. \nMoon also said on Tuesday the improvement of inter-Korean ties was linked to resolving North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme. \nThe White House has yet to make a detailed response. However, powerful Republican Senator Lindsey Graham suggested the United States would boycott the Games if North Korea attends. \n\u201cAllowing Kim Jong Un\u2019s North Korea to participate in Winter Olympics would give legitimacy to the most illegitimate regime on the planet,\u201d Graham said on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m confident South Korea will reject this absurd overture and fully believe that if North Korea goes to the Winter Olympics, we do not.\u201d \nThe participation of North Korean athletes and officials in Olympic events may create some awkward moments for international leaders who have spent months painting the country as a pariah state, said Robert Kelly, a professor at South Korea\u2019s Pusan National University. \n\u201cIt puts the South Koreans in a weird position because it potentially creates tension between U.S. and Japan who have gone to lengths to isolate the regime,\u201d he said. \nJapan\u2019s relationship with South Korea is already seen as under some strain, with one former Japanese diplomat saying Tokyo was suffering from \u201cfatigue\u201d with Seoul and lacking confidence in Moon. \nStill, analysts were sceptical Kim\u2019s gambit would do lasting damage to the alliance between Seoul and Washington, or to the international push for sanctions. \n\u201cI doubt that there will be a substantial reversal in global economic and political isolation measures in the near term,\u201d said Scott Snyder, director of U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. MORE MISSILE TESTS \nAt the heart of analysts\u2019 scepticism is Kim\u2019s apparent lack of appetite for compromise on the main points of nuclear weapons, missile testing, or human rights. \n\u201cParticipation in things like the Olympics are pseudo-concessions, because the North doesn\u2019t actually have to give up anything,\u201d Kelly said. \nIn his speech, Kim vowed he would spend 2018 \u201cmass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles\u201d to \u201cgive a spur to the efforts for deploying them for action.\u201d \nThat means further missile tests are almost certain, with more focus on \u201crealistic\u201d exercises than developmental tests, said Joshua Pollack, a senior researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California. \n\u201cThe major theme here for strategic forces is shifting from development to serial production, deployment, and increased readiness,\u201d he said. \nIf the United States wants to take advantage of any possible easing in tensions, it needs to drop its demands for a halt in testing as a precondition for talks, said Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project in New York. \n\u201cThe most important reciprocal step would be to scale back - not (just) postpone - the spring joint exercises,\u201d he said. \u201cFailure to try these steps will only ensure that unbridled North Korean weapons development continues.\u201d Reporting by David Brunnstrom in Washington and Josh Smith in Seoul; Additional reporting by Linda Sieg in Tokyo and Susan Heavey in Washington; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Alistair Bell"}

Participants also provided background information about themselves, including education level and whether English was their first language. \nIn a multiple-choice section of the questionnaire, they were asked to define: blister, ulcer, malignant, lesion and benign. In a free-written answer section, they were also asked to describe in their own words the meanings of: biopsy, tumor, lymph node, pre-malignant and metastasis. \nHayes\u2019 team found that 90 percent of respondents correctly defined blister as a bubble of fluid under the skin. Ulcer came in at a distant second with just 70 percent choosing the appropriate definition as an open sore or break in the skin. \n\u201cThe words blister and ulcer are frequently used in medical areas unrelated to dental care, which may explain why the two are the most recognized medical lexicon,\u201d Eisig noted. \u201cFor example, a patient experienced foot or hand blisters in the past. A friend or family member once had a stomach ulcer.\u201d \nForty-five percent of patients were able to define a biopsy as a test involving taking a sample, but 30 percent wrongly defined it as a test specifically for cancer. \nBenign and metastasis were the least understood terms, with 33 percent of patients responding \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d for the meaning of benign and just 6 percent correctly defining metastasis as the spread of a cancer to other areas of the body. Many patients also seemed to mistake \u201cmetastasis\u201d for other words, offering responses such as \u201cfoot bone\u201d (metatarsal) or \u201cbreast condition, very painful\u201d (mastitis). \nThe researchers found that nearly 27 percent of participants did not speak English as a first language, which is a higher rate than London as a whole, at 22 percent, they note. But when the researchers looked just at those whose first language was English, they saw no differences in the number of correct answers based on educational level. \nThe study authors did not respond to a request for comments. \nAccording to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, providers in many fields, including emergency room settings, surgery requiring anesthetics and breast cancer clinics, grapple with how best to effectively communicate with patients. \nEfforts to bridge this gap include encouraging the use of plainer language in written materials and providing interpreting services for non-English speakers. \nEisig notes that some of the biggest challenges to effectively communicating with patients stem from growing bureaucracy within healthcare and are not so easily remedied. \n\u201cOver the past decade or so there have been many changes to healthcare, many of which are driven by finances. Some of these changes aren\u2019t always beneficial,\u201d he said. \n\u201cFrequently the doctor\u2019s back may be to the patient as entries are being made into the electronic health record. Doctor-patient communication is now being done increasingly through email. These are just two examples that may lead to communication failures because practitioners are spending less time with patients, which results in diminished relationships thus increasing the likelihood for patient misinterpretation.\u201d \nSOURCE: go.nature.com\/2zMEzbt British Dental Journal, online December 1, 2017."}

That was the highest level since January 2012 and followed an upwardly revised $48.9 billion shortfall in October.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade deficit increasing to $49.5 billion in November after a previously reported $48.7 billion deficit in the prior month.\nPart of the rise in the trade deficit in November reflected price increases. When adjusted for inflation, the trade deficit rose to $66.7 billion from $65.6 billion in October. The so-called real trade deficit for October and November was above the third-quarter average of $62.0 billion.\nThat suggests trade will probably subtract from gross domestic product in the October-December quarter. The chronic trade deficit has garnered the attention of Republican President Donald Trump, who has blamed it for the massive loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs as well as moderate economic growth.\nThe government reported last month that trade contributed 0.36 percentage point to the economy's 3.2 percent annualized growth pace in the third quarter. The Trump administration believes that a smaller trade deficit, together with deep tax cuts, could boost annual economic growth to 3 percent on a sustained basis.\nImports of goods jumped to a record high of $204.0 billion in November. Capital goods imports were the highest on record. Imports of consumer goods rose to their highest level since March 2015. The strong growth in imports is being driven by robust consumer demand.\nThe country's import bill was also pushed up by imports of industrial supplies and materials, which were the highest since January 2015.\nImports from China were unchanged in November. Exports of goods increased 2.3 percent to $200.2 billion in November, the highest on record. There were strong increases in exports of industrial supplies, petroleum and capital goods.\nOverall exports of goods are being supported by recent dollar depreciation and a strengthening global economy, which is helping to underpin the manufacturing sector.\nExports to China fell 1.9 percent.

But while bitcoin and opaque virtual currencies can provide sources of cash for political pariahs, the market\u2019s still too nascent to make a meaningful skirting of a U.S.-led economic blockade possible. \nAny autocrat eyeing bitcoin as a sanctions safe haven must confront a simple matter of scale. All the world\u2019s digital tokens are worth about $700 billion, according to Coinmarketcap.com. That\u2019s about one-seventh of the daily foreign exchange market. \n\u201cThink about how many U.S. dollars are in circulation and how much each bitcoin would have to be worth to match that value \u2014 it would be a ludicrously big number,\u201d said Tom Uren, a visiting fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute\u2019s International Cyber Policy Centre. \u201cIn the long term, that\u2019s possible, but we are talking decades and decades. Cash isn\u2019t going away any time soon.\u201d Curbing the market \nMoreover, regulators are quickly moving to rein in digital currencies. China\u2019s central bank declared initial coin offerings illegal in September. And on Thursday, South Korea\u2019s justice minister reiterated a proposal to ban cryptocurrency exchanges altogether. Yonhap New Agency reported Saturday that authorities asked banks to adopt real-name digital currency accounts. \nFor more on Bitcoin, watch Fortune\u2019s video: \nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., on Friday he was \u201cnot at all\u201d worried that Russia or others countries could use digital tokens to evade sanctions. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a concern,\u201d Mnuchin said, noting that digital coin exchanges were subject to the same requirements as banks to scrutinize who their customers are. \nThe U.S. sanctions people and organizations, not assets, and those measures still apply to states that park their earnings in cryptocurrencies. Even if Maduro can overcome investor skepticism and attract support to Venezuela\u2019s oil-backed \u201cpetro,\u201d those who use the token could find themselves ensnared by sanctions. \n\u201cThe detail of how you issue it is critical because you have to trust the currency and there has to be a market for it,\u201d said Jim Fitzsimmons, a director at Control Risks in Singapore. \u201cVenezuela is having a really bad time. I just don\u2019t see how the gee-wizzery cryptocurrency stuff is going to help.\u201d \nIn Russia, the central bank opposes a finance ministry effort \u2014 announced Thursday \u2014 to allow cryptocurrency trading on official exchanges. Undeterred, Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev told reporters the ministry would use the \u201cpower of thoughts and words\u201d to convince the central bank. \nUsing digital currencies to evade sanctions would be particularly problematic for petro-states that need access to the mainstream financial system \u2014 especially U.S. dollars \u2014 to sell their oil. Iran\u2019s economy, for instance, is too big for bitcoin to serve as savior. \nStill, cryptocurrencies do open new avenues for isolated regimes and their political elite to smuggle cash across borders, especially for smaller, impoverished states like North Korea. North Korean hackers seized a South Korean server last summer and used it to mine digital coins worth about $25,000, according to Kwak Kyoung-ju, who leads a hacking analysis team at the South Korean government-backed Financial Security Institute. \nSouth Korean investigators are also probing if North Korean cyber thieves were responsible for the December collapse of a Seoul-based cryptocurrency exchange, which lost 17% of its assets. \n\u201cThese things are an incredible asset for criminals and governments who want to do illicit things because they are decentralized, they are not regulated, and there is a lot of anonymity,\u201d said Tim Wellsmore, Canberra-based Asia-Pacific director of threat intelligence at FireEye Inc., a cyber security company. They are total freedom, \u201copen slather,\u201d he said. \nDigital currencies offer states a covert way to fund other sorts of mischief, such as financing armed rebel groups or bribing politicians, said ASPI\u2019s Uren. But something like a cyber-attack on a country\u2019s electric grid may be cheaper and more disruptive. \nOn Friday, Mnuchin said he was mostly concerned about bitcoin\u2019s potential to be used in crimes, such as money laundering. He said he was working with U.S. and foreign regulators to closely monitor its use. \n\u201cWe want to make sure that bad people cannot use these currencies to do bad things,\u201d he said.

REUTERS\/Jason Lee\/File Photo According to the U.S. investment bank Citi, the top 10 China developers are forecast to achieve close to 35 percent market share this year, up from around 27 percent now. They held just 14.2 percent of the market in 2012.\nThe number of developers posting more than 50 billion yuan in sales increased to 40 in 2017 from 25 in 2016, with sales growth of 53 percent to 84 percent, real estate developer CREIS said. The number of smaller developers, with sales between 10 billion and 50 billion yuan, fell to 104 from 106.\nAnd although the total number of home transactions is expected to drop about 5 percent, securities firms and rating agency analysts said Hong Kong-listed developers could see 30 percent sales growth on average this year, compared with an average of 40 percent growth in 2017.\nBut the growth will not be without risk. Ramped-up land purchases mean the developers will add debt, throwing uncertainty into the stated plans of some to deleverage.\nChina Evergrande ( 3333.HK ) and Sunac China ( 1918.HK ) had the highest gearing ratios at more than 200 percent in the first half of last year. Both said in October they intended to reduce their debt ratio, but neither halted their buying sprees.\nIf there is a market correction, developers\u2019 liquidity will be tested. But Standard & Poor director Christopher Yip said even in that scenario, he didn\u2019t see a large impact.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be a big probability for rated developers to be unable to repay their debt other than very weak ones with poor liquidity and refinancing prospects; others should have secured the financing before they buy land,\u201d Yip said.\nSeveral major developers told Reuters that they were confident in double-digit sales growth this year. The companies could not be identified as the information is not yet public.\n\u201cLast year we sold so many flats, we\u2019ll need to replenish; our land acquisition budget has to be larger than last year because our size is also larger,\u201d said a senior executive of a Shanghai-based developer, who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media.\nA softening but still resilient property market, underpinned by steady prices, would be welcome news for both China\u2019s policymakers and developers. Beijing is eager to keep the market stable as the government tackles an alarming build-up in debt.\nMany investors are overlooking debt risks and focusing more on revenue, as evidenced by surging share prices.\nChina property stocks were among the best performers in Hong Kong in 2017, propelled by robust sales, with Evergrande up 480 percent, Sunac jumping 460 percent, and Country Garden ( 2007.HK ) climbing 270 percent. Nine other developers saw shares surge more than two-fold.\nSome analysts questioned whether the expansion rate of China\u2019s largest developers could be sustained.\n\u201cChina\u2019s property shares rallied in 2017 thanks to top-line growth, but this momentum will slow in 2018. The growth story this year will be weaker,\u201d said CLSA analyst Nicole Wong. \u201cLast year, many sales were from smaller cities, but as liquidity tightens, sales to these cities will be more difficult.\u201d\nThe price to earnings ratio of the China property sector rebounded last year after the share rally, but it was still at relatively low levels.\nBUYING SPREE The larger developers, despite sounding notes of caution, have continued to aggressively pursue growth.\nAccording to data by property researcher CREIS, Evergrande bought a total gross floor area of 16.2 million square meters in the second half of 2017, compared to 9.7 million in the first six months, via both public land auction and mergers and acquisitions. Sunac bought 520,000 square meters in the second half, a slowdown from 1.4 million from January to June.\nCountry Garden, China Vanke ( 2202.HK ) ( 2.SZ ) and Evergrande breached the 500 billion yuan ($76.93 billion) mark for annual sales for the first time in 2017, according to CREIS.\nTop-performing developers spent 40 to 50 percent of their sales revenue on land acquisitions last year, CREIS said, much higher than smaller rivals, which spent 27-36 percent of sales revenue.\nWhile big companies splurged 74 percent more on land purchases than the previous year, a bigger percentage rise went to smaller cities as tightening policies took hold elsewhere.\nChina has imposed measures to crack down on property speculation since early 2016, and China\u2019s home price growth is likely to stall in 2018 as the boom in smaller cities is expected to lose steam, while measures to tighten credit and other property curbs constrain the market, a Reuters poll showed.\n($1 = 6.4995 Chinese yuan renminbi)\nReporting by Clare Jim; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Gerry Doyle\n "}

Citic Securities, China's largest brokerage, is one of the banks involved, added one of them.\nA spokesman for Citic Securities declined to comment.\nWanda's businesses range from real estate to football and cinemas but it has been rattled in the past year by a government-led crackdown on overseas deals and high leverage. The company is owned by Wang Jianlin, one of China's richest men.\nAn IPO of Wanda's sports assets would include Infront Sports & Media AG, a Swiss sports marketing company and World Triathlon Corp, the organizer and promoter of the Ironman race, according to three of the people.\nThe two were acquired in 2015 for $1.2 billion and $650 million respectively.\nThe share offering would also include Wanda's smaller sports assets in China, such as cycling and basketball leagues, one of them said. The public float would not involve Wanda's 20 percent stake in the Spanish football club Atletico Madrid, valued at 67 million euros after a recent capital raise, the source said.\nThe IPO would most likely take place in Hong Kong, but bankers have also pitched for a U.S. listing, according to the people.\nWanda is separately looking to sell Sunseeker International, a British yacht maker it bought in 2013 for $495 million but whose financial performance it has failed to turn around, two other people said.\nWanda declined to comment. The people could not be named as the plans are confidential.\nWanda's interest in property, sports and entertainment - accounting for more than $13 billion of its deals in the past five years - ran into official opposition last year when Beijing labelled overseas deals in those areas \"irrational\".\nIn addition to sports, its holdings also include the cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings and movie studio Legendary Entertainment.\nThe company is also considering the merits of a pre-IPO funding round for the sports unit, according to one of the people. All plans are still at an early stage however as Wanda is seeking a chief financial officer for the sports business to lead the fundraising efforts, said another of the people.\nProperty forms the basis of the Wanda empire - its mixed use Wanda Plaza developments are common across China - but this too has put pressure on Wang's business.\nLast year, Chinese regulators told banks to stop providing funding for several of its overseas acquisitions as Beijing looks to curb the conglomerate's offshore buying spree.\nShortly after, Wanda sold a portfolio of hotels and tourism assets, including 13 theme parks, for $9 billion to Guangzhou R&F Properties and Sunac China.

{"published":"2018-01-06T10:31:00.000+02:00","title":"China cries 'Wolf!' Should Hollywood worry? | Fortune","text":"8:31 AM EST \nGood morning and happy new year! \nOver the past decade, China has emerged as the world\u2019s No. 1 consumer in a slew of important product categories: autos , mobile phones , semiconductors , elevators , luxury goods , beer , soy beans , pork , online games and men\u2019s skin care . Hollywood has long salivated over the prospect that films, too, would be added to that list. \nThe breakneck growth of China\u2019s box office between 2010 and 2015\u2014when ticket sales soared from $1.51 billion to $6.8 billion\u2014led many US film industry analysts to predict that 2017 would be the year China finally overtook the United States as the world\u2019s No. 1 movie market. Alas, a shock slump in 2016 , when China\u2019s movie box office actually declined in dollar terms to $6.58 billion, forced an industry-wide reassessment . Some experts warned China\u2019s ascendence as No. 1 might not happen until well into the next decade . \nWell, the 2017 box office numbers are finally in. China\u2019s media regulator\u2014the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (a.k.a. SARFT)\u2014 reported last week that in 2017 China had total ticket sales of $8.59 billion. That fell well short of North American box office for 2017, estimated by comScore at $11.12 billion. Even so, analysts cheered the results as a healthy recovery for China. \nChina\u2019s box office rebound should give Hollywood reason to rejoice. Since 1994, when China\u2019s communist rulers eased a long-standing ban on all foreign films, growth in China\u2019s box office has translated into hefty profits for US studios and distributors. Beijing replaced the ban with a quota system that limited the number of foreign films that could be screened per year, imposed strict rules on content, and restricted foreign distributors\u2019 share of China ticket sales. U.S. filmmakers complained, but eventually learned to live with the proscriptions because American movies were so more popular (and profitable) than films produced in China. Blockbusters like Avatar and Titanic proved smash hits in China, raking in hundreds of millions of dollars. Many titles\u2014including Pacific Rim , Transformers: Age of Extinction and Furious 7\u2014 earned far more money in China than they did in North America. Even films like Warcraft , which was pulled from American cinemas after less than a week, could hit the jackpot in China. In dollar terms, China\u2019s ticket sales for 2017 grew 30% from last year. In North America, meanwhile, 2017 ticket sales dropped 2.3% from 2016\u2019s record $11.4 billion. International films\u2014most of them U.S.-made\u2014claimed 46% of revenue in 2017, up from a 42% in 2016 and 38% in 2015. \nAnd yet, there are clear signs Hollywood\u2019s dominance of China\u2019s film scene has begun to fade. No fewer than four of the five highest grossing movies in China last year were locally produced. By far the biggest blockbuster was Wolf Warrior 2 , a jingoistic action film depicting the exploits of a Rambo-like former Peoples Liberation Army soldier who rushes to the rescue of Chinese nationals in Africa, pulverizing an American villain in the process. Wolf Warrior, which premiered in July, took in a record-shattering $854 million. The New Yorker \u2018s Evan Osnos has penned a thoughtful essay on why such a nationalistic film seems to have struck such a powerful chord with Chinese audiences. (Beijing is so chuffed with Wolf Warrior that it has selected it for the best foreign-language film category of the 2018 Academy Awards.) \nChina\u2019s second-most popular film in 2017 was The Fate of the Furious, which grossed less than half of Wolf Warrior. The next three most popular titles were all made in China: Never Say Die, about a boxer who magically switches bodies with a female reporter trying to expose him for taking bribes; Kung Fu Yoga , an action comedy starring Jacky Chan; and Journey to the West: Demons Strike Back, a fantasy adventure directed by Tsui Hark. \nIn recent weeks, despite a full scale marketing blitz by Disney , Star Wars: The Last Jedi , has left Chinese audiences underwhelmed . Instead, the hot ticket is Youth , a film depicting the triumphs and trevails of a group of young girls in a Chinese military performing arts troupe during the Cultural Revolution. \nAll of which suggests to me that the arc of China\u2019s film industry may follow that of many other product categories in the country. As China\u2019s economy matures and homegrown challengers come into their own, global players increasingly find themselves forced to scramble more frantically than ever to hang on to a shrinking share of a growing market. \nMore China news below. @claychandler Trade and Economy \nChina\u2019s GDP revision. China has lowered its final 2016 gross domestic product figure to 74.36 trillion yuan ($11.47 trillion) from 54.2 billion yuan in initial estimates, due to a lower estimate in the services sector. The annual GDP growth rate remained unchanged at 6.7 percent.

Jia Yueting, the billionaire founder of LeEco, a troubled Chinese tech company once billed as the Netflix of China, has defied an order issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to return to China from the U.S. by the end of 2017 to sort out his mounting financial debt.

{"published":"2018-01-07T00:49:00.000+02:00","title":"HubPages sells to Maven, giving venture investors exit after 12 years","text":"Silicon Valley celebrates the massive exits and the brilliant entrepreneurs behind them. There's Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg , Snap's Evan Spiegel, Salesforce's Marc Benioff and Twitter's Evan Williams, just to name a few. \nBut the overwhelming majority of start-up founders are a lot more like Paul Edmondson than any of the aforementioned celebrities.\nEdmondson poured 12 years of money, sweat and tears into HubPages. He raised $8 million from venture capitalists in the early days before hitting a wall \u2014 and then another wall \u2014 and then falling out of favor with tech's financiers. \nOn Friday morning, Edmondson finally got his exit. HubPages, a collection of websites that cover topics ranging from pets and cars to healthy living, was acquired by a Seattle-based content company named Maven , which has a market value below $70 million and a stock that trades over-the-counter (OTC).\nTerms of the deal weren't fully disclosed, but the general structure calls for HubPages' investors to get $5 million and for company founders and employees to receive a combination of cash and shares that could be worth another $10 million to $15 million, based on performance metrics and stock appreciation over the next three years.\nExistential threats The story didn't get any pickup, not even from the reliable tech blogs. Edmondson called to tell me about the deal, not so much because he wanted a story, but because we've spoken many times in recent years about the deep existential challenges that companies like his face in a world where so much traffic comes from Google search. \nEdmondson was excited because he'd found a home for himself and his 32 employees (including eight that start on Monday) and he's giving them a chance to own stock with potential upside. \n\"When you're trapped inside small private companies, you don't have a way for you or your employees to get liquid,\" Edmondson said. He added that he's been paying himself a \"below-market salary.\"\nEdmondson's team will double the size of Maven, which similarly operates a network of websites on topics from chocolate to economics. Both companies have been trying to build a business that can survive without reliance on Google and Facebook , which control about two-thirds of the U.S. digital ad market, according to eMarketer . \nshow chapters How to find out what Facebook knows about you      4:30 PM ET Wed, 3 Jan 2018 | 01:58 HubPages attracts more than 35 million visitors a month through its 27 domains. Close to 70 percent of that traffic is now on mobile, Edmondson said.\nThe business has stabilized since 2016, when HubPages narrowed its focus to those 27 particular subjects and committed to obtaining premium content that could be edited by in-house professionals. \nIn previous years, HubPages' success was tied to Google and fluctuated based on whatever the web giant did with its search engine. For example, in May 2015, HubPages saw its traffic plunge 22 percent in one week after Google suddenly lowered the visibility of how-to sites. Like with most of Google's algorithm changes, there was no warning and no explanation.\n\"Imagine how hard it is to run a business when you see 22 percent of your traffic evaporate overnight,\" Edmondson told CNBC for a story about that change, which was dubbed \"Phantom 2\" by one analyst. \nIt was just the latest in a series of hits that HubPages had faced over the years. Building an independent online media company has mostly been a losing model, as ad dollars have concentrated in the hands of the giant internet and entertainment businesses.\nHubPages was able to raise venture money in 2007 and 2008, and then never again.\nFar from taking a breather, Edmondson is now likely to be working even harder. The company has performance targets it has to meet for him to maximize his pay, and he also wants to do what he can to help Maven's stock. \nAs an OTC company, Maven shares are highly volatile and thinly traded. After the announcement on Friday, the stock jumped as much as 32 percent to $2.57, before closing up 6.6 percent at $1.95. \nMaven CEO James Heckman knows the internet ad and content market, having previously served as the chief media strategist at Yahoo and chief strategy officer at Fox Interactive Media. He said that Maven's goal is to build a publishing business that's not beholden to the Google-Facebook duopoly. That requires acquiring premium content sites with a technology platform that allows advertisers to promote across the network.\n\"Paul and I are aligned because we both agree that mom-and-pop or small publishers no longer have a sustainable business,\" Heckman said in an interview. \"It's over.\""}

But happiness expert and bestselling author Annie McKee wants people to escape this harmful cycle. \n\"If you have adopted that mindset that says, 'Work is grueling, just be happy you have a job, that you're getting a paycheck, it's a good company,' but you're not actually happy, you don't have to accept that,\" McKee tells CNBC Make It . \n\"Everyone deserves to be happy at work because if we're not happy at work, we're not happy in life,\" she adds. show chapters 11:05 AM ET Fri, 15 Dec 2017 | 01:04 \nAs a leadership adviser for Fortune 500 companies and governments around the world, McKee has spent decades researching effectiveness and happiness at work. She details portions of this research in her latest book: \" How to Be Happy at Work: The Power of Purpose, Hope, and Friendship .\" \n\"There are three ways to tell if things are not well,\" McKee says. \"There are physical clues that tell us something is wrong, emotional clues based on how we feel on a daily basis over time and clues from the health of our relationships.\" \nIf you have seen your unhappiness at work taking a toll on other areas of your life, such as your sleeping patterns, nutrition or family relationships, McKee recommends that you follow these two steps to regain a sense of purpose and happiness. Step one: Reflect \nOnce you understand you aren't happy at work, the first thing McKee recommends that you do is carve out some time for deep reflection and introspection. Ask yourself, \"What is causing me to feel sad or unhappy at work?\" \n\"It's far too easy to habitually tell yourself, 'I'm sad because don't like my manager' or 'I'm sad because didn't get promotion'\" McKee says. \"And while those things might be true, there's almost always something deeper than that.\" show chapters 1:00 PM ET Tue, 20 Dec 2016 | 01:25 \nMcKee further recommends that you be honest with yourself and ask if there is something about your own mindset and life that may be contributing to your unhappiness at work. \n\"Have you gotten trapped by overwork? Has your ambition gotten out of control? Have you chosen jobs and work projects because you think you should or because you actually want to?\" McKee says. \"Don't get caught in these traps.\" Step two: Find a friend \nWhether it's at work or outside of work, McKee suggests finding a friend to discuss this state of being with. \n\"Find someone who you can really talk with, who can really tell you the truth about what they see in you, whether it's the strengths or some developmental areas they see in you,\" McKee says. show chapters 12:22 PM ET Tue, 21 Nov 2017 | 00:59 \nYour friend can help you decide if you seem to fit in with your current workplace or if the job is not the right fit for you. \n\"Talking with a friend as if they were your [career] coach could also help you see your attitude about work from a different perspective,\" McKee says. \"And be open to all possibilities. Maybe you need to change your mindset, maybe you need to change what you do on a daily basis\" \n\"We have a lot more freedom than we like to think we do,\" she adds."}

He worked with us and I think he could be in contention for the Norwich game (on Saturday),\u201d Conte told a news conference ahead of Wednesday\u2019s league game at Arsenal. \n\u201cI\u2018m very happy to work with these players. I don\u2019t see a problem.\u201d \nHowever, he did not rule out completely the possibility that some unsettled players might move on. \u201cI understand if some players are not playing regularly and want to leave,\u201d he said. \nBut he added: \u201cMy expectation is all the players we have in the squad will stay here and continue to work. Our squad is not big and for this reason it\u2019s impossible to send on loan or sell one player if we don\u2019t sign another player.\u201d \nThe Italian also dismissed reports that Chelsea were trying to sign Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini, whose contract with the Serie A side expires at the end of June. \n\u201cGiorgio is a fantastic player but I think he wants to finish his career at Juventus. I think it\u2019s right to finish his career in this way,\u201d Conte -- a former Juventus manager -- added. \n\u201cA lot of speculation is normal when the transfer window starts. It\u2019s a difficult moment for every coach.\u201d \nConte also said that Chelsea would not recall any of their players who are on loan at other clubs in January. \nChampions Chelsea, who are third in the league, travel to fifth-placed Arsenal followed by an FA Cup tie at Norwich City on Saturday.

Olson today released her 2017 Annual Report to Congress , describing challenges the IRS will face as it implements the recently enacted tax reform legislation and unveiling a new publication, \"The Purple Book,\" describing 50 legislative recommendations intended to strengthen taxpayer rights and improve tax administration. The report also examines a range of other tax administration issues.\nThe NTA's report says the reduction in IRS funding since FY 2010 has challenged the agency's ability to perform basic tasks of administering the tax system. \"I see the consequences of reduced IRS funding and the choices made by the agency in the face of these funding constraints,\" Olson wrote. \"Funding cuts have rendered the IRS unable to provide acceptable levels of taxpayer service, update its technology to improve its efficiency and effectiveness, and maintain compliance programs that both promote compliance and protect taxpayer rights. 'Shortcuts' have become the norm, and 'shortcuts' are incompatible with high-quality tax administration.\"\nWhile Ms. Olson said the IRS needs additional funding, she also expressed concern that the agency has sometimes been too quick to cite funding constraints as a basis for inaction. \"[L]imited resources cannot be used as an all-purpose excuse for mediocrity,\" she wrote. \"There is not a day that goes by inside the agency when someone proposes a good idea only to be told, 'We don't have the resources.'\" Notwithstanding funding constraints, she said there are steps the IRS can take to improve taxpayer service through creativity and innovation.\nStill, the report says the implementation of major tax legislation is always a heavy lift for the agency. A preliminary estimate from the IRS projected it would require additional funding of $495 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2019.\n\"The IRS will have many issues to work through, and taxpayers will have questions. But with more funding, strong leadership, and a closer working relationship with Congress, I am convinced the IRS can do the job well,\" Olson said.\nIn the Advocate's new \"Purple Book,\" she suggests Congress codify both the Taxpayer Bill of Rights and the IRS mission statement as Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nThis year's report identifies 21 problems, makes dozens of recommendations for administrative change, makes 11 recommendations for legislative change, analyzes the 10 tax issues most frequently litigated in the federal courts, and presents 7 research studies and 2 literature reviews.\nProblems addressed include:\nPrivate Debt Collection. Online Taxpayer Accounts. Taxpayer Rights in \"Real\" vs. \"Unreal\" Audits. Streamlined Section 501(c)(3) Approval Process (1023 EZ). Passport Denial and Revocation.\nVolume 2 of the report contains or outlines research studies on seven additional topics related to taxpayers.

The conference will be hosted by the International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation and sponsored by Tax Analysts. Registration is now open on the Taxpayer Rights Conference website. \"The International Conferences on Taxpayer Rights broadened the focus on taxpayer rights beyond the United States.

The lovely exterior styling and a high-class interior would pass in a car costing thousands more than the $34,695 Mazda 6 Grand Touring. If you want a powerful and quick car, it may be worth waiting for Mazda's turbocharged version of the Mazda 6 to land in showrooms in 2018. Mack Hogan | CNBC The 2017 Mazda 6 \nThe Mazda 6 has every excuse to be a phoned-in, forgettable car. \nInstead, it's absolutely brilliant. The Mazda 6 Grand Touring model we reviewed was pleasing to look at, fun to drive, comfortable to spend time in \u2014 and jam-packed with every gizmo and feature you might want in a car. \nTaken as a whole, it's easily one of the best buys on the market today. Here's why. Exterior: Three years on and still looking new Mack Hogan | CNBC The side of the 2017 Mazda 6 \nMazda has the most coherent and consistently stellar styling languages in the automotive market. While competitors tend towards soap-bar blob shapes or angular, death-machine aesthetics, Mazda walks a different path. \nThat's evident on the Mazda 6 Grand Touring, where the flowing lines that define Mazda's corporate design visually lengthen the car and give it a fantastic, athletic look. It's not easy to make front-wheel drive cars look sporty with their awkward, nose-heavy proportions. Yet Mazda nailed it, again. \nThe only real problem reveals itself at night. There's an LED strip that frames the lower lip of the grille that lights up with the headlights. \nI know what you're thinking: A lighting element that exists purely to show the shape of my grille at night sounds preposterous and idiotic. And you're right. Interior: Keeping it classy Mack Hogan | CNBC Note the heads-up display above the steering wheel \nAny grille-related tomfoolery is quickly forgotten once you're inside. Mazda has created a class-leading cabin, with a design that mimics Audis of late. Hey, if you're going to steal, steal from the best. \nThe lower half of the dash is minimalist, with important climate controls and seat heaters mounted easily within reach. The rotary controller for the infotainment system is placed right where your hand would naturally fall, and is flanked by the equally-critical volume knob. \nThe screen for the command center is placed at eye level, pasted on top of the dash. It's a touch screen and you're welcome to use it as such, but the rotary knob is the primary method of entry, and the system is designed around it. Mack Hogan | CNBC The Grand Touring model has a nicer interior \nWhile the design is certainly fit for a luxury car, the materials used are more fit for the Mazda's price point. That's not at all to say the materials are cheap \u2014 they're fantastic for the class \u2014 but don't expect the high-dollar leathers, metals and woods you'd find in a luxury car. Instead, there's lots of soft-touch black plastics. \nFinally, Mazda added a heads-up display to show navigation, speed and other information directly to the driver. It's the first I've used that works with polarized sunglasses. It's a little detail, but it shows that Mazda pays attention. Driving Experience: \"Slow car fast\" Mack Hogan | CNBC The driver seat of the 2017 Mazda 6 \nRecall that Mazda is the same company that makes the Miata, the epitome of the \"slow car fast\" mantra. That is, the idea that it's more fun to drive a slow car at the absolute edge of its performance than it is to drive a fast car on public roads, where you can't explore the limits of its grip. \nThat's the way you drive the Mazda. Its engine is 2.5 liters and naturally aspirated, making 184 horsepower. In a car of this size, that puts it firmly in the \"slow car\" category. Not too slow, in my opinion, but slow enough that if you're used to a V6 or a turbo mill you should hold off until the turbocharged version of the Mazda 6 hits showroom floors in 2018. \nAs per usual, Mazda has crushed the competition when it comes to steering feel and chassis composure. To be sure, it's still a midsize sedan and won't fool you into thinking it's a canyon-carving monster. But it's still more of a driver's car than the midsize cars that Toyota, Ford and Chevy will sell you. Mack Hogan | CNBC Wheels on the 2017 Mazda 6 Grand Touring \nSurprisingly, the chassis engineers didn't sacrifice comfort to make this happen. On the road, the Mazda 6 feels as compliant and soft as the class leaders. Team that with a surprisingly long cruising range, and you'll be able to knock out massive road trips without feeling uncomfortable or needing to fill up. \nThe Mazda 6 comes with the usual slew of active safety equipment like adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist and automatic emergency braking. These systems fall a step behind the cutting edge, though. Mack Hogan | CNBC The back of the 2017 Mazda 6 \nThe adaptive cruise control, for instance, doesn't work below 20 miles per hour, and the lane keeping assist only nudges you into the lane if you drift out, rather than the more advanced lane-centering systems that Subaru, Honda and others offer. \nIt's worth noting that the 2018 model will also include improved driver assistance tech, so if that's important to you it may be worth waiting. Value: An undeniable bargain Mack Hogan | CNBC Enough room for the family \nAt $34,695 as tested with the Grand Touring trim, there isn't much question that the Mazda 6 is an incredible value. The ride-handling balance could embarrass some luxury cars, the styling is elegant, and the car is whisper-quiet \u2014 even with noisy winter tires for shoes. Mack Hogan | CNBC The front of the 2017 Mazda 6 \nIt also comes with everything you could conceivably need: blind-spot monitoring, rear-view camera, LED lighting, heated steering wheel and seats, a solid Bose-branded audio system and automatic high beams. \nYou're also welcome to explore the lower end of the Mazda 6 lineup, all of which come reasonably well-equipped. They'll all have the same great road manners and driving dynamics, shoved into the same lovely body. I'd recommend splurging on the $300 \"Soul Red Metallic\" paint, because a great car deserves a great color. Final Thoughts Mack Hogan | CNBC A rear shot of the 2017 Mazda 6 \nYou might not be able to fit your entire family into a midsize sedan. Maybe you have to haul stuff often, or you need four-wheel drive with your snow tires to survive your area's winter. Maybe the $22,995 entry price for a Mazda 6 is outside your budget. \nBut for the rest of you, let me offer the most ringing endorsement I've ever given a car. The Mazda 6 Grand Touring is undoubtedly one of the most impressive and fantastic cars on sale today. \nIf you can make one work for your life you'd be absolutely bonkers not to give it a serious look. \nRating: "}

Soaring demand for properties and a rapid build-up in debt had stoked fears of potential fallout in the world's second-largest economy, which would have had global consequences.\n\"I think in terms of the physical market, we think sales volume will moderate but not necessarily collapse. So, we've got national sales volume slowing to around zero percent,\" Kim Wright, UBS global head of real estate equities research, told CNBC on Monday from the UBS Greater China Conference in Shanghai.\nChinese authorities have rolled out a flurry of measures since 2016 to tame the overheated property market, including restrictions on home purchases and higher mortgage down payments.\nBut the clampdown seemed to have benefited the large real estate companies such as Country Garden and China Vanke , which have gained market share as smaller players exit the increasingly tough sector. Just a week into the new year, shares of both companies have climbed close to 20 percent for 2018.\nTheir prospects in the coming months will depend on how they hold up against a slowing property sector , Wright said.\n\"The performance of the companies will depend a little bit on how well they can continue to gain market share,\" she added."}

The decision comes and between 9 and 12 months ahead of Wall Street's expectations, J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Weinstein wrote in a note following the announcement.\nThe product is the first continuous glucose monitor on the market that doesn't require patients to prick their finger to draw blood. Analysts had expected Abbott to gain from FreeStyle Libre even before Thursday's announcement because the company is aggressively pricing and marketing the new technology.\nYet they saw limits from patients having to pay for it out-of-pocket while Abbott waited for coverage approval from insurance companies and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. CMS oversees federal health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nJ.P. Morgan on Tuesday had estimated FreeStyle Libre to generate $68 million in sales in 2018, with upside up to about $100 million if Abbott secured either commercial reimbursement, Medicare reimbursement, or labeling for kids earlier than expected.\nThe announcement pits Abbott against rival Dexcom in the battle for Medicare patients. Dexcom's G5 system requires calibration, while Abbott's does not. Dexcom expects to introduce its own system that doesn't require fingerstick testing by the end of the year.\nMedicare patients will choose between Abbott's FreeStyle Libre and Dexcom's G5 based on features and ease of use because the cost is the same, Weinstein wrote. Dexcom's device has Bluetooth connectivity, but the feature isn't available for Medicare patients.\n\"So for elderly Medicare patients, the choice is the very easy to use non-continuous Libre, or the somewhat more complicated G5, but without the online features,\" Weinstein wrote. \"As the price to the patient is the same, the easy to use option will certainly be appealing to an elderly population.\"\nShares of Abbott about flat Thursday, while shares of Dexcom fell about 10 percent."}

So we appealed.\" The appeal was filed on Dec. 29.\nA TransCanada official declined to comment.\nThe proposed pipeline has been a lightning rod of controversy for nearly a decade, pitting environmentalists worried about spills and global warming against business advocates who say the project will lower fuel prices, shore up national security and bring jobs.\nThe Trump administration granted TransCanada a federal permit for the pipeline in March, reversing a decision by former President Barack Obama to reject the project on environmental grounds. That left Nebraska - the only one of three states that had not approved a route for the line - as the final hurdle.\nTransCanada has said it expects enough commercial support to make the project viable, though it has not made a final investment decision.

{"published":"2018-01-09T01:00:00.000+02:00","title":"RPT-As China restricts scrap, metal companies look to process copper abroad","text":"(Repeats story that ran on Monday)\nBy Tom Daly\nBEIJING, Jan 8 (Reuters) - As China tightens restrictions on imports of foreign waste, Chinese metal recyclers and even smelters like Jiangxi Copper Co are increasingly looking to use Southeast Asian countries as an alternative location for the processing of copper scrap.\nChina relies on imports for around half of its scrap copper needs but told the World Trade Organization last year that it would stop accepting certain types of foreign solid waste, including metals, from 2018 if they did not meet stricter impurity thresholds.\nAnalysts say this cuts off a key source of supply for the world\u2019s largest copper consumer and boosts refined copper makers, which are likely to see an increase in demand. Shanghai copper futures were roiled last year by China\u2019s moves to ban imports of Category 7 scrap - such as coiled copper cable and waste motors - from 2019, with import quotas already starting to dry up.\nAnd, in a more immediate development, traders in China now find themselves unable to import scrap copper if they cannot show they are scrap end-users.\nManson Zeng, an entrepreneur based in China\u2019s bustling southern Guangdong province, decided to set up a trading platform for waste recyclers after realizing the policy changes would spell the end for his own waste import business.\nHe estimated that several hundred of the platform\u2019s members had gone to Southeast Asian countries to develop their businesses or were preparing moves.\nIn the case of copper, the idea is to perform dismantling work overseas on Category 7 scrap procured from countries like the United States and convert it into higher-grade material that would not be subject to China\u2019s new import restrictions.\nElton Xu, the foreign trade department manager at Zili Copper Industry Co, a recycler of scrap copper in Hangzhou, said his company has started building a new processing factory in Thailand because of the policy changes.\nHaving visited several potential sites in Southeast Asia, Zili decided to set up shop in an industrial park in Rayong on the Gulf of Thailand.\nThe project, due to start up by the end of 2018, \u201cwill produce 50,000 tonnes per year of copper blister from 200,000 tonnes of hazardous waste and other complex materials,\u201d Xu said, adding that this would help Zili increase its annual output of copper cathode - used to make copper rods and wire - of 150,000 tonnes. Copper blister is partly purified copper.\nEYEING SOUTHEAST ASIA China\u2019s top three sources of scrap copper in 2017 were Hong Kong, the United States and Australia, which accounted for around 45 percent of imports in the first 11 months of the year.\nBut customs data also point to a booming copper scrap trade between China and Southeast Asia. In the January-November period, Chinese imports of copper scrap from Thailand jumped 94.9 percent year on year to 146,185 tonnes. That followed a 355 percent jump in 2016 from the previous year.\nTwo other emerging Southeast Asian scrapyards, Malaysia and the Philippines, were also among China\u2019s top 10 scrap copper suppliers, the latter\u2019s shipments jumping by over 520 percent.\nA source at one scrap recycler in Malaysia said more Chinese companies had been setting up plants in the country over the past couple of years, importing scrap copper from around the world. But she said they only took high-quality copper scrap.\nVietnam, Indonesia, Myanmar, Laos and India were named by industry sources as possible alternative scrap-processing destinations.\nAnd it is not just small, private players weighing such moves. Even the state-run Jiangxi Copper , which uses scrap as well as copper concentrate to make refined copper, is considering setting up facilities in Southeast Asia because of the import ban, company sources said.\n\u201cWe want to find a country where it\u2019s convenient to ship to China,\u201d one Jiangxi Copper official said, adding that the company planned to send out teams to assess conditions on the ground. The official requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. A Jiangxi Copper spokeswoman said she was unaware of the plans.\nA shift of Chinese processing capacity \u201cwill inevitably happen in other Asian countries, typically less mature economies,\u201d Michael Lion, president of Lion Consulting Asia, said at the Asia Copper Week conference in November. But he said that such facilities \u201cdo not exist to the extent they do in China\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t be recreated overnight.\u201d\nScrap companies may be reluctant to invest overseas in case China changes its regulations again after seeing their impact, which could be \u201cenormous\u201d, Lion said.\nSpeaking of China\u2019s new thresholds for impurities, which are 1 percent for nonferrous metals and 0.5 percent for waste electric motors, wires and cables, Lion said \u201cit would be extremely difficult\u201d for any scrap coming into China to conform with the new requirements.\n\u201cAt the very best, there is going to be an enormous dislocation and disruption in the copper supply chain.\u201d\nReporting by Tom Daly; Additional reporting by Emily Chow in Kuala Lumpur; Editing by Philip McClellan\n "}

Spotify can buck tradition because, though it\u2019s not yet turning a profit, it is earning cash, and it is not planning on raising more revenue from investors. Spotify, as measured by either its subscription service or its ad-supported free version, is the most popular music streaming service, according to the New York Times . \nCommentators say it\u2019s a good time for Spotify to go public. The company has 60 million paying subscribers, just renegotiated long-term licensing deals with three major record labels, and is valued at about $15 billion. (It is, however, facing a copyright suit from Wixen Music Publishing, filed in late December 2017.) \nThe Wall Street Journal says that due to other companies\u2019 need for cash, \u201cit is far from guaranteed\u201d that more will follow Spotify\u2019s lead. However, according to Bloomberg , Spotify \u201ccould create a new model for growth companies in which they raise all their money in private markets and do all their trading in public ones, with some small variations.\u201d \nWhatever the case, Wall Street will be watching.

Half of Americans say they'll watch the big game. About a fifth say they won't watch because of the politics. Published 19 Mins Ago SHARES \nThe politicization of football this season may hurt Super Bowl LII viewership, according to two new surveys commissioned by CNBC. \nJust over half of U.S. adults plan to watch the big game this year, according to a survey conducted this week by Fluent , a data-driven marketing firm. Of the respondents who said they won't watch the game but did last year, a quarter said it's because football has gotten too political. Another 20 percent said they won't watch the Super Bowl because of President Donald Trump's past comments regarding the NFL. \nThat would mean millions of people could skip the game because of the politics . \nThis season, the NFL had a unique and unexpected opponent: the president of the United States. Trump took to Twitter dozens of times to criticize the NFL, players and even the commissioner. Trump's criticism of the league was sparked by former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick who led a leaguewide movement of players kneeling during the national anthem. Trump tweet 1 \nThe Fluent survey indicates that the president may not be alone in his sentiment. Of those surveyed, 44 percent of those who identified themselves as \"huge football fans\" agreed with Trump, saying they disapproved of NFL players protesting during the game. In contrast, nearly a third of respondents said they believed the football field is an appropriate place for political protests. \nAt the peak of the protests (during the NFL season's third week) more than 150 players protested, according to ESPN . Protests died down each week after that. \nWhether or not Trump is to blame for the NFL's troubles, the league has taken a hit this year. Viewership ratings are down significantly. Across the board, the NFL has seen a decline of 8.7 percent this year (though \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" is still the most-watched program on television) and the playoffs ratings have hit new lows as well. Trump tweet 2 \nRoughly the same number of Americans plan to watch the Super Bowl this year as last year, according to a separate survey this week by Reconnect Research . The company conducted a telephone survey of Americans and found that 44 percent said they watched last year's Super Bowl, and 43 percent said they plan to watch this year. Plus an extra 3 percent of people who weren't sure. \nOf note, many people think Trump's effect is bigger on other people than themselves . Reconnect Research's survey showed that 21 percent of Americans said they are watching less football this year because of Trump's comments against the league. But 27 percent of people think his comments made other people watch less football. \nIn total, 63 percent of people said they've been watching less football this year compared with the past few years, but a minority of those people blamed the anthem protests and Trump's comments. \nOne in 8 people, or about 12.5 percent, plan to watch the Super Bowl to see who will protest this year. Super Bowl LII takes place on Feb. 4, and will air on NBC. \nFluent conducted an online survey of 3,170 adults (ages 18 and up) living in the United States on Jan. 15, 2018. Respondents were randomly selected and data was weighted to the U.S. Census 2010 population distribution. The survey has a margin of error of 1.7. \nReconnect Research's poll results are based on a telephone survey completed by 648 people living in the United States on Jan. 17, 2018. Respondents were randomly selected and the survey has a margin of error of 3.9. \nDisclosure: NBC and CNBC are owned by Comcast's NBCUniversal unit."}

It touched a 2-1\/2-week low of 112.055 on Tuesday after declining steadily from a high above 113.750 scaled in December.\nThe euro was 0.05 percent lower at $1.2011 after losing roughly 0.4 percent overnight. The common currency had surged to a three-month high of $1.2081 on Tuesday.\nThe dollar bounced after Wednesday\u2019s strong U.S. manufacturing and construction data.\nIt gained further support as the minutes from the Fed\u2019s Dec. 12-13 meeting were seen as more hawkish than anticipated, indicating the central bank is still poised to raise interest rates several times this year.\nFed policymakers acknowledged the U.S. labour market\u2019s solid gains and the expansion in economic activity, even as they affirmed policymakers\u2019 worries about persistently low inflation.\nThat suggested the central bank will continue to pursue a gradual approach in raising rates but could pick up the pace if inflation accelerates.\n\u201cThe dollar did feel downward pressure at the turn of the year, but the selling was not based on very strong factors,\u201d said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.\nRebalancing of positions caused by investors closing their books towards the turn of each year can lead to dollar selling.\n\u201cAs such, strong U.S. data and the Fed\u2019s minutes, which suggested board members were not as pessimistic towards the potential economic impact of U.S. tax cuts as many in the market expected, helped the dollar get back on course,\u201d Yamamoto said.\nIncreasing investor risk appetite in broader markets also supported the dollar, notably against perceived safe-havens like the yen and Swiss franc, which was at 0.9776 franc per dollar after sliding 0.6 percent the previous day to pull back from a three-month peak of 0.9699.\nBuoyed by overnight gains on Wall Street, Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei began the first day of trading in 2018 by rallying more than 2 percent. Crude oil prices were at 2-1\/2-year highs, helping fuel inflation expectations.\nThe pound dipped 0.1 percent to $1.3510, following overnight losses of 0.6 percent, when it fell back from a 3-1\/2-month high of $1.3614 overnight against a rebounding dollar.\nThe Australian dollar slipped 0.2 percent to $0.7822 and the New Zealand dollar dipped 0.1 percent to $0.7085.\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies extended the previous day\u2019s bounce to stand 0.1 percent higher at 92.248.

Here's why.","text":"Shares of Hain Celestial dropped Friday on a report describing the company's sale prospects as grim due to its \"overload\" of brands.\nIndeed, Hain's many brands have complicated a sale process for quite some time. Some of the country's biggest food companies have already looked and passed. But this year, several factors \u2014 continued pressure on Big Food, Hain itself and even tax reform \u2014 may finally lead to a deal transpiring.\nFirst let's start with the challenges that have prevented a sale in the past.\nPrimarily, it has been, as the Thursday New York Post article acknowledges, that the company is a collection of seemingly haphazard brands and businesses: its protein business (Empire Kosher Poultry, Plainville Farms), its personal care business (Alba Botanica, Avalon Organics) and food (Terra Chips, Ella's Kitchen).\nThere has never been a clear buyer for all of these businesses, but there has been for select parts. The personal care business could make sense for Unilever . The protein business could work for Tyson or Pilgrim's Pride .\nThe snack business could be attractive for a number of food giants, if not for the fact that Hain's larger brands, like Celestial Seasonings, are swarmed by brands that have less than $75 million in revenue. It takes a lot of money for big food companies to turn small bits of revenue into large national brands. Companies have been largely adverse to making that gamble on Hain.\nMeantime, Hain's founder and CEO Irwin Simon, is the one that led the acquisitions and management of these small brands in its entirety. Without his knowledge and relationships, companies have been concerned it might be uniquely hard to pass the torch.\nHere's what's changed.\nFood companies are under more pressure than ever before .\nThe spree of 3G-style cost-cutting over the past few years has left little obvious fat left to trim. Food retailers are moving online, a channel that no longer offers yards of shelves to promote iconic products. Amazon and European grocers like Lidl are expanding their private-label presence in the U.S., appealing to millennials who care more about price than they do brand.\nCampbell Soup and Hershey recently announced their largest deals yet, buying Snyder's-Lance for $4.87 billion and Amplify Snack Brands for $1.6 billion, respectively.\nSnyder's-Lance, like Hain, had long been a potential takeover target, but many industry sources thought its direct store delivery model made a deal too complicated and expensive. Campbell's plans to buy the pretzel company therefore demonstrate the bets that companies are now willing to take.\nWith Snyder's and Amplify now off the table, the number of potential targets large enough to make an impact on the largest food brands has further whittled from what was already slim pickings.\nMeantime, the lowering of the corporate tax rate may help mitigate the complexity in breaking up Hain's various businesses. As the corporate tax rate drops from 35 percent to 21 percent, it may be cheaper for it to sell off a division than in times past.\nNot to mention, Hain has an activist. If Whole Foods is any lesson, an activist can make deals people thought would never happen become a reality .\nA settlement with activist investor Engaged Capital recently put its founder Glenn Welling on the Hain board. Engaged had disclosed at 9.9 percent stake the company over the summer.\nHain shares, which fell nearly 4 percent early Friday before recouping losses, were recently down less than 1 percent."}

Pakistan's new finance ministry chief Miftah Ismail speaks with a Reuters correspondent during an interview in Islamabad, Pakistan December 28, 2017. REUTERS\/Faisal Mahmood \nWashington plans to imminently slash \u201csecurity assistance\u201d to Pakistan, U.S. congressional aides told Reuters on Wednesday, although the type, scale and length of the cuts was unclear. A day earlier, the White House said it would suspend about $255 million in already delayed military assistance. \nTense ties between the uneasy allies nosedived on Jan. 1 when President Donald Trump lashed out on Twitter against Islamabad\u2019s \u201clies and deceit\u201d despite $33 billion in aid and the White House warned of \u201cspecific actions\u201d to pressurise Pakistan. \nA staunch U.S. Cold War ally and key player in the U.S.-backed invasion of Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Pakistan has watched warily as Washington has in recent years pivoted towards its arch-foe India. \nOver the past decade, U.S. threats to cut aid have been part and parcel of its frustrating relationship with Pakistan, a nation also seen as vital to the peace process in Afghanistan. \n\u201cAid cuts will not hurt us,\u201d Miftah Ismail, Pakistan\u2019s de facto finance minister, told Reuters. \n\u201cThat\u2019s not the leverage they have, because it is something they have reduced drastically over the years.\u201d \nPakistan received about $1 billion in U.S. assistance in 2016, down from a peak of about 3.5 billion in 2011, Pakistani and U.S. officials say. \nAbout $550 million of the 2016 total came from the Coalition Support Fund (CSF), a U.S. Defence Department programme to reimburse allies for the costs of supporting counter-terrorist and counter-insurgency operations. Pakistan was the largest recipient of such funds. \nThe remaining $450 million was a mix of military assistance and funds for international non-government bodies (NGOs) and other development programmes, Pakistan\u2019s finance ministry says. \nAnalysts say there are limits to how much the U.S. can fracture relations, since Pakistan cannot be isolated or completely sidelined, because of its proximity to, and influence in, Afghanistan. \n\u201cThere is really no way forward for the United States in Afghanistan without Pakistan playing some kind of cooperative and collaborative role,\u201d said Huma Yusuf, a Wilson Center Global Fellow.

REUTERS\/Joshua Roberts PART OF SOLUTION \nIslamabad worries that the United States, seeking to exert greater pressure on its ally, could in future train its crosshairs on Pakistan\u2019s fragile economy and impose some sort of financial sanctions. \nPakistani officials warn economic damage would weaken the country, proving counterproductive in Washington\u2019s battle against Islamist militant groups in South Asia. \n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how the U.S. financially or militarily hurts us and their own war effort doesn\u2019t get hurt,\u201d said Ismail, adding that it was impossible to find a solution to the Afghan conflict \u201cwithout Pakistan being part of it\u201d. \nLast year, U.S. officials said the options being discussed to push Pakistan to change its behaviour included targeted sanctions of officials with ties to militant groups waging an insurgency in Afghanistan. \nThe U.S. officials have also suggested the Pentagon may ramp up drone strikes, driving Pakistani media to speculate if such air attacks would be widened beyond areas bordering Afghanistan. \nIslamabad could \u201creview its cooperation if it is not appreciated\u201d, its United Nations representative, Maleeha Lodhi, told media this week, which many interpreted as a reference to the vital transport route ferrying supplies to U.S. troops in Afghanistan through Pakistan\u2019s territory. \nPakistan remains committed to friendly relations with the United States, its powerful army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa, told Capital TV on Wednesday, but warned Washington against \u201ccoercion\u201d, and vowed not to \u201ccompromise on our self-respect\u201d. \nPakistan supported the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s as a foil to Indian influence in Afghanistan, and analysts say its military and security services maintained ties long after the Taliban regime was toppled in 2001. \nToday the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network militants are effectively an arm of Pakistan\u2019s foreign policy, U.S. officials say. Pakistan staunchly denies using proxies. \nTies with the United States are likely to stay fraught as Pakistan\u2019s strategic calculus remains unchanged, said Raoof Hassan, executive director of the Islamabad-based Regional Peace Institute. \n\u201cAs long as Pakistan continues to consider the Afghan Taliban as a strategic asset, which it can use some time in the future to become more relevant and influential in Kabul, there is no meeting point,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThe positions are diametrically opposite.\u201d Additional reporting by Saad Sayeed in ISLAMABAD and Syed Raza Hassan in KARACHI; Writing by Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Clarence Fernandez"}

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)\n* LME zinc price at 10-year highs: tmsnrt.rs\/2D7SQ62\n* LME zinc stocks and spreads: tmsnrt.rs\/2CE7Qrl\n* China's zinc imports: tmsnrt.rs\/2CWEwNH\nBy Andy Home\nLONDON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Zinc has started the new year with a bang, hitting a fresh 10-year high of $3,380 per tonne in the first week of trading on the London Metal Exchange (LME).\nThe only historical reference point for zinc at such levels is the bull market of 2005-2007, when LME three-month metal topped out at $4,600.\nFew seem to be expecting a return to such extreme pricing but, with funds adding length in both London and Shanghai, there are still many betting that zinc\u2019s two-year bull charge isn\u2019t over just yet.\nThey evidently agree with Goldman Sachs, which has revised upwards its price forecasts to $3,300 on a three-month basis, $3,500 on a six-month basis and $2,800 on a 12-month basis.\nEven as a supply response starts to build after two years of rising prices, Goldman\u2019s view is that \u201cthe market is likely to get even tighter in the first half of (this) year.\u201d (\u201cZinc: tightness to persist through 1H2018\u201d, Dec. 18, 2017).\nEvents in the three weeks since the bank issued that forecast have served only to reinforce its core message.\nGraphic on LME zinc price:\ntmsnrt.rs\/2D7SQ62\nGraphic on LME zinc stocks and time-spreads:\ntmsnrt.rs\/2CE7Qrl\nLME SPREADS TIGHTER AGAIN LME time-spreads eased steadily over the last two months of 2017 to the point that the benchmark cash-to-three-months period CMZN0-3 was valued at $10 contango in the middle of December, compared with $91 backwardation in October.\nThis loosening spread structure looked anomalous given the daily declines in LME-registered stocks.\nEither it was signalling more metal was on its way to the LME warehouse network or it was no more than a temporary mismatch of short and long positioning across the front part of the curve.\nIt\u2019s the latter interpretation that now looks the most likely.\nAbsolutely zero fresh metal has arrived in the LME storage system and time-spreads have tightened up again.\nThat cash-to-three-month period, for example, closed last week valued at $26 backwardation.\nMore LME spread tightness looks almost inevitable.\nNot only is headline inventory still ticking lower on a near daily basis but Friday\u2019s LME stocks report showed 25,075 tonnes of net new cancellations as metal is prepared for physical load-out.\nAll the cancellation action took place at New Orleans, which shouldn\u2019t come as a shock since the U.S. port now holds all but 1,700 tonnes of the 180,325 tonnes left in the entire system.\nExcluding cancelled tonnage, LME \u201clive\u201d stocks are now just 139,250 tonnes.\nSure, that\u2019s still higher than last year\u2019s July low point of 69,850 tonnes, but with no arrivals since the middle of October, exchange stocks liquidity is fast becoming a focal point of zinc\u2019s narrative of supply deficit.\nGraphic on China\u2019s net imports of refined zinc:\ntmsnrt.rs\/2CWEwNH\nCHINESE ZINC IMPORTS BOOM One possible reason for so little metal being available for LME delivery, despite the reappearance of a premium for cash metal, is a sharp pick-up in Chinese imports.\nChina\u2019s pull on metal from the rest of the world was distinctly subdued in the first half of 2017, net imports actually falling by 40 percent year-on-year to 170,000 tonnes.\nIndeed, China\u2019s lack of import appetite was a significant wrinkle in zinc\u2019s bull story.\nThe trend turned in July, however, with imports of refined zinc accelerating sharply.\nNovember itself saw net imports hit 122,600 tonnes, the largest monthly tally ever, eclipsing the previous record of 120,000 tonnes dating from March 2009.\nThe November count was boosted by the import of 50,903 tonnes of zinc from Spain, making it the second largest supplier in the first 11 months of 2017 after Australia, a more traditional source for Chinese importers.\nChina imported less than 10,000 tonnes of zinc from Spain in both 2015 and 2016 and even if November\u2019s flood turns out to be a one-off, there is a sense of metal moving from off-exchange statistical shadows to plug supply-chain gaps.\nThe Shanghai zinc contract is backwardated beyond the first three trading months and registered stocks are also close to historical lows.\nThere was some rebuild over the last week but at 77,383 tonnes, inventory held in Shanghai Futures Exchange sheds is 82,000 tonnes lower than this time last year and 130,000 tonnes lower than in January 2015.\nChina is itself a major producer of zinc, both at the mined and the refined metal level.\nBut the country\u2019s ability to respond to physical tightness and higher prices has been severely constrained by the ongoing environmental campaign.\nWhile China\u2019s zinc mines \u201cused to be the swing producers in previous cycles\u201d, Goldman Sachs analysts argue that the country\u2019s zinc production in this particular price cycle \u201chas disappointed and is likely to only increase slowly going forward.\u201d\nTHE ONLY WAY IS UP? The steady attrition of LME stocks and the sharp pick-up in Chinese imports have reinvigorated the bull argument for higher zinc prices.\nBut, judging by the LME options market, the optimism comes with a sell-by date.\nCall options confer the right to buy and, not entirely surprisingly, there is open interest on strikes such as $4,000, $4,400 and $4,500 in each of the next five months.\nBeyond June, however, open interest almost totally disappears above the $3,800 strike, suggesting Goldman is not the only one looking for prices to peak around the middle of the year.\nThe only outlier on the 2018 call options heat map is the four lots (100 tonnes) of open interest on the $5,000 strike in December.\nIt\u2019s a relatively small bet but a big call that zinc\u2019s bull charge is going to be extended for longer and further than consensus.\nBullish exuberance?\nQuite possibly, but until the LME stocks trend turns, tightness in both physical and paper markets looks set to the defining feature of the zinc market over the coming weeks and months.\nEditing by David Evans\n "}

About half say equities have more room to run, and a similar amount expect bonds to decline in the current interest rate environment.\nBut RIAs surveyed recognize that everyone may not share their rosy outlook for 2018. They report that their clients are most concerned about retirement issues, followed by taxes and estate planning issues.\n\"Looking ahead to 2018, RIAs generally like what they see - for their clients and for themselves,\" said Vanessa Oligino, Director, Business Performance Solutions, TD Ameritrade Institutional. \"And when it comes to capitalizing on the current climate for their clients, independent advisors increasingly look to ETFs as their investment vehicle of choice.\"\nThree hundred RIAs overseeing $161 million in client assets, on average, participated in the latest annual sentiment survey, which was fielded between November 27 and December 7, 2017, during Congressional negotiations on tax legislation.\nRIAs Prefer ETFs\nWhen it comes to investing client assets, more than half of independent RIAs say they use ETFs more than mutual funds or individual stocks.\nA third say assets for new ETF investments will come from cash in 2018, and 27 percent say they will come from the sale of mutual funds. RIAs are less apt to sell stocks to fund new ETF purchases, however: just 9 percent say the sale of individual securities will fund new ETF investments.\nAlthough factors such as performance and total costs are important, advisors say the construction of the underlying index is the main reason they chose a particular ETF.\nThis year's survey also revealed that most RIAs do not buy or switch ETFs simply because new offerings have been introduced by a particular sponsor. Instead, advisors say their selections are guided by asset allocation strategies or lower costs.\nGrowing RIAs Expect Another Boost in 2018\nFor much of the past decade, the RIA industry has enjoyed growth amid the second-longest bull market since World War II. As they look ahead, advisors surveyed are forecasting more of the same in 2018. Seventy-eight percent expect their firm\u2019s assets under management to rise in 2018 and nearly half say assets will grow faster than they did in 2017.\nThese sunny projections come on the heels of a largely successful 2017. RIAs report that during the latter half of the year, revenues grew on average by 15 percent, while assets under management grew by 16 percent.\nSixty-five percent of RIAs gained new clients last year, for an average growth rate of 16 percent. Advisors say their biggest pipeline for new clients remains the full-service brokerage firms: investors leaving national full-service broker-dealers made up more than a third of their new clients in 2017.\nGrowth takes investment, and RIAs are committing resources to developing their firms. Last year, technology as well as legal and compliance matters dominated firm spending. RIAs predict they will make their biggest investments in marketing and hiring in 2018, in keeping with their top strategic priorities: marketing and enhancing the client experience.\nThese RIAs say that technology investments that will improve their client experience - such as digital documents and e-signature, and CRM tools - are on the table for 2018.\nCould anything trip up their momentum in 2018? Advisors say regulations are their biggest potential roadblock as well as a lack of consumer awareness about what makes independent RIAs different from other financial services providers.\nJust 1 percent of survey respondents are extremely concerned about the threat of robo-advisors on their business.\n\"RIAs naturally want to sustain their recent success, but they can\u2019t just sit back and expect tailwinds to propel their growth,\" said Oligino. \"Though the competitive landscape has never been more heated, we see many independent advisors doing what's needed to help their long-term future.\"\nCarefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. A prospectus, obtained by calling 866-766-4015, contains this and other important information about an investment company. Read carefully before investing.\nETFs can entail risks similar to direct stock ownership, including market, sector, or industry risks. Some ETFs may involve international risk, currency risk, commodity risk, leverage risk, credit risk and interest rate risk.

{"published":"2018-01-23T20:15:00.000+02:00","title":"At Davos, CEOs must address income inequality","text":"Global leaders of all backgrounds are gathering at the World Economic Forum in Davos that began on Tuesday. Without a doubt, the business community heads in with much greater optimism than they had at least year's convening.\nWhat a difference a year\u2014and a global economic revival\u2014can make to what CEOs have on their minds.\nIn late 2016, the dark cloud of a global recession ranked as the greatest fear of respondents to The Conference Board's annual survey of top business executives. One year later, not all CEOs have broken into a happy dance with three percent (or better) global economic growth predicted for 2018. But, the latest Conference Board C-Suite Challenge Survey shows that \"global recession\" dropped to 19th on their list of \"hot-button issues.\"\nDefensive tactics such as controlling baseline costs, managing currency risk, and raising capital reserves \u2013 challenges so prominent 12 months earlier \u2013 have taken a backseat to growth-oriented ones including talent, digitization, and innovation.\nMoreover, the results reveal a touch of greater social consciousness in the collective minds of business leaders. Admittedly, the CEO community alone may not be able to achieve the worthy theme and goal of this year's meeting, Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World . However, in light of that theme, the findings from three survey topics should encourage executives to lead the narrative and advance solutions at this global gathering.\n\"This year, CEOs expressed heightened concern over the potential impact of income inequality on social and business environments.\" First, growth is good, but the benefits need to be better spread around. This year, CEOs expressed heightened concern over the potential impact of income inequality on social and business environments. It has risen to seventh on our global list of hot-button issues, up from 18 th in 2017; it ranks even higher in China and the rest of emerging Asia. And chief human resource officers in our survey rank it as their fifth-highest hot-button issue.\nWhy does increasing concern about inequality make sense to business leaders? The potential impact of income inequality on employee engagement and morale may well have an impact on productivity. And wage increases may be needed not only to attract high-quality workers, but also to avoid a large consumer class with limited purchasing power.\nSecond, business leaders realize they must develop stronger and more value-driven cultures. In their eyes, achieving this requires building more engaged, productive, innovative, customer-centric and ultimately more productive, more profitable, and more socially aware organizations.\nInclusive and engaging cultures go a long way toward addressing 2018's top-voted CEO concern: the ability to attract and retain talent. The premium placed on talent comes as no surprise, since executives must navigate increasingly tight labor markets, exacerbated by a faster pace of digital transformation. In other words, what has often been seen as the \"soft stuff\" no longer seems so soft.\nThird, one of the most critical themes centers on communications. Business leaders are vowing to better and more effectively communicate within their organizations - up, down, and across. Being more open, transparent, and inclusive starts at the top, and is critical to building a culture where everyone can be heard, feel safe, and have their ideas count.\nWhen deliberating and applying their business acumen at this week's conference, business leaders might think of the Greek philosopher Plutarch as their guiding light. He once said that \"An imbalance between rich and poor is the oldest and most fatal ailment of all republics.\"\nWhile Plutarch was sounding the alarm about financial inequity, a sense of inequity also extends to the workplace and the environment. Judging from this year's theme, the WEF believes creating a shared future lies within reach.\nWhile it may not be in the sole purview of CEOs to re-unite an uncertain and fragmented world community, it is in their power to address the issues that divide their own workplaces. A commitment to inclusion, fairness, upskilling through training and development, and worker engagement would be a step in that direction.\nCommentary by Bart van Ark , executive vice president, chief economist, and chief strategy officer at The Conference Board and co-author, with Charles Mitchell , of C-Suite Challenge 2018 .

The disaster caused billions of dollars in economic damage and led former President Barack Obama's to increase regulation of the industry.\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke said on Thursday the department's draft National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2019 to 2024 would make over 90 percent of the outer continental shelfs total acreage available for leasing to drillers, a national record.\nThat would reverse the Obama administration order placing 94 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf off limits to drillers. Obama's 2017-2022 plan would be replaced by the new program when it is finalized.\n\"We want to grow our nations offshore energy industry, instead of slowly surrendering it to foreign shores,\" Zinke said in prepared remarks.\nHe said 25 of 26 planning areas on the Outer Continental Shelf will be considered for leasing, covering all U.S. coastlines. Proposed sales include 19 off the coast of Alaska, seven in the Pacific, 12 in the Gulf of Mexico and nine in the Atlantic Region. The last offshore lease sales for the East and West coasts were in the 1980s.\nAlaska's North Aleutian Basin\/Bristol Bay will be exempted after drilling was barred there by a previous executive order.\nZinke said the proposal was just the start of a dialogue with local stakeholders and the plan was not final. The draft will be subject to a 60-day comment period.\nThe proposal marks a huge shift from previous policy.\nWeeks before leaving office, Obama banned new oil and gas drilling in federal waters in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, protecting 115 million acres (46.5 million hectares) of waters off Alaska and 3.8 million acres (1.5 million hectares)in the Atlantic from New England to the Chesapeake Bay.\nTrump in April ordered the Interior Department to overhaul the leasing schedule to promote increased drilling. At the time, low oil prices and soaring onshore production were curtailing demand for offshore leases, raising questions about the benefits of the move. Oil prices have since risen to around three-year highs.\nIndustry groups welcomed Thursday's announcement.\n\"Expanding access to additional offshore reserves allows the United States to better understand where production potential exists and where capital should be invested,\" said Independent Petroleum Association of America senior vice president Dan Naatz.\nOCEANS TO OIL FIELDS\nBut lawmakers from both parties, environmental groups, governors and local business leaders said they were opposed to any effort to open coastlines to drilling rigs, citing environmental risks and threats to lucrative tourism industries.\nFlorida Republican Governor Rick Scott said he is aggressively fighting to plan. \"I have already asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration,\" he said.\nEnvironmental groups described the plan as dangerous. Trumps trying to turn our oceans into oilfields. His reckless plan would expose more wildlife and coastal communities to devastating oil spills, said Kristen Monsell, ocean program legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity.\nCoastal tourism business groups were girding for a long fight against the proposal, which comes as the Gulf Coast recovers from the Deepwater spill. The plan would open the California coast where drilling opposition has been fierce since a major oil spill in the 1960s soiled popular beaches.\nFrank Knapp, founder of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, accused the federal agency of favoring the oil and gas sector over the tourism sector.\n\"What part of the business sector are they listening to? Its certainly not small or coastal businesses, Knapp said.\nThe Defense Department has also raised concerns about opening drilling that had been banned off the eastern Gulf of Mexico, where military exercises are held.

About a week ago we said it had peaked, and now it looks like we have a couple more weeks. It should peak around February,\" Gottlieb told CNBC's \" Squawk Box \" from the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. \nThe flu is widespread in the U.S. right now. Healthy people have died from influenza this year, a reminder that the common virus can be a killer. One problem that causes the flu to spread is people with less-severe symptoms going out instead of staying home, Gottlieb said. Pressure to go to the office and work while sick is one way germs spread.\nThis year's flu vaccine hasn't been particularly effective because the strain chosen mutated during development in chicken eggs, Gottlieb said. Research published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in November supported that.\nScientists are exploring new ways to manufacture influenza vaccines, such as growing the virus in cells. However, the process is more expensive and has a lower yield than the traditional method of using chicken eggs, Gottlieb said. \n\"The holy grail is a universal vaccine that will elicit a T-cell response so good against any strain of influenza so we're out of this business of trying to guess what the predominant strain will be,\" he said. T-cells stimulate the immune response to foreign bodies.\nNow, the FDA meets every February to choose what to put into the year's flu shot based on recommendations from the World Health Organization. It includes three or four strains, since multiple viral strains can circulate throughout the season.\nScientists are trying different methods to create a universal vaccine. \nVaccitech, which spun out from the University of Oxford's Jenner Institute, is testing a universal vaccine in clinical trials. It goes after the bottom part of the protein on flu viruses to boost T-cell response, rather than the traditional antibody response. GV, the venture arm of Google parent Alphabet , is an investor.\nIt's unclear when a universal flu shot may enter the market, Gottlieb said. But he says it's going to be more expensive than what's on the market now."}

In 2018, conditions are right for a sequel.\nBack then, concerns about growth and tougher regulations spurred deals like Pfizer \u2019s $68 billion acquisition of Wyeth and Merck & Co.\u2019s $41 billion acquisition of Schering-Plough.\nToday, growth concerns are rising again, and several other factors, including consolidation in other parts of health care, are setting the stage for another wave of deals.\nDrugmakers have relied on price increases for a big portion of their recent growth, but those are getting harder to push through. True, pharmaceutical companies boosted list prices as usual when the calendar turned to the new year, but raising prices doesn\u2019t pack the same punch as it did in years past.\nNow, consolidation among insurers and pharmacy-benefit managers means drugmakers are seeing a smaller share of those hikes than in recent years, while money paid as rebates to PBMs increases. \u201cBiopharma companies now have a reduced ability to increase net, realized price in the U.S.\u201d compared to the status quo since 2010, analysts at Leerink Partners said in a note last month.\nBuying up smaller biotech startups has also helped boost growth rates for big pharma companies. But years of brisk acquisitions means that there is now a relative scarcity of targets with drugs that are close to generating revenue and have strong enough sales potential to move the needle for bigger outfits.\nConsider in 2016, Pfizer bought Medivation, which had a blockbuster cancer drug already on the market, for $14 billion . Gilead Sciences bought Kite Pharma for a similar price last summer, but Gilead doesn\u2019t expect that deal to contribute to earnings for several years.\nBalance sheets within this group are generally strong enough to absorb larger-scale transactions, while debt capital remains extremely cheap. And company executives finally have clarity on U.S. tax policy after a long period of uncertainty. There is no shortage of opportunities for partnering. More than 20 branded drug companies have projected 2018 revenues above $10 billion, according to FactSet.\nThe main obstacles to deals are regulatory approval and integration concerns, which are particularly important because the companies in question are so large\nFor big pharma, a new set of challenges could lead to a familiar solution.\nWrite to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com"}

Cricket - Ashes test match - Australia v England - SCG, Sydney, Australia, January 6, 2018. Australia's Mitchell Marsh misses the ball during the third day of the fifth Ashes cricket test match. REUTERS\/David Gray \nKhawaja shared a stand of 188 with captain Steve Smith, who was dismissed just before lunch, and another of 101 with Marsh, who just missed out on his second hundred of the series in the over before stumps. \nMarsh will resume on 98 on day four with his brother Mitchell, who was 63 not out, as they look to bat the tourists out of the match and set up an opportunity for their bowlers to secure a win that would give Australia a 4-0 series triumph. \nThe Marsh brothers combined for 104 in the final session and punished England with a flurry of boundaries in the last hour as the bowlers tired after a long day\u2019s slog in bright sunshine at the Sydney Cricket Ground. \nIt was Khawaja\u2019s sure hand, though, that guided Australia past England\u2019s tally of 346 after Mooen Ali (1-125) had stunned a packed house by moving the apparently unmoveable when he dismissed Smith caught and bowled for 83. \n\u201dIt\u2019s awesome,\u201c Khawaja said of his innings. \u201dThe SCG was where I grew up playing cricket for New South Wales and an Ashes century is something I have wanted for a long time and I haven\u2019t been able to achieve, so it was very satisfying. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to celebrate test centuries too much unless you\u2019re Steve Smith. You\u2019ve got to enjoy them when they come.\u201d \nSmith had already scored three centuries, two of them unbeaten and one a double, in the series and although denied a fourth, walked off his home ground having amassed 687 runs at an average of 137.4 over the five tests. \nKhawaja had an lbw scare in the following over but was reprieved when TV pictures showed Mason Crane had bowled a no ball and he otherwise looked assured as he calmly totted up the runs in the face of some tight English bowling. Cricket - Ashes test match - Australia v England - SCG, Sydney, Australia, January 6, 2018. England's captain Joe Root yells to the umpires after a decision was overturned for the wicket of Australia's Mitchell Marsh during the third day of the fifth Ashes cricket test match. REUTERS\/David Gray \nA fine stroke-player but considered suspect against spin bowling, Khawaja has had a stop-start career in the baggy green since making his debut at the SCG in the corresponding Ashes clash eight years ago. OVATION \nHe wasted no time in knocking off the nine runs he needed to secure his maiden hundred against England at the start of the day, cutting Moeen for two before soaking up the ovation from a crowd largely clad in pink in support of Glenn McGrath\u2019s cancer charity. Slideshow (8 Images) \nSpinner Moeen was again bowling when he reached the 150-run mark, two consecutive fours to get over the mark a rare flourish in a 381-ball innings that contained 18 of them along with a solitary six. \nEngland captain Joe Root came closest to a breakthrough in the second session when Shaun Marsh, on 22, was given out caught behind only for the decision to be reversed when TV pictures showed a big gap between ball and bat. \nIt was debutant leg-spinner Crane who finally ended the 31-year-old\u2019s time out in the middle to claim his first test victim, beating the bat to leave Khawaja stranded and Jonny Bairstow with a simple stumping. \nCrane, 20, attracted the ire of the crowd with his habit of pulling out of his run-up but kept his head up despite finishing with figures of 1-125. \nIt was a very good day on the decision review system for Australia with Mitchell Marsh also reversing a late lbw decision after the snicko revealed an inside edge. \n\u201cIt was pretty tough,\u201d said Bairstow. \u201cWe\u2019re 150 overs into the innings so there\u2019s going to be a few tired bodies but I thought the way the guys toiled out there and worked hard was really impressive.\u201d \nAustralia won back the Ashes with victories in the first three matches in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth with the fourth test in Melbourne finishing in a draw last week.
