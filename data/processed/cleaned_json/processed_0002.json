That topped the 9.7 percent annualized gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 including dividends. Berkshire does not pay a dividend. \nBarclays on Monday also raised its price target for Berkshire Class A shares to $357,000 from $322,500, three weeks after the shares reached $300,000 for the first time. It raised its target for Berkshire Class B shares to $238 from $215. \nBerkshire usually releases year-end results and Buffett\u2019s annual shareholder letter on the last Saturday in February. \nIn afternoon trading, Berkshire Class A shares were up $1,575 at $303,100, and Class B shares were up 64 cents at $202.06. Both share classes rose 22 percent in 2017. Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Phil Berlowitz"}

[and] aerospace assembly ... [than in] a bottle of shampoo or a package of diapers,\" he explained. \nCramer acknowledged that there are plenty of reasonable arguments against investing in consumer stocks. Some worry that their dividends won't offset the costs of rising interest rates. Others wonder what use they will be if the economy continues to strengthen. \nOthers still point to earnings reports like Kimberly-Clark's, in which the company talked about the benefits of an improving global economy, rising inflation and a weakening dollar, but still only delivered 1 percent growth. \n\"However, the fact remains that none of these stocks have lost their bond market equivalent status, and if you can find the ones with the right balance of capital allocation toward dividends and buybacks, you should be able to do pretty well long-term,\" Cramer said. \n\"If you need income, the consumer packaged goods stocks are a much better deal than bonds, at least for the moment,\" he added. \nBut while Cramer supported the long-term strategy of investing in consumer goods stocks, he couldn't pound the table on them for all investors for five reasons: Growth constraints from e-commerce vendors like Amazon Frugal millennial buyers seeking better deals in the likes of Walmart , Costco and the dollar stores The negative effects of declining U.S. birth rates , which affect few other businesses A rising interest rate environment's stifling effect on their yields Slower innovation than health care or technology companies \nOne might wonder why investors would choose consumer goods stocks given all of these potential headwinds, Cramer said. \n\"I think it's simple: if you're running a diversified portfolio, as everyone should be, and you're looking for a sustainable, long-term source of income, then these stocks are absolutely worth looking at,\" he argued. \"Worst case, they go lower [and] give you higher yields.\" \nThe \"Mad Money\" host invoked Procter & Gamble's turnaround plan: understanding the rise of new shopping outlets with competitive pricing and direct-to-consumer channels, the company has recognized the need to grow its cash flow and continue rewarding shareholders. \nWith the addition of activist investor Nelson Peltz to its board, Procter & Gamble could undergo a huge margin improvement, get a better grip on its cost structure and re-introduce its products to a new group of consumers, Cramer said. \n\"In other words, know thyself,\" the \"Mad Money\" host concluded. \"Are you older and saving up for retirement? Then you want steady dividend increases, exactly like you'll probably get from both Procter and Kimberly. But if you simply want stocks that are going up, FANG-like, then forget about this group, at least for now.\" WATCH: Cramer's selective bull case for consumer goods stocks show chapters"}

Hodgson said under such circumstances VAR\u2019s flaws could be exposed. \n\u201cHow many times are you going to need to see the incident before you can have an opinion?\u201d he asked. \n\u201cWe can\u2019t come to a conclusion because one person will say \u2018Definitely yes,\u2019 one will say \u2018Definitely no\u2019.

Macron is on the second leg of a three-day state visit in China. \nThe Alibaba spokeswoman said there were no further details available on what any Hong Kong listing plan could involve. \nAlibaba held its record $25 billion public float in New York in 2014 after Hong Kong, its favored venue, refused to accept its governance structure where a self-selecting group of senior managers control the majority of board appointments. \nHong Kong is now set to allow dual-class shares under rule changes to be proposed by the city\u2019s stock exchange as it raises the stakes in its battle against New York for blockbuster Chinese initial public offerings. \nSuch shares grant differentiated voting rights and underpin the alternative governance and shareholding structures favored by many owners of new age industries such as technology. \nOver $3 billion worth of Alibaba shares were traded on Monday, based on Reuters calculations using NASDAQ data. The stock closed at $190.33, with 16.23 million shares traded. \nThat compares with the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd\u2019s (HKEX) ( 0388.HK ) average daily securities turnover of HK$88.2 billion ($11.28 billion) in 2017. FILE PHOTO: A sign of Alibaba Group is seen during the fourth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, December 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo \n\u201cNEW ECONOMY\u201d PLATFORM \nShares in HKEX, the city\u2019s exchange operator, rose as much as 3.1 percent to HK$270 on Tuesday, their highest level since July 2015. \nAnalysts said that an Alibaba listing in Hong Kong could help drive more funds from the mainland towards the city and could convince other big firms, in particular technology-related ones, to list in the financial hub. \n\u201cIf the trading volume in Hong Kong is even better than that in the U.S., it will send out a signal to other new economy new listings that Hong Kong is a much better place for a listing than the U.S,\u201d said Steven Leung, sales director at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong. \nFor Alibaba, it could provide greater access to investors closer to China who are familiar with its business and allow it to benefit from the Hong Kong government\u2019s growing support for financial services innovation, said James Lloyd, Asia-Pacific FinTech leader at consulting firm EY. \nThe HKEX said in December that it had begun drafting specific rule changes for allowing dual-class shares that will be put up for a formal public consultation in the first three months of 2018. \nUnder the planned rule changes, \u201cinnovative\u201d Chinese companies with a market capitalization over HK$10 billion and a primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq or the London Stock Exchange would be able to seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong. The HKEX has not yet defined what \u201cinnovative\u201d is. \n\u201cWe are also creating a new route to secondary listings in Hong Kong to attract companies from emerging and innovative sectors. We are aware that many successful new economy companies already listed in the US and UK would benefit from these reforms,\u201d wrote Charles Li, chief executive of HKEX, in a blog post last month when the proposed changes were put forward. \nJust 3 per cent of Hong Kong listings in the past decade, by market value, have been so-called \u201cnew economy\u201d companies, compared with 47 per cent for the New York Stock Exchange, according to a discussion paper published by the HKEX in June. \nSome analysts said technical issues and underlying concerns about the dual-class structure still needed to be resolved and fine tuned. \n\u201cThe main concern is about the protection to minority investors under the dual structure,\u201d said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities.

FILE PHOTO - Turkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, accompanied by his deputies Bulent Arinc (not pictured) and Bekir Bozdag (R), speaks during a news conference at Ataturk International Airport in Istanbul in this June 3, 2013REUTERS\/Stringer\/Files \nWednesday\u2019s court decision capped a trial that had strained diplomatic relations between the two countries and is likely to further aggravate tension between the NATO allies. \nThe case has angered Erdogan and his ministers, some of whom accuse U.S. court officials of ties to a cleric blamed for a 2016 coup attempt. Some of the testimony at the trial implicated senior officials, including Erdogan. Ankara has said the case was based on fabricated evidence. \nMehmet Hakan Atilla, an executive at Turkey\u2019s majority state-owned Halkbank, was convicted on five of six counts in a Manhattan federal court, including bank fraud and conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions law. \n\u201cThe U.S. court, in a process carried out by relying on so-called \u2018evidence\u2019, which is fake and open to political exploitation, ... made an unprecedented interference in Turkey\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry said. \nU.S. prosecutors have charged a total of nine people in the case, including a former economy minister, Zafer Caglayan. However, only Atilla and a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader, Reza Zarrab, are in U.S. custody. \nErdogan, who has yet to comment on the decision, has previously dismissed the trial as a politically motivated attack on his government, and has attempted to use it to tap into anti-American sentiment among his supporters. \nAnkara has not, however, threatened to take concrete measures. \n\u201cPOLITICAL PLOT\u201d \nThe U.S. case against Atilla was based on the testimony of the gold trader Zarrab, who cooperated with U.S. prosecutors and pleaded guilty to charges of leading a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran. \nIn his testimony Zarrab implicated top Turkish politicians, including Erdogan. Zarrab said Erdogan, who has governed Turkey for nearly 15 years, personally authorised two Turkish banks to join the scheme when he was prime minister. \n\u201cThe Zarrab court case is a political plot\u201d, Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag tweeted on Thursday. \nHalkbank said Atilla had the right to appeal against the decision and said it had not been a party to the U.S. case. It noted there had been no financial or administrative decision taken against it by the court. \nThe bank has denied any wrongdoing and said its transactions were in line with local and international regulations. Halkbank shares were flat by late afternoon, giving up gains after advancing more than 4 percent. \nThe court decision is unlikely to damage Erdogan or his government at home, said Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence, a London-based consultancy. \n\u201cDomestically, I don\u2019t believe it will make any difference at all... The government has managed to cast a huge shadow on it by portraying it as a plot against Turkey and the government,\u201d Piccoli said. \u201cI think it is much more important in terms of the bilateral relations with the United States. This is a relationship that has been difficult for some time.\u201d \nLess clear was the potential fall-out for the banking sector, with some analysts seeing the possibility that one or more Turkish lenders could be hit by fines over the case. \n\u201cThe whole thing is really about what the consequences will be for the relationship between Turkey and the U.S.,\u201d said Paul Fage of TD Securities in London. \n\u201cObviously, the U.S. will impose fines, and the question will be how Turkey is going to respond to that, and whether this is going to escalate into some tit-for-tat thing.\u201d \nTurkey has said it will take any necessary measures to protect its banks from the potential impact of the case. \u201cIf anything is going to happen, in this situation we will stand by the banks,\u201d Finance Minister Naci Agbal told Reuters last month. \n\u201cWe must not allow any eventuality that would weaken our banking system.\u201d Additional reporting by Ali Kucukgocmen in Istanbul and Karin Strohecker in London; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Nick Tattersall and Janet Lawrence"}

Two other people confirmed details of the conversation between McGahn and Sessions.\nAll three people spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press to avoid publicly discussing an ongoing investigation.\nThe episode is known to special counsel Robert Mueller and his team of prosecutors and is likely of interest to them as they look into whether Trump's actions as president, including the May firing of FBI Director James Comey, amount to improper efforts to obstruct the Russia investigation.

That represents a year-over-year increase of 112% to 113% and a sequential quarter increase of 146% to 147%.\nFor the full year ENSERVCO expects to report revenue in the range of $40.7 to $40.8 million, up approximately 65% over revenue of $24.6 million in 2016.\nIn addition, the Company expects year-over-year improvements in net income and adjusted EBITDA, as it does not anticipate the higher revenue will be accompanied by a corresponding increase in fixed costs.

Our fleet utilization increased substantially during the fourth quarter and we expect to maintain a high utilization rate in the first quarter of 2018.

Franciscus added, \u201cI am pleased for the Company on its strong performance and that Dustin will be named CFO.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m excited and honored to be named CFO of ENSERVCO and look forward to pursuing what we believe are some very compelling growth opportunities,\u201d said Bradford. \u201cWe are focused on reducing the seasonality of our business, strengthening our sales and marketing initiatives, and increasing utilization of our expanded fleet.

The flu epidemic has already caused massive spikes in hospitalizations and deaths in states ranging from California to New York. And while the ideal time to get a flu shot is in the fall, you can still get the flu vaccine, often times for free, at retail clinics like CVS , Walgreens, Rite Aid , and Costco . \nSubscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily , our newsletter about the most exciting health innovations. Flu shot costs \nMany employer-sponsored health care plans offer free flu shot coverage at clinics. If you haven\u2019t already, you can ask your human resources department if your company offers such benefits. \nYour insurance may cover the cost of getting a flu shot at convenient retail locations like CVS, Walgreens, Costco, Rite Aid, and others. These locations are usually far less expensive than getting a flu shot at the doctor\u2019s office, especially if you don\u2019t have health insurance. \nFor instance, your out-of-pocket costs for a flu shot at CVS would be about $40 (and about $67 for the stronger version recommended for the elderly). On the cheaper side, Costco offers a $20 regular \u201cquadrivalent\u201d version and a $44 variety for older people, making it the cheapest out-of-pocket option in some markets, according to Cheapism . Rite Aid, Kroger , Walgreens, Wal-Mart , and others tend to offer flu shots for between $35 and $70 without health insurance, depending on the type of vaccine. Why you should still get a flu shot this season \nFlu season can last through May , and H3N2\u2014the viral strain that\u2019s propped up most often during the ongoing flu outbreak\u2014is a particularly nasty one, according to public health experts. It\u2019s especially deadly for the elderly, which is why officials are still urging older Americans in particular to get their flu vaccines. People over the age of 65 are recommended a higher-dose flu shot , such as Fluzone High-Dose and FLUAD. \nDespite concerns that this year\u2019s flu vaccine may only be 30% to 40% effective (the general range is usually between 40% and 60% since it\u2019s difficult to gauge which viral strain will be dominant in a given year), officials still recommend flu shots for everyone who doesn\u2019t have a specific allergy to the vaccine. Even people with egg allergies may be able to get a traditional flu shot , according to a large new study released last year. \nAnother caveat: It is still possible to contract the flu after getting a flu shot since the vaccine you receive may not protect against all strains. A \u201cquadrivalent\u201d flu shot is built for more strains than a \u201ctrivalent\u201d one. But even though there could be other versions floating around, public health experts agree that some protection is better than none. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

C hecking the value of cryptocurrencies constantly is unproductive, Kets said.\n\"You can't do anything about the price movement itself,\" she said.\nInstead she recommends people decide on a price point at which they'll sell \u2014 say, if the asset drops below $10,000 \u2014 and set their phone to alert them at that threshold.\nAndrey Rudakov | Bloomberg | Getty Images An attendee wearing a t-shirt decorated with a bitcoin rocket illustration and the words 'To the Moon' checks his smartphone at the CrytoSpace conference in Moscow, Russia, on Friday, Dec. 8, 2017. Jack Tatar, co-author of \"Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond,\" pointed to another reason why constant phone checks are futile.\n\"It's very hard to realize the gains you see on your phone,\" Tatar said. \"These markets are not as liquid as the stocks and bond market. You can check your phone and see you're up to $30,000, but if you wan't to realize that gain, you probably won't be able to do that.\"\nThat's because it can take days for a cryptocurrency transaction to complete, during which the value can change substantially.

Many people who've been seduced by bitcoin are individuals who might not fully understand what they're buying, he said.\n\"When you have something as volatile as bitcoin, it doesn't lend itself to long-term strategic thinking,\" Ayton said.\nDiversify beyond bitcoin Michael Sonnenshein, investments director at cryptocurrency firm Grayscale, said people might be less anxious if they're not banking on just one cryptocurrency.\nFortunately, you don't have to: There are currently some 2,000 cryptocurrencies to chose from. And more investment firms are looking into establishing index funds for cryptocurrencies. For example, Grayscale is soon launching a \"basket of digital currencies,\" in which investors' money will be spread across five digital currencies.\nDiversifying is useful for another reason, Edelman said: \"It's so early, we don't know which cryptocurrencies will survive.\"\nInvest only what you can afford to lose Tatar said people must restrict how much of their investments go to cryptocurrencies.\n\"You're seeing too many people jumping in and betting the ranch, and just saying 'yee-haw!'\" he said. \"They're not disciplined enough to realize they have to stay within their asset allocation models.\"\n\"Re-balancing\" your investments is essential with cryptocurrencies, he said, because of their tendency to rapidly change value.\n\"If you've invested 20 percent of your portfolio into bitcoin, and all of a sudden you check and, lo and behold, your bitcoins have increased so much that they're now 35 percent of your portfolio, you can rebalance and go back to your asset allocation,\" Tatar said. \"That should protect you from some of that volatility.\"\n\"You're seeing too many people jumping in and betting the ranch, and just saying Yee-Haw!\" -Jack Tatar , co-author, Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond It's not just the owners of cryptocurrencies who are stressed, Smigiel said.

As a child King could see fine during the day, but could not see anything at night. Soon that progressed to only being able to read with a bright light, then with a magnification system. He used a closed circuit TV magnification system to finish his degree.\nBy the time he went to work at IBM as an electrical engineer in 1989, he had lost all his vision. King started volunteering with IBM's accessibility projects, working on a screen reader to help visually impaired people \"see\" what is on their screens either through audio cues or a braille device. IBM eventually developed the first screen reader for a graphical interface which worked with its operating system OS\/2.\nOne of the lead researchers noticed King was passionate about the project, so he asked him to switch to the accessibility team full time in 1998. He eventually caught the eye of Facebook, who hired him from IBM in 2015.\n\"What I was doing was complaining too much,\" King said. \"I just wanted things to be better.\"\nKing is used to making the world adapt to him. The avid cyclist competed in the Atlanta, Sydney, and Athens Paralympic games, and plays the piano. On the request of his wife and two children, his family remained in Bend, Oregon after Facebook hired him. To get to Facebook's Menlo Park office, King hitches a ride with friend with a pilot's license who works at Google.\nMatt King at the 1996 Paralympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Automated alt-text King's IBM work revolved around creating the Accessible Rich Internet Applications standards, what he called \"the plumbing for accessibility on the Web.\"\nNow he works on features to help people with disabilities use Facebook, like adding captions on videos or coming up with ways to navigate the site using only audio cues.\n\"Anybody who has any kind of disability can benefit from Facebook,\" King said. \"They can develop beneficial connections and understand their disability doesn't have to define them, to limit them.\"\nOne of his main projects is \"automated alt-text,\" which describes audibly what is in Facebook images.\nWhen automated alt-text was launched in April 2016 , it only available for five languages on the iOS app, and was only able to describe 100 basic concepts like whether something was indoors or outdoors, what nouns were in the picture, and some basic adjectives like smiling.\nToday it is available in over 29 languages on Facebook on the web, iOS and Android. It also has a couple hundred concepts in its repertoire, including over a dozen more complex activities like sitting, standing, walking, playing a musical instrument or dancing.\n\"The things people post most frequently kind of has a limited vocabulary associated with it,\" King said. \"It makes it possible for us to have one of those situations where if you can tackle 20 percent of the solution, it tackles 80 percent of the problem. It's getting that last 20 percent which is a lot of work, but we're getting there.\"\nUsing artificial intelligence to see Though automatic alt-text is configured for blind and low vision users, solving for image recognition issues with artificial intelligence can benefit everyone.\nIn December 2017, Facebook pushed an automatic alt-text update that used facial recognition to help visually impaired people find out who is in photos . That technology can also help all users find photos of themselves they were not tagged in, and identify fraudsters who use a person's photo as their profile picture without permission.\nAllowing technology to \"see\" images may also help identify if content is safe for all users or if it's okay to advertise on. Content adjacency \u2014 or the images and videos that ads appear next to \u2014 has become a big issue for advertisers after reports showed ads running next to inappropriate content on YouTube .\nThe issue arises because it's not easy for computer programs to understand context, said Integral Ad Science (IAS) chief product officer David Hahn. Software has a hard time telling if an image of a swastika is on a Wikipedia page about the topic, part of a story on Nazism or on a flag being marched around in a protest, he said. It gets even more complicated when advertisers and their needs are involved: they amy want to advertise against a movie trailer that contains violence but not next to real-world violence from a protest.\nMost image recognition tech relies on terms called metadata, which are tagged to the image called, metadata and other clues like text or audio on the page, Hahn said. Video is typically analyzed by taking a random sample of still images from the clip and examining them to determine if it's the video is okay overall.\n\"There are varying degrees of accuracy and sophistication,\" Hahn said. It takes a lot of different treatments on images or text. There's not one source or one perspective that should be taken as gospel.\"\nFacebook's automated alt-text still relies on a staff of people telling the technology what certain images are, Facebook's King explained. But the machine's algorithms and recall rate \u2014 the frequency with which images are positively identified \u2014 is improving. And as it begins to understand more about context, it's getting closer to a day where it will need little to no human help."}

Students were surveyed about their driving habits, perceptions about risky driving behaviors (such as driving while drunk or using a phone), and strategies to improve traffic safety around drowsy driving in particular.\nOverall, participants considered themselves safe drivers, especially with passengers in the car.\nAt the same time, they viewed drowsy driving as less risky from a legal perspective than drunk driving or driving while under the influence of drugs or medications. Many participants acknowledged the crash risks associated with drowsy driving but felt relatively immune to legal risks and were unaware of laws against drowsy driving. They also questioned the enforceability of these laws. Without a biochemical test (such as one used for drunk driving, for example), they felt it would be difficult to validate drowsiness.\n\u201cYou can do a test and say . . . they were drunk, or when you\u2019re texting and driving . . . you can see that they just sent this last text message at this time,\u201d one student said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re drowsy . . . it\u2019s kinda hard to tell.\u201d\nMost students had experienced drowsy driving incidents, including crashes or near-misses, most often while driving alone and in the early morning or late at night. They described times they woke themselves up by opening the window to get fresh air, playing the radio loudly, chewing gum and talking along with the radio.\nTo improve messaging about drowsy driving, the students said depicting graphic consequences would be effective for young drivers, similar to campaigns against drunk driving. They said particularly gruesome, emotional and realistic depictions of crashes would get their attention and motivate them to change their behaviors. In addition, clever billboards or rotating LED signs that tell drivers to avoid drowsiness at night could be effective.\n\u201cIn Maryland, signs have promoted the nearest rest stop with a free cup of coffee after certain hours at night,\u201d Beck said in a phone interview. \u201cIt may be time to evaluate these and promote them in light of the growing awareness of this problem.\u201d\n\u201cNo one approach will be as effective as many approaches together,\u201d Beck said. \u201cWe need to ramp up both publicity and enforcement, and we need to establish a culture for young drivers that drowsy driving is the equivalent of drunk driving.\u201d\n\u201cThink of the three \u2018D\u2019s\u2019 - drunk, drowsy and distracted driving - that are the big causes of auto fatalities in the U.S., and they\u2019re all largely preventable,\u201d he said.\nIn 2007, a Massachusetts driver-licensing program imposed strict penalties for violating a law that prohibited unsupervised driving at night, which included a drowsy driving education program. A 2015 study of the program, published in Health Affairs ( bit.ly\/2Fn2faJ ), found that crash rates fell 19 percent for drivers ages 16-17 and 7 percent for ages 18-19.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found that legislation targeting the hazards of drowsy driving can reduce the risk of drowsy driving crashes among teen drivers,\u201d said Dr. Charles Czeisler of Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who worked on the 2015 study.\n\u201cThe most important message is that drowsy driving is dangerous,\u201d he told Reuters Health by email. \u201cYoung drivers are at the greatest risk of drowsy driving crashes.\u201d\nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2FpOJDd Sleep Health, online December 1, 2017.\n "}

But Liam, who is homeless, is still smiling as he tries to get people to stop and talk to him. \nAside from his winning smile, he also offers intrigue - what is that strange box hanging from his neck? \n\u201cI say to people: Hi, like to come and talk about this box? The box makes people stop,\u201d said Liam, 34, who is currently sleeping in a night shelter. \nPeople can tap their credit or debit cards on his box to give a three pounds (about $4) donation via contactless payment. \nTwo pounds goes towards Liam\u2019s wages; the other pound is donated to two homeless charities. In return, donors get a small art card depicting one of the week\u2019s news events. \nTapping into the increasing use of contactless payments for everything from commuting to rounds of drinks, social enterprise TAP London is offering work for the homeless as charity fundraisers, all without any cash changing hands. \nHomelessness is on the rise in England, with at least 4,100 people sleeping rough on any given night in 2016, according to the homeless charity Crisis. \nAt the same time, use of contactless payments more than doubled last year, according to trade group The UK Card Association. \nAll of TAP London\u2019s vendors are homeless and telling their personal stories often persuades people to donate. \nSince being kicked out of his family home at the age of 16, Liam has spent the last 18 years on and off the streets, struggling with cocaine and alcohol addiction. Following rehab, he\u2019s been clean for 13 months. \n\u201cI\u2018m trying to do something different rather than sit there and moan that the government won\u2019t do anything to help me,\u201d said Liam, who declined to give his full name. TO GIVE OR NOT? \nThe idea for the social enterprise came after TAP co-founder Polly Gilbert tried to donate food to a homeless man one evening. He rejected the hot dog she offered, explaining he had already been given five that evening. \n\u201cBoth of us had cared about homelessness but were frustrated at not knowing what to do,\u201d fellow co-founder Katie Whitlock, 28, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \nNewspaper reports about street beggars making lucrative gains by pretending to be homeless and concerns about donated money supporting addictions have left people confused about whether to give money, said Whitlock. \nGilbert and Whitlock quit their advertising jobs and spent a year researching contactless payment options and homelessness, meeting charities and local government councils before launching TAP London in November. \nThey work with the homeless charity St Mungo\u2019s to find their vendors but have also found them through other means - Liam had used classified ad website Craigslist to advertise that he was fit, healthy and ready to work. \n\u201cMore employment opportunities are needed. Homeless individuals are rarely given a chance to be part of their solution,\u201d said Whitlock. \nFor TAP vendor Viktor, 37, there is a big difference between asking for money from the public in this way and begging. \n\u201cWhen you are begging on the pavement you feel crap. The police are after you. You don\u2019t enjoy any minute of begging. It\u2019s very shameful,\u201d he said. \nNow being paid 9.75 pounds an hour, the \u2018living wage\u2019 in London, he is able to stay in a night shelter that only takes residents who are working. \nOn a good day, five people per hour stop and donate - but vendors are paid their hourly wage regardless of how many donors they attract. \nDo people ask why he is homeless? \n\u201cYes, and I really welcome that. It\u2019s better when the conversation is interactive,\u201d said Viktor, who wanted to be identified only by his first name. \nHe became homeless after losing his job due to crack addiction. Whilst unconscious on the street, a bag containing a bank card and his passport was stolen. \n\u201cWhat employment does is create a footprint again. They\u2019re thrilled to be paying taxes,\u201d said Whitlock. \u201cThey have contracts and a place to be each day.\u201d \nPotential donors are drawn in by the box. \n\u201cAs soon as I saw the thing I was interested as to what was round his neck. The box made me stop. And he had a smiley face,\u201d said Samantha Maclean, 27, who had stopped to tap for Liam. \n\u201cThe amount of times you walk past and wish you had cash to give but genuinely don\u2019t have any. Three pounds is nothing really. It\u2019s less than a coffee from Starbucks,\u201d she said.

Two decades earlier, 7 percent of white patients got kidneys from live donors, which was roughly twice the proportion among black people. \nOver the 20-year study period, the proportion of black patients getting live kidneys fell from 3.4 percent to 2.9 percent. \nDuring the same period, the proportion of Hispanic patients getting kidneys from live donors also declined, from 6.8 percent to 5.9 percent. Among Asian kidney recipients, however, live donation became more common, rising from 5.1 percent to 5.6 percent of patients. \n\u201cWe know that live-donor kidney transplants that involve patients receiving a kidney from a living relative, friend or other altruistic person are associated with longer life expectancy and higher quality of life as compared with deceased donor kidney transplants or long-term dialysis treatment,\u201d said lead study author Tanjala Purnell, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. \nWhile U.S. patients from racial and ethnic minority groups have long been less likely than white people to receive kidneys from live donors, the widening gap found in the study was a shock, Purnell said by email. \nWhile the study didn\u2019t examine why this disparity persists, it\u2019s possible some of the problem may be explained by racial and ethnic minorities having less access to private health insurance, primary care providers and kidney specialists as well as language barriers or cultural or religious concerns about donation, Purnell said. \n\u201cIt is important for patients to have early conversations about the benefits and risks of live-donor kidney transplantation with their doctors and family members,\u201d Purnell added. \u201cThese conversations may be important for alleviating concerns about transplantation and donation.\u201d \nShifts in organ donation policies and patient outreach in recent years have helped to increase the proportion of minority patients receiving kidneys from deceased donors, but haven\u2019t had the same impact on live donation. \nFor the study, researchers examined data on 453,162 adults awaiting kidney transplants from 1995 to 2014. \nPatients were typically around 51 years old and most were male. Almost half of them were white, although 30 percent were black, 16 percent were Hispanic and 6 percent were Asian. \nOverall, 39,509 patients received live-donor kidney transplants within two years of joining the wait list, the study found. \nCompared to white patients, black patients were 73 percent less likely to receive live kidney donations by the end of the study, while Hispanic patients had 48 percent lower odds and Asian patients had 58 percent lower odds. \nAt the beginning of the study period, black patients had been 55 percent less likely than white patients to receive a live-donor organ, Hispanic patients had been 17 percent less likely and Asian patients 46 percent less likely. \nThe study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how race and ethnicity might influence the chances of receiving a kidney transplant from a live donor, or why disparities have increased over time. Researchers also couldn\u2019t account for factors like income that might influence these odds. \nAt least some of the disparities revealed in the study may represent differences in how easily donors can afford to help, said Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, co-author of an accompanying editorial and a researcher at the University of Texas Health San Antonio. Patients with higher income, paid time off from work and more comprehensive medical benefits might have an easier time being live donors. \n\u201cLiving donation rates among Black and Hispanic patients seem to be limited by clustering of medical risk factors such as obesity and diabetes which are linked to kidney disease, reduced access and education regarding transplant options among Black and Hispanic patients, and financial disincentives faced by donors related to lost wages and fear of losing employment secondary to time needed for recovery,\u201d Cigarroa said by email. \n\u201cAdditionally, as we set forth in our editorial, evidence has been provided that these factors are related to the socioeconomic status of the patient and donor as much or more than they are genetic differences related to race and ethnicity,\u201d Cigarroa added. \nSOURCES: bit.ly\/2lWWDvJ and bit.ly\/2qoOGUD JAMA, online January 2, 2018."}

It also showed how the body seeks to defend against the damage alcohol can do. \n\u201cSome cancers develop due to DNA damage in stem cells. While some damage occurs by chance, our findings suggest that drinking alcohol can increase the risk of this damage,\u201d said Ketan Patel, a professor at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, who co-led the study. \nThe World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen, citing \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d it causes cancer in humans. \nA study published in 2011 found that alcohol is responsible for around 4 percent of all cancer in Britain - equating to around 12,800 cases a year. Professor Ketan Patel works in the lab at MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, Britain January 2, 2018. Picture taken January 2, 2018. REUTERS\/Chris Radburn \nIn Wednesday\u2019s study, published in the journal Nature, Patel\u2019s team gave diluted alcohol to mice and then analyzed the effect on the animals\u2019 DNA. They found that acetaldehyde can break and damage DNA within blood stem cells, permanently altering the DNA sequences within these cells. \nThis is important, Patel said, because when healthy stem cells become faulty, they can give rise to cancerous cells. Slideshow (7 Images) \nThe researchers also looked at how the body tries to protect itself against damage caused by alcohol. The first line of defense is a group of enzymes called aldehyde dehydrogenases or ALDHs, Patel explained. These break down the acetaldehyde into acetate, which cells can then use as a source of energy. \nIn the study, when mice lacking a critical ALDH enzyme were given alcohol, their DNA suffered four times as damage compared with mice with a properly functioning version of the enzyme. \nPatel said cells also have a second line of defense in the form of a range of DNA repair systems which, most of the time, allow them to fix and reverse different types of DNA damage. \nBut in some instances and in some people - particularly people from South East Asia - the repair systems fail to work, meaning their cells are unable to repair effectively. \n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that alcohol clearance and DNA repair systems are not perfect, and alcohol can still cause cancer in different ways - even in people whose defense mechanisms are intact,\u201d Patel said.

To accelerate the process, many are investing directly in the new services - and gaining access to intellectual property - via their own corporate venture capital (CVC) funds.\nBMW ( BMWG.DE ) has purchased stakes in a plethora of ride-sharing, smart-charging and autonomous vehicle software firms through its 500 million euro ($600 million) iVentures fund, the biggest such in-house facility belonging to a carmaker.\nAmong others that have been increasingly active are General Motors\u2019 ( GM.N ) GM Ventures, with $240 million, and Peugeot-maker PSA Group\u2019s ( PEUP.PA ) 100 million-euro investment arm.\nCVC funds, a familiar feature of innovative sectors such as tech and pharmaceuticals, have become more commonplace among carmakers since the 2008-9 financial crisis. They let companies skip some of the formalities otherwise required for new investments, and pounce more swiftly on promising startups.\nThe Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi venture will also obviate the current need to thrash out the ownership split for each new alliance acquisition.\nIt represents a further step in the integration of the carmakers as they pursue 10 billion euros in annual synergies by 2022. France\u2019s Renault holds a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, which in turn controls Mitsubishi. Ghosn heads Renault and chairs all three.\nThe fund is being set up as a Dutch-registered joint venture headed by Francois Dossa, a former banker who led Brazil operations for Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) and then for Nissan, the same people said. They declined to discuss specific investment plans.\nDespite Nissan\u2019s ambitions to market fully autonomous cars by 2022 as well as a robo-taxi service, the Japanese carmaker has largely eschewed startups, preferring partnerships with established players such as software group DeNA Co. ( 2432.T )\nRenault has made several such investments including Marcel, a Paris car-sharing platform, and Jedlix, a Dutch specialist in smart vehicle-charging technology. Renault\u2019s RCI Bank & Services arm took control of car-sharing aggregator Karhoo last year and plans to relaunch the business under alliance ownership.\nMost or all of the Renault investments will be transferred to the new alliance venture\u2019s portfolio, the sources said.\n($1 = 0.8286 euros)\nReporting by Laurence Frost; Additional reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Mark Potter\n "}

Rains that once stretched from October to March now fall only between December and February.\nA recent El Nino event \u2013 a warming of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific that often causes drought in southern Africa \u2013 aggravated already dry conditions, driving hunger not only in Madagascar but across southern Africa.\nThat El Nino has now ended, but many families have not recovered, and harsh weather continues, they say.\n\u201cThe air is more violent.

We don\u2019t know when it will come.\u201d\nIn Madagascar, nine in 10 people live on less than $2 a day, according to Unicef. Poverty is even worse in the dry south. Bumpy roads last paved in colonial days impede the delivery of aid, and mean even emergency transport is difficult.\nHoasie, a woman in her 40s who goes by one name, said she was forced to carry her 3-year-old son 20 kilometers to the nearest hospital in November, after large bumps broke out on his body.\nIt turned out he was suffering from acute malnutrition and a lack of protein. But the drought makes it difficult to feed him better, she said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re farmers, so when there is no rain we have no crops,\u201d she said.\nIn September, construction began on a much-needed pipeline that will carry clean water much closer to 13 thirsty communities in this area of southern Madagascar.\nThe pipeline, funded by Madagascar\u2019s Ministry of Water and Unicef and expected to be working by March, will provide household water for about 46,000 people.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency to complete this pipeline,\u201d said Heriniaina Rakotomalala, a civil engineer who works with Unicef on the project.\nChildren pose by the Mandrare River,in the Amboasary Sud area of southern Madagascar, November 9, 2017.

Now they live crammed together into a one-bedroom wooden shack.\nAt the moment the family still has six chickens. But the small plot of land they own is steadily decreasing in size, as they sell off bits to buy more food.\nSlideshow (4 Images) The family isn\u2019t the only one facing hard times.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no food and people are hungry. We only eat cactus seed and fruit. We cook it and boil it with water,\u201d said Rafoava Ravaonimira, 65, another resident of the village.\nShe said it was hardest to explain to the youngest children why they can only have one meal a day. \u201cThe older the kids grow, the more they understand.

In the south they burn forests for charcoal and agriculture.

He was looking to expand Ant Financial\u2019s footprint amid fierce domestic competition from Chinese rival Tencent Holdings Ltd\u2019s WeChat payment platform.\nMa, a Chinese citizen who appears frequently with leaders from the highest echelons of the Communist Party, had promised Trump in a meeting a year ago that he would create 1 million U.S. jobs.\nMoneyGram shares fell 8.5 percent in after-market trading.\nThe companies decided to terminate their deal after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) rejected their proposals to mitigate concerns over the safety of data that can be used to identify U.S. citizens, according to sources familiar with the confidential discussions.\n\u201cDespite our best efforts to work cooperatively with the U.S. government, it has now become clear that CFIUS will not approve this merger,\u201d MoneyGram Chief Executive Alex Holmes said in a statement on Tuesday.\nThe U.S. government has toughened its stance on the sale of companies to Chinese entities, at a time when Trump is trying to put pressure on China to help tackle North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions and be more accommodative on trade and foreign exchange issues.\nThe MoneyGram deal is the latest in a string of Chinese acquisitions of U.S. companies that have failed to clear CFIUS, including the $1.3 billion purchase by China-backed buyout fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC of U.S. chip maker Lattice Semiconductor Corp.\nIn November, China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co Ltd and Genworth Financial Inc extended a deadline to April 1 for the Chinese group\u2019s planned $2.7 billion takeover of the U.S. life insurer.\nAsked on Wednesday for Beijing\u2019s view on the deal\u2019s rejection, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said cooperation on economic and trade matters was of mutual benefit.\n\u201cWe hope the U.S. can create a fair and predictable environment for Chinese enterprises to invest and start up businesses,\u201d the spokesman said.\nHowever, commentary published after the deal\u2019s collapse by official news agency Xinhua went further, describing a fading bonhomie between the two countries, with the United States \u201cstuck in a zero-sum mentality\u201d.\nA logo of Ant Financial is displayed at the Ant Financial event in Hong Kong, China November 1, 2016. REUTERS\/Bobby Yip\/ Files \u201cChina and the United States are about to ride a bumpy journey in trade in 2018 if the U.S. government goes its own way, and retaliatory measures by China could be on the table,\u201d it said.\nFINANCIAL SERVICES DEALS The MoneyGram deal\u2019s demise is also the latest example of how CFIUS\u2019 focus on cyber security and the integrity of personal data is prompting it to block deals in sectors not traditionally associated with national security, such as financial services.\nThe U.S. Treasury said it is prohibited by statute from disclosing information filed with CFIUS and declined to comment on the MoneyGram deal.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Other U.S. financial services deals by Chinese firms are waiting for approval from CFIUS, including HNA Group Co\u2019s acquisition of hedge fund-of-funds firm SkyBridge Capital LLC from Anthony Scaramucci, the Trump administration\u2019s former communications director.\nSkyBridge and HNA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nDallas-based MoneyGram has approximately 350,000 remittance locations in more than 200 countries. Ant Financial was looking to take over MoneyGram not so much for its U.S. presence but to expand in growing markets outside of China.\nAnt Financial and MoneyGram said they will now explore and develop initiatives to work together in remittance and digital payments in China, India, the Philippines and other Asian markets, as well as in the United States. This cooperation will take the form of commercial agreements, one of the sources said.\nAny arrangements reached by Ant Financial and MoneyGram that do not involve a transaction would not be subject to review by CFIUS.\n\u201cWhat is more likely to happen at this point is that MoneyGram will sell to another company, and one company that has shown interest in the past is Euronet,\u201d said Gil Luria, an equity analyst at D.A.

Rangeland II owns and operates the RIO System , a multipart crude oil and frac sand logistics system originating in the heart of the Delaware Basin. The system provides access and optionality to multiple crude oil producers and end markets and consists of the RIO Pipeline System and the RIO Hub.\nThe all-cash transaction is expected to close early in the first quarter of 2018, subject to customary regulatory approvals. Substantially all of Rangeland II\u2019s field employees will be invited to remain with the asset as employees of Andeavor. The Rangeland II management team will focus on the expansion of Rangeland Energy III, LLC (\u201cRangeland III\u201d). Rangeland III is developing the STEPS logistics terminal in Corpus Christi and pursuing midstream opportunities in western Canada.\nSTEPS is an integrated hydrocarbon logistics system that will receive and store refined products, liquefied petroleum gas (\u201cLPG\u201d) and other hydrocarbons at a new terminal hub now under construction in Corpus Christi, Texas, and transport them to terminals primarily located in Mexico.\nRIO System Details\nThe RIO System is comprised of four core facilities, with additional facilities under development. The RIO Hub rail facility is located approximately 12 miles south of Carlsbad in Eddy County, New Mexico, and is the Delaware Basin\u2019s premier frac sand rail-unloading, storage and truck-loading facility. The RIO Pipeline consists of 110 miles of 12-inch crude oil pipeline, bridging the Delaware and Midland basins with connectivity at the State Line Terminal in Loving County, Texas, and the Geneva and Zurich terminals in Midland, Texas.

Since 2013, pedestrian deaths have fallen by 45 percent. \nWhile stressing that even a single traffic death is one too many, officials said that New York was moving in the opposite direction of the national trend.

REUTERS\/Regis Duvignau Exact figures have been kept under wraps ahead of an announcement on January 15, but the sources said Airbus handed over a record monthly total of jets in December, surpassing the previous monthly peak of 111 seen in the closing weeks of 2016.\nComing on top of 591 deliveries posted between January and November last year, that implies deliveries of at least 703 aircraft in 2017 as a whole, up at least 2 percent from 2016.\nA spokesman for Airbus declined comment.\nAirbus stuck throughout 2017 to an official target of more than 700 deliveries for the year, but abandoned a more ambitious informal goal of more than 720 deliveries in October due to continued delays in engine deliveries for the A320neo family.\nAirbus officials have said the delays have now eased, following a two-year wrangle with supplier Pratt & Whitney over late engines for the company\u2019s fastest-selling jet.\nIt is the second year in a row that Airbus has been forced to accelerate sharply in December, with that month\u2019s deliveries accounting for at least 16 percent of the annual total.\nWithout disclosing numbers, Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier thanked staff in a memo for \u201chuge collective efforts\u201d that had seen the company break records for deliveries logged both in one month and in one year, industry sources said.\nStill, insiders said the strong industrial performance would be seen by many as a personal coup for Bregier, weeks before he is due to leave the company after losing a bid to succeed Chief Executive Tom Enders, who is himself leaving in 2019.\nAirbus is bracing for more internal changes this year as it emerges from a top-level power struggle and rows over the handling of corruption investigations, but ended 2017 with what appears to be a grand slam performance from its current regime.\nBesides ending the year on record output, Airbus is also heading for a record December in new business after soon-to-retire sales chief John Leahy announced the firming up of more than 700 orders, equivalent to a year\u2019s production.\nBoth Leahy and Bregier are leaving Airbus in coming weeks, handing their responsibilities to executives from outside the planemaking inner circle: Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury, who will replace Bregier as head of the planemaking division, and Rolls-Royce civil engines head Eric Schulz, who will replace Leahy after he retires later this month.\nAirbus will remain in second place on deliveries in 2017 behind the world\u2019s largest planemaker, Boeing, but analysts say the outcome of the order race depends on how many of the new sales make it into the end-year tally of net orders.\nReporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Ingrid Melander and Geert De Clercq\n "}

{"published":"2018-01-10T18:54:00.000+02:00","title":"Special Report: How courts help companies keep sexual misconduct under cover","text":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cristina Chen-Oster, a senior salesperson in Goldman Sachs\u2019s convertible bonds department, was a few years out of MIT when a male colleague pinned her against a wall, kissed her, groped her and tried to engage in a sexual act, she said in a lawsuit in federal court. After reporting the incident to her boss, the lawsuit alleged, she missed out on pay and promotions while her accused attacker steadily rose through the ranks.\nCathy Sellars, a 59-year-old mother of two adult children, was training to become a truck driver for freight hauler CRST when she complained to her bosses about repeated sexual harassment by male colleagues, according to a class action lawsuit against the company. Her complaints ignored, she says in court records, she eventually found herself in a truck cab with a male driver who pulled a knife on her after she rebuffed his sexual advances. He then refused to allow her to exit the truck during a trip through the southwest and held her for several hours, she said.\nAnd Sebastian Kelly, a gay driver for an ambulance company in Alabama, said in a lawsuit that he worked in a sexually charged atmosphere, where two male co-workers routinely exposed their genitalia.\nNews headlines of late have focused on sexual harassment accusations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, former Today show anchor Matt Lauer, former U.S. Senator Al Franken and other media figures, entertainers and politicians. In each case, the accusers say they waited years to confront the men who accosted them, most of them too ashamed or fearful to complain publicly or persuaded to keep quiet by tactics meant to suppress the truth.\nBut these three plaintiffs, and many like them, chose to confront their alleged abusers and hold the companies they work for accountable in public court. Rather than opening the incidents to full public scrutiny, however, judges let companies push the legal boundaries of what should be considered confidential and to keep details of abusive behavior secret.\nA Reuters review of federal court cases filed between 2006 and 2016 revealed hundreds containing sexual harassment allegations where companies used common civil litigation tactics to keep potentially damning information under wraps. Plaintiffs in some cases say companies sought to conceal internal documents that reveal similar harassment claims, as well as corporate policies that favored abusers over victims.\nIn one case, plaintiff lawyers collected secret evidence about alleged criminal behavior, including details of a pharmaceutical saleswoman who alleged a doctor sexually assaulted her at a work-related event. Her supervisor admitted to giving a sheriff\u2019s detective false information about the allegations, court records show.\nTHE COST OF SECRECY The true number of such cases is likely much greater than the hundreds identified by Reuters. Federal courts categorize sexual harassment within a larger group of gender discrimination claims, which makes a full accounting difficult. In addition, many sexual harassment cases are filed in state courts. Reuters focused its review on the federal courts because records are more accessible and consistent.\nAs a result of the sealed documents, cases that could shine light on specific abusers, or on toxic corporate cultures, do the opposite: They enable the very secrecy and corporate complicity that allow sexual harassment to persist in the workplace.\nShira Scheindlin, a former Manhattan federal judge, said judges should make public human-resources complaints that result in employee discipline.\n\u201cOtherwise, you get the serial abuser just doing it at the next job,\u201d said Scheindlin, who currently heads the American Bar Association\u2019s federal courts subcommittee and whose private practice includes advising companies on handling sexual harassment complaints. \u201cIf that record had been available, there would have been no next job.\u201d\nU.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said courts are going too far in routinely sealing such cases. Documents filed in federal court are presumed to be public, he said, so people can understand how the judiciary works. Companies should not be allowed to cloak evidence just because it is damaging, said the judge, based in San Francisco. That goes not only for sexual harassment but also for broader corporate governance issues.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see why their private interests to avoid embarrassment trumps the public\u2019s right to have access to litigation,\u201d Breyer said.\nCompanies say they have good reason to seek broad protective orders. They frequently argue that their internal documents contain unproven allegations that shouldn\u2019t be public, or sensitive business information that could aid a competitor. Plaintiff attorneys say they often agree to protective orders and motions to seal information from public disclosure because fighting over public access can increase the length and cost of a lawsuit.\nMany judges, meanwhile, are reluctant to enforce transparency when neither side has requested it, according to several current and former federal judges.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any judge is presumptively hostile to the idea of disclosure,\u201d Breyer said. \u201cWe may be presumptively hostile to doing more work. I\u2019m speaking for myself.\u201d\nMost civil cases settle before they can be publicly aired before a jury. That means the pre-trial secrecy allows companies to permanently conceal information about their sexual harassment policies and how they respond to specific complaints of abuse.\nA broad protective order in the ongoing lawsuit by Chen-Oster and three other women against Goldman has allowed the Wall Street giant to keep hundreds of documents under wraps for three years.\nAsked about the secrecy, a Goldman spokesperson told Reuters the firm keeps details private because it promises employees confidentiality when they report concerns. The spokesperson would not discuss the specific allegations raised by Chen-Oster and the other plaintiffs.\nIn court documents, the company acknowledges that Chen-Oster told her boss about the contact with her co-worker and that the supervisor contacted Goldman\u2019s human resources department about it. Chen-Oster, the company says in court filings, did not want to pursue a human resources complaint.\nThe protective order permitted lawyers on either side to mark any document exchanged in discovery as confidential, thus barring anyone from disclosing it outside the case. Such orders have become standard to ensure secrecy during the pre-trial evidence discovery phase in U.S. civil litigation.\nThere are no nationwide standards on what information should be sealed when discovery documents are later filed in court. Several federal appeals courts recognize that trade secrets, sensitive financial data, or personal information like Social Security Numbers can remain secret. When it comes to allegations of misconduct, some case law allows information that would intrude on an individual\u2019s privacy to be kept secret. But it is left to judges to decide if someone\u2019s privacy outweighs the public\u2019s interest in disclosure.\nInitially, Chen-Oster\u2019s lawyers agreed to the protective order, but later, when they sought to broaden the case, they took the rare step of arguing that many documents filed in court should be made public.\nAdam Klein, one of her lawyers, said plaintiff"}

While some patients may use short-acting inhalers to quickly relieve occasional shortness of breath, people with more severe and persistent symptoms may be prescribed long-acting inhalers to help expand the airways and keep them open. \nCompared to COPD patients who didn\u2019t use long-acting bronchodilators, those who did were 50 percent more likely have cardiovascular problems like a heart attack or stroke within the first 30 days of starting to use these inhalers, the study found. \nThe absolute risk of problems like stroke, heart attack, rhythm disorders, and heart failure was still very low \u2013 around 1 percent \u2013 and the increased risk associated with long-acting bronchodilators disappeared over time, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine. \n\u201cPatients should know that their risk for cardiovascular diseases will be increased after initiation of bronchodilators even though the treatment is essential,\u201d said Dr. Tadahiro Goto, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \nWhile patients shouldn\u2019t stop using inhalers, they should be vigilant about seeking medical attention for symptoms that might indicate a heart problem, such as chest pains or a suddenly rapid heart beat, Goto said by email. \nTo assess the connection between long-acting bronchodilators and heart problems, researchers examined data on 284,220 adults with COPD who had never used these medicines. \nAt the start of the study, patients were 71 years old on average, and researchers followed them for an average of 2 years. During that time, 37,719 people developed severe heart problems requiring emergency medical care. \nResearchers looked at long-acting bronchodilators in two different families of medicines \u2013 beta-agonists and antimuscarinic antagonists \u2013 and didn\u2019t see a difference in the risk of heart disease based on the type of drug or the dose. \nThe study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how long-acting bronchodilators might influence the odds of severe heart problems in patients with COPD. \nWhile these medicines are designed to widen the airways, they may also accelerate the heart rate, constrict blood vessels and increase blood pressure, said lead study author Meng-Ting Wang, of the National Defense Medical Center in Taipei, Taiwan. \nLong-acting bronchodilators might also increase inflammation, which then leads to blockage of the blood vessels, Wang said by email. \nIt\u2019s also possible that heart problems that appear linked to the medications in the study might have been there all along and misdiagnosed in some patients, said Dr. Shawn Aaron, a researcher at the University of Ottawa Medical School who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \nPatients should have a follow-up exam after they start using these inhalers to make sure they\u2019re not having symptoms that might be caused by cardiovascular disease, Aaron advised. \n\u201cNo one should avoid these drugs if they are prescribed by a physician,\u201d said Dr. Prescott Woodruff, a researcher at the University of California San Francisco who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \n\u201cThey are very effective at improving lung function and reducing exacerbations in COPD,\u201d Woodruff said by email. \u201cThe initiation of these drugs, in this instance, can simply be a marker for worsening symptoms of COPD or cardiovascular disease that is mistaken for COPD.\u201d \nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2A6F4NM JAMA Internal Medicine, online January 2, 2018."}

In minutes from its last meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee revealed a lingering divide over low inflation even as the Fed moved to raise interest rates. Janet Yellen will preside over one more meeting before Fed governor Jerome Powell takes over as Fed chair in February, and he will be surrounded by a new group of more hawkish voices. 1 Hour Ago | 04:37 \nThe final interest rate hike of the Yellen era was met by the usual divided Fed, but the scales will now tip toward the more hawkish voices. \nThe Federal Open Market Committee approved a quarter-point rate hike at its late December meeting, with most officials backing the continued path of gradual rate hikes. But according to the minutes from the Fed meeting , released Wednesday, there were Fed officials who were concerned by low inflation expectations even as others said they thought the tight labor market and tax hikes could help boost inflation. \nAs Janet Yellen prepares to hand the baton to incoming chair Jerome Powell in early February, the Fed is already commanding a more hawkish tone. Economists are increasingly expecting a potential four rate hikes this year, versus the three currently forecast by the Fed. \n\"It just seems the usual. The so-called hawks at the Fed are gradualists who think monetary policy needs to be normalized as the economy normalizes,\" said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. \"They don't want to fall behind the curve.\" \nOn the other side are the so-called doves, who McCarthy described as \"still perpetually pessimistic. This dose of policy normalization is an anathema to them, and they'll grab onto any straw to slow down the process. Frankly, this is their last stand, and they lost.\" \nYellen's Fed was centered around a dovish core, including Yellen as Fed chair, former Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer and New York Fed President William Dudley. Fischer has recently left the Fed, and Dudley is expected to leave in the middle of the year. \nThe Yellen Fed has raised rates five times, the first hikes since the Fed took the fed funds rate to zero during the financial crisis. It also has begun a process to scale back the Fed's balance sheet, expanded to $4.5 trillion by quantitative easing under former Fed chair Ben Bernanke as he sought to boost the economy. \n\"The Fed likes to be proactive, but it's reactionary,\" said Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics. Swonk said the strengthening labor market and higher wages would have helped push the Fed to hike rates and will push it further. \nThe tax cuts should further pressure labor costs in the U.S. at the same time the job market is tightening. \"It's a whole new world to have labor markets tighten again. It's something employers are just beginning to grasp,\" Swonk said. \n\"What's going to be interesting to see is [wage growth.] We know that there's going to be these one time earnings and there's going to be minimum wage increases and that's going to start showing up,\" Swonk said. A number of companies have announced one time bonuses for employees since the tax bill was signed into law last month. \nAlso this year the FOMC loses some of its more dovish voices, like Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans. Both voted against the rate hike. They are leaving the FOMC as part of a normal rotation making way for other members who happen to be more hawkish, like Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester. \nThe Fed's next meeting is Jan. 30 and 31, and while it is Yellen's final meeting, there is not expected to be a rate hike. But the new Fed members could find their voices, including Randal Quarles, vice chair for supervision. \nPresident Donald Trump has also nominated former Fed official and Carnegie Mellon professor Marvin Goodfriend. \"He is a monetary policy scholar and one of his key criticisms of the Fed is they shouldn't fall behind the curve on inflation,\" said McCarthy. \nSluggish inflation has been an ongoing issue for the Fed, with some members expecting an eventual return to the Fed's 2 percent target and others wondering if there are other negative issues holding it back. \nThe market, during the Yellen era, was highly skeptical the Fed would raise rates because of low inflation, but as the Powell Fed and its new members are about to take over that view is changing, in part because the economy has accelerated and the tax cuts mean it could accelerate further. \n\"At the end of the day, the question is what happens to interest rates longer term,\" said Swonk. \"The economy is doing better, and the Fed is going to have to react to that.\" Patti Domm CNBC Markets Editor Playing"}

The Company expects to close the acquisition in the first quarter of 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nArlington Tower, Rosslyn, VA\nLocated at 1300 North 17 th Street, two blocks from the Rosslyn Metro station, Arlington Tower has a Walk Score\u00ae of 95 and offers instant commuter access to Interstate 66, Route 50 and the George Washington Parkway. Built in 1980 and extensively renovated in the past five years with capital improvements of approximately $16 million, this 19-story office building sits near the Potomac River with panoramic river and monument views.\nWashington REIT has also executed a non-binding Letter of Intent with an institutional buyer to sell 2445 M Street NW, its 292,000 square foot DC office building where the sole tenant, the Advisory Board Company, is expected to vacate on May 31, 2019.

The company's \"architecture differences\" have proven immune to the more problematic one of the two disclosed vulnerabilities. \nBritish tech website The Register reported Tuesday that some Intel processors have a \"fundamental design flaw\" and security issue, which spurred the company to confirm the problem later in the day. \nAMD shares are up 10.4 percent in the two days through Thursday following the report, while Intel's stock declined 5.2 percent in the period, wiping out $11.3 billion of shareholder value. \nOne of the two vulnerabilities, called Meltdown, affects Intel processors. The other, named Spectre, could affect chips from Intel, AMD and Arm. \nIntel said Wednesday that performance degradation after security updates for Meltdown \"should not be significant\" for the average user. But on a call with investors, the company admitted a decrease in performance of up to 30 percent was possible after fixes under some \"synthetic workloads.\" \nBank of America Merrill Lynch told clients the big Intel performance hits were \"likely for enterprise and server workloads.\" \nOn the flip side, AMD said any performance hits will be \"negligible\" after Spectre-related security software updates and there is \"near zero risk of exploitation.\" The company also confirmed it is not affected by Meltdown due to processor \"architecture differences.\" \nResearchers and Apple said Spectre is more difficult to exploit. \nMultiple Wall Street analysts predicted AMD will take advantage of the Intel's security issues. \nAMD could use it as \"a marketing edge given differing architectures and no vulnerability yet,\" Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. \nIntel's high-profit data-center business, which sells server chips to cloud computing providers and enterprises, is the chipmaker's crown jewel. \nRakesh noted that Intel had 99 percent market share of the data-center market, representing a huge opportunity for AMD. \nAnalysts estimate that Intel's data-center group will generate $18.5 billion in sales and $7.4 billion in operating profit in 2017, according to FactSet. \n\"Longer-term customers could be more motivated to find alternatives at AMD and possibly ARM ( CAVM benefits) to diversify the architectural risks,\" Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya wrote Thursday. \"AMD appears poised to be the most direct beneficiary.\" \nAn AMD gain of significant market share in the server market is not unprecedented. The company hit 25 percent share in 2006. If AMD is able to reach 10 percent or 15 percent market share of the data-center business, it could add billions in revenue to the company's financial results. \nAny increase will be a boon for AMD because the Wall Street consensus for the company's 2017 estimated sales is just $5.25 billion. \nOne leading tech industry analyst says the chipmaker will do just that. \n\"The news of Intel's processor security issue and the potential performance degradation to correct it comes at an inopportune time as Intel currently faces heavy competitive pressure from its long-time nemesis, AMD,\" Fred Hickey, editor of High Tech Strategist, wrote in an email Thursday. \"AMD's new line of chips is a significant challenger for the first time in many years (since AMD's Opteron chip days).\" \nAMD launched new line Epyc data-center processors to much fanfare last June with design wins at cloud computing providers Microsoft Azure and Baidu.\"For Intel, it likely means loss of market share (lower revenues) as well as loss of pricing power (lower gross margins) as the advantage shifts to the buyers and away from Intel, which has totally dominated the PC\/computer server processor market in recent years,\" Hickey said. \"AMD's new processor chips already had momentum and that momentum will likely be propelled further by the recent security issue disclosures.\""}

VIP provides a comprehensive suite of services at its 2,900 community clinics and wellness centers hosted at local pet retailers across 31 states, which includes diagnostic tests, vaccinations, prescription medications, microchipping and wellness checks.

In 2017, VIP treated more than one million pets through its installed clinics as well as its 76,000 mobile clinics.\n\u201cWe look forward to working closely with Will Santana, Chief Executive Officer of VIP, who will be joining the PetIQ Board of Directors as well as our senior management team in connection with the closing of the transaction, and to welcoming the entire VIP team to the PetIQ family.

PetIQ believes the combination will provide several strategic and financial benefits, including the following:\nVeterinary Services Complement PetIQ\u2019s Current Business and Significantly Expands the Company\u2019s Addressable Market: Following the closing of the acquisition, the combination of PetIQ\u2019s existing business with VIP\u2019s products and services businesses is expected to expand PetIQ\u2019s addressable market by nearly 285%, from $8.6 billion to over $29 billion. PetIQ will have the ability to provide its retail partners complementary veterinary products and services, which the Company believes will enable PetIQ to continue to generate a high rate of growth over the long-term. In addition, PetIQ expects the transaction to create an additional high-margin growth vehicle in the veterinary services industry, which is expected to expand at a 6% CAGR through 2021, according to Packaged Facts, U.S. Pet Market Outlook \u2013 May 2017.\nCreates a Pet Wellness Veterinary Products and Services Platform: Together, PetIQ and VIP expect to generate approximately $450 million to $500 million of pro-forma net sales and approximately $40 million to $45 million of pro-forma adjusted EBITDA for the calendar year ending December 31, 2018, which adjusts for the impact of elimination of VIP\u2019s sales to PetIQ. The acquisition is expected to further diversify PetIQ\u2019s current net sales mix, with the combined veterinarian products business representing approximately 75% of net sales and the services business representing approximately 25% of net sales, based on aforementioned pro forma net sales for the calendar year ending December 31, 2018.\nFurther Diversifies and Strengthens National Retail Customer Base: PetIQ\u2019s acquisition of VIP is expected to further strengthen the Company\u2019s existing partnerships with leading U.S. retailers and strengthen the Company\u2019s ability to develop new retail customers. Additional opportunity exists to expand distribution of PetIQ\u2019s veterinary-grade products to current VIP customers, and provides for the potential delivery of VIP\u2019s veterinary services to PetIQ\u2019s existing network of customers.\nAddition of Experienced Executive Team: The transaction will build upon PetIQ\u2019s leadership team through the addition of VIP\u2019s talented group of executives with substantial operational experience in the animal health and wellness industry and a proven track record of growth. The VIP management team will remain in place, with Will Santana joining PetIQ\u2019s Board of Directors and continuing as Chief Executive Officer of the wholly-owned subsidiary, which reflects VIP\u2019s commitment and belief in the future success of the combined company.\nTransaction Details\nUnder the terms of the transaction agreement, VIP will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of PetIQ. The transaction is valued at approximately $220 million, comprised of $100 million in cash, up to an additional $30 million payable pursuant to promissory notes issued to VIP Petcare Holdings, Inc.

The company also said Windows Server performance will be degraded if customers choose to install updates that are meant to protect against untrusted code. SHARES Getty Images \nMicrosoft on Tuesday provided new details on the performance impact of updates to protect against recently disclosed security vulnerabilities. In certain cases, performance on Windows will be significantly slowed by patches for the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities . \nSome people have found that their servers and PCs are performing differently after installing updates, so the news shouldn't come as a big surprise. Still, the new information doesn't line up perfectly well with what Intel said last week when the vulnerabilities were first officially announced. \"Any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant,\" the chipmaker said . \nMicrosoft expects most people using Windows 7 and Windows 8 on chips that are from 2015 or older will notice performance degradations, Terry Myerson, executive vice president for Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, wrote in a blog post . The company did not publish specific performance benchmarks to back up the claims. \nSome people using Windows 10 with Intel Haswell chips or anything older will notice performance impacts, Myerson wrote. But those people running Windows 10 on Skylake, Kaby Lake or newer Intel chips probably won't notice performance issues, although internally run benchmarks show single-digit slowdowns, Myerson wrote. \nThe case is different for Windows Server, Microsoft's operating system for servers. Should customers choose to install updates to protect against issues stemming from untrusted code running on those machines, there will be a more significant performance impact, Myerson wrote. \"This is why you want to be careful to evaluate the risk of untrusted code for each Windows Server instance, and balance the security versus performance tradeoff for your environment,\" he wrote. \nAt this point, Microsoft has provided Meltdown and Spectre patches for 41 of the 45 versions of Windows through Windows Update, Myerson wrote. \nIntel stock went down after Microsoft released the news. It traded as low as $43.75, about 2 percent lower than opening price, falling from about $44.34 per share immediately after the announcement. Microsoft stock initially faltered but then reversed its decline. \nLater on Tuesday Intel offered new details on PC performance impacts because of security updates. \n\"Based on our most recent PC benchmarking, we continue to expect that the performance impact should not be significant for average computer users. This means the typical home and business PC user should not see significant slowdowns in common tasks such as reading email, writing a document or accessing digital photos,\" Intel said in a statement . The testing on PCs with the latest Intel silicon found an impact of 6 percent or less, the company said. \nIntel said it's still trying to get a sense of performance changes for chips used in data centers.

Landing that kind of kick-started my professional career. I then started getting invites to big events like X Games and doing well in them. \n\u201cThat gave me the confidence I needed to go to events knowing that I belonged there and I started getting more World Cup podiums so it really helped me out, did that.\u201d \nIn a sport where boundaries are there to be broken, Ormerod knows that her rivals will be trying to raise the bar in South Korea next month. But she exudes the quiet confidence of an athlete at the top of her profession. \nIn 2016 she was third in slopestyle at the X Games in Aspen and last year in Moscow she became the first Briton to win a World Cup big air title. There were also numerous podium finishes in big air and slopestyle, including in Pyeongchang at a competition that served as a test event. \nShe began this year with a big air second place in Milan. \nIt has not all been plain sailing though. \nShe has broken both wrists and a shoulder and last March she said she \u201cgot lucky\u201d when breaking her back during a qualification accident at the freestyle world championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain. \n\u201dThere have been plenty of bumps and bruises,\u201c she said with a heavy dose of under-statement. \u201dIt was the first day of training in Spain and I went way too big on one of the jumps and landed flat on my back and chipped a bit off the L3 vertebrae. \n\u201dWasn\u2019t the best news being told I had broken my back. But it could have been a lot worse. I was able to walk and had six-week rehabilitation. Luckily my gymnastics background helped because I could work away from the snow. \n\u201cGymnastics is the closest thing to snowboarding and it\u2019s a safer environment and I could test myself before getting back on the board.\u201d \nDespite most of the team learning their craft on artificial slopes, Britain has several ski and snowboard medal shouts at the Games next month, courtesy of strong financial backing and attention to detail in all aspects of the various disciplines. \nBut none will travel with more expectation than Ormerod who is tipped to better the performance of Jenny Jones whose bronze in snowboard slopestyle in Sochi was the nation\u2019s first on snow. \n\u201cI am feeling really confident for the Olympics and I am hoping to bring back a medal because last season was the best season I have had,\u201d Ormerod, who will also compete in the \u2018obstacle course\u2019 like event of slopestyle, said. \n\u201cI was super-gutted not to make Sochi. So I want to go there to Pyeongchang and show the world what I can do, ride to my best and bring back a medal.\u201d Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty"}

Immigration legislation, in particular a plan to help people who were brought to the United States illegally as children, is also on the agenda.\nHow and when to execute those priorities must be decided. While Trump and McConnell want to work on infrastructure first, Ryan is more interested in tackling welfare.\nA White House official said the timing of legislation would be discussed as well as the political priority of giving Republicans substantive issues to highlight ahead of November elections when the party will seek to maintain control of Congress.\nAll 435 members in the House and a third of the 100 members in the Senate will be up for re-election. A Democratic takeover of one or both chambers could help stifle Trump\u2019s agenda.\nThe meeting at the presidential retreat in Maryland, which will include Trump Cabinet officials, follows an uproar over the description in a new book of an inept Trump White House and Bannon\u2019s suggestion the president\u2019s son and son-in-law committed treason by meeting with a Russian official during the 2016 campaign.\nTrump broke with Bannon on Wednesday, saying his former adviser had \u201clost his mind,\u201d in a statement issued after comments attributed to Bannon in Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d were made public..\nALIGNING PRIORITIES The strategy session will provide an opportunity to switch topics after the furor over the book, which goes on sale on Friday.\n\u201cThe White House doesn\u2019t mind the optics after a few days of the president unloading on Bannon and making our views clear on the book, the president sits down and charts the course forward ... with the actual leaders of the Republican Party,\u201d a White House official said.\nTrump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Thursday that Wolff\u2019s book was a \u201ccomplete fantasy\u201d filled with tabloid gossip. She called for the conservative outlet Breitbart News to consider parting ways with Bannon, who leads the group and had pledged to campaign for anti-establishment Republican candidates in the 2018 elections.\nSenate Republican Whip John Cornyn said the weekend meeting would help lawmakers and administration officials get on the same page about their priorities.\n\u201cThis administration came into office perhaps not really knowing for sure that they would win the election, and was a little bit behind the curve in terms of preparing. Now I think they\u2019ve recognized that that sort of coordination is really important in order to get things done,\u201d he said.\n\u201dSo I look forward to having those conversations and making sure that the president\u2019s priorities and our priorities are aligned.\u201d (Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell and Steve Holland; Editing by Peter Cooney)\n "}

The \"Greyball\" software identified regulators who were trying to hail a ride in an attempt to collect evidence of local law-breaking. Those rides would be canceled or never arrive. It has also been reported that the Justice Department was investigating whether Uber illegally used software to track drivers of its rival Lyft.\nBloomberg reported that authorities in Montreal were seeking evidence in May 2015 that Uber had violated tax laws. Uber's use of Ripley meant they didn't get any information, but Uber cooperated with a second search warrant and agreed to collect provincial taxes for each ride, Bloomberg said.\nEnsign said the company shut down Ripley in 2016 because it didn't work well.\nShe said Uber now has a tool called ULocker that can remotely lock and encrypt devices. Ensign could not immediately say if Uber has used that to protect data from law enforcement as well. But she said Uber's guidance to employees bars use of the tool where it isn't legal.\nIn a statement, Uber said this security tool is similar to those used by other companies and gives them a way to block access to data when an employee loses a device.

Tanks holding fuel of state-owned company Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) are seen at a storage facility, in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico October 4, 2017. REUTERS\/Jose Luis Gonzalez\/File Photo \nFuel exports from the United States to Mexico have shot up by about 40 percent over the last two years. Today, Mexico stands as the top U.S. export market - absorbing about 1 million barrels a day, worth roughly $20 billion annually in trade. And no slowdown is on the horizon. \nFor one thing, experts say, Mexico faces supply constraints due to the poor condition of many of its refineries; for another, the country keeps adding cars, to its roads. \nOil companies have taken note, and are turning to rail shipments to move oil products across the U.S.-Mexico border. Leasing rates for some tank cars have doubled, while a clutch of new projects are underway to expand the rail infrastructure. \nPerhaps most telling: Kansas City Southern, the fourth-largest U.S. railroad, saw fuel shipments to Mexico jump over 200 percent in 2017. \n\u201cThere is a tremendous opportunity to move product into Mexico effectively by rail,\u201d said Daniel Gordon, executive vice president of business development and strategy at refining company Delek U.S. Holdings Inc.. \nTraditionally, companies moved fuel into Mexico by cargo ship, loaded it on trucks or pipelines and transported it to the country\u2019s interior. But Mexico only has two major ports that handle half of all its fuel shipments. Moreover, poor road conditions and volume constraints make trucking expensive and slow, and its pipelines suffer from underinvestment, according to industry executives. \nDelek\u2019s fuel shipments to Mexico by rail surged to 120,000 barrels in September, about six times what they were at the start of the year. Another company, 4J Energy of Houston, started railing diesel into Mexico in September and is a partner with one of the companies building a terminal in central Mexico. \nExxon Mobil imported its first large U.S. fuel cargo by rail in December. \u201cIt is an efficient way, a safe way,\u201d said Martin Proske, Mexico Fuels director for Exxon Mobil. SECURITY AND COSTS \nCross border rail trade is dominated by Kansas City Southern, whose tracks reach the densely-populated interior of the country, including Mexico City. \nIts rail lines can move fuel to centers of demand without the use of trucks, or pipelines owned by Mexico\u2019s Pemex that cannot guarantee safe delivery. Shippers are on the hook for the majority of losses incurred on pipelines. \nWhile several pipeline projects are proceeding, rail holds the advantage, said Patrick Ottensmeyer, Kansas City Southern\u2019s chief executive. \n\u201cThe railroad is already built. Building terminals, buying equipment, all of that is easy compared to building a 1,000-to-1,500-mile pipeline,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe have at least a three-to-five-year head start on pipelines.\u201d \nThe company is investing in terminals capable of handling high volume shipments of fuel - up to 60,000 barrels in a single trip. In 2017, it announced partnerships with Watco Companies, WTC Industrial and Bulkmatic worth nearly $50 million to build storage terminals in Mexico. \nAlthough Kansas City Southern has long moved a variety of goods to Mexico by rail - including grains and autos - fuel has only recently emerged as a growing business. \nIt shipped about 6,350 carloads of fuel across the border in the third quarter excluding the impact from hurricanes, up from 1,675 in the first quarter, while revenue during the timeframe quadrupled to $16 million. \nHauling fuel by rail is generally more expensive than pipelines. The cost to ship 1,000 tons of fuel is $6 per kilometer for pipelines versus $37 for rail and $83 for trucks, said Eugenio Lohr, principal at The Boston Consulting Group in Mexico City. \nBut that equation is changing in Mexico because of theft by gangs siphoning fuel from pipelines. During 2016, Pemex identified 6,873 illegal taps, up more than 30 percent from 2015. In all, thieves stole more than $1 billion worth of gasoline and diesel, according to Pemex. \nMeanwhile, rail investment is spreading. Among those building terminals is Rangeland Energy, which is constructing a new terminal hub in Corpus Christi, Texas, to transport fuel primarily by rail to terminals in Mexico. \nIn Mexico, USD Group, a Houston-based company, is building a petroleum products terminal about 150 miles northwest of Mexico City. A rail loading terminal is already online in Beaumont, Texas, owned by midstream energy firm Jefferson Energy Companies, to export refined products to Mexico. \nThe Mexican market has also become a boon for tank car leasing companies. Lease rates for older tank cars being phased out in the United States that can still be used in Mexico have jumped to roughly $500 a month, up from $200 six months ago, according to Tom Williamson, owner of Transportation Consultants. \n4J Energy, which currently ships 80 railcars per month of diesel, expects to begin gasoline shipments by January and overall volumes to reach more than 100 railcars a month by February. \n\u201cWe foresee fantastic growth in this segment of the business,\u201d said Jay Harbison, the company\u2019s president.

It would replace the Obama administration's five-year leasing plan, and is expected to open up more areas to offshore drilling, including previously off-limits federal waters off the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific coasts.\nWeeks before leaving office, former President Barack Obama had banned new oil and gas drilling in federal waters in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, protecting 115 million acres (46.5 million hectares) of waters off Alaska and 3.8 million acres in the Atlantic from New England to the Chesapeake Bay.\nBut Trump last April ordered the Interior Department to overhaul the existing offshore drilling plan.\nIn his executive order, Trump said it was U.S. policy to \"encourage energy exploration and production... in order to maintain the nation's position as a global energy leader and foster energy security and resilience for the benefit of the American people.\"\nThe proposal comes as low oil prices and soaring onshore production have curtailed industry demand for offshore leases, raising questions about the benefits of the move.\nAhead of Thursday's announcement, lawmakers from both parties, environmental groups, and local business leaders along the Atlantic coast said they are opposed to any effort to open up their coastlines to drilling rigs, citing environmental risks and threats to their lucrative tourism industries.\nA spokesman for Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott said in a statement on Wednesday that he \"is aggressively fighting to protect Floridas environment by proposing more than $3.8 billion to preserve it.\"\nCoastal tourism business groups are girding for a long fight against the Interior Department.\nFrank Knapp, founder of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, accused the Interior Department of favoring the oil and gas sector over the tourism sector.\nWhat part of the business sector are they listening to?

Breakthroughs in everything from patient monitoring to sleep apnea are coming from Silicon Valley and could dramatically shift the current paradigm. \nThe Cleveland Clinic, for the past 10 years, has put together an annual list of expected medical innovations for the coming year . In that time, says Chief Wellness Officer Dr. Michael Roizen, who leads the initiative, the group has truly missed only one prediction. While the group has occasionally been a bit premature in some of its estimates, he says, the predictions have ultimately come true. \nMore from Modern Medicine: Apple urged to take action on smartphone addiction some call 'digital heroin' \nTo make the predictions, the group interviews more than 150 physicians, 30 to 40 venture capitalists and a handful of media who cover the medical industry across the country to get their collective thoughts on what's imminent. That list is then honed, eliminating long-shot candidates, and goes through a double-elimination vote among physicians and venture capitalists. Nominees are thoroughly vetted, and the groups eliminate candidates throughout the process. \nHere's some of what the group expects to see this year. Gene therapy for inherited retinal diseases David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images A researcher tests gene therapy in Point Richmond, California. \nIn a historic move, the FDA has approved gene therapy for inherited retinal diseases . The approval signals a new era for gene therapy, which suffered setbacks for years but is now pressing forward. \nPatients that have a defective gene called RPE65 \u2014 which is responsible for producing a protein that makes light receptors in the eye \u2014 suffer from leber congenital amaurosis and retinitis pigmentosa, yet now have hope. \nThe treatment made by Spark Therapeutics is called Luxturna. It is injected into the eye and uses a benign virus to deliver healthy copies of the gene to the retina. \nWhile not a cure, it can improve eyesight substantially, according to researchers. But it comes with a whopping price tag: $850,000 per onetime treatment. show chapters 10:34 AM ET Wed, 3 Jan 2018 | 01:45 \nThis breakthrough can be a big first step in medicine. \"If you look at cancer, we know the majority of cancer starts with a DNA defect,\" Dr. Roizen says. \"And that DNA defect can be corrected or ameliorated. Say you have a family who has in vitro fertilization; they will examine the genes of the embryo before it gets implanted to see if it has any problems \u2014 and if so, can we intervene and change that problem? \u2026 This has a huge potential that is just going to start to break through.\" \nThe Cleveland Clinic's not the only group that's bullish on gene therapy. Health24 listed it as one of the 10 advancements to expect this year as well. Big reductions in LDL cholesterol Maurizio De Angelis | Science Photo Library | Getty Images Computer illustration of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or bad cholesterol, molecules. \nBad cholesterol, known as low-density lipoprotein (LDL), is a major factor in heart disease. And certain new drug combinations can lower LDL levels by 75 percent. PCSK9 inhibitors, along with statins, have proved especially powerful at reducing bad cholesterol numbers. That, says Roizen, could also help people truly change their lifestyles to focus more on healthy living. \nA number of trials are testing this theory now to see just how low LDL levels should go. Doctors now have the tools and research to help reduce cardiovascular death. A new kind of patient monitoring Hero Images | Getty Images \nPart of the reason an intensive care unit is so chaotic is because alarms are constantly going off \u2014 and they're not always critical. (One study, says Roizen, found that 80 percent of hospital alarms were deemed unnecessary.) \nBig data is starting to inch its way into the hospital and this year could be a turning point, as \"mission control\" operations monitor those alarms and alert staff when things require intervention. Those stations can spot trends that harried health-care employees can't as they rush from crisis to crisis. And using artificial intelligence algorithms, they can predict which patients will get in trouble and let doctors and nurses intervene, ideally before it becomes critical. \nSimilarly, hospitals are discharging patients quicker than ever these days. But follow-up appointments with doctors can be challenging \u2014 and are certainly inconvenient, since the patient has to drive (or be driven) to the doctor's office for what often amounts to a five-minute appointment. \n\"Well over 80 percent of our post-op patients now see their surgeon every day via \u2026 an app on the iPhone, where they can show the wound and talk to the doctor,\" says Roizen. \"It's an ease of convenience so the patient doesn't have to come in for the one-week checkup. Instead, they can be seen every day.\" A better night's sleep Juanmonino | Getty Images Man sleeping, using a mask for apnea sleep disorder treatment. \nSleep apnea affects 22 million people and can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke. Popular treatments, like a CPAP machine, might be effective, but they still make sleeping difficult for people with sleep apnea. That's why it is estimated that more than 40 percent of sleep apnea patients refuse to wear the device. \nNeuromodulation is a new way to treat apnea. Think of it as a pacemaker for poor sleepers. The implant is controlled by a wearable patch that is worn during sleep that stimulates the patient and ensures key airwaves are kept open during sleep. Clinical tests have been encouraging, and they're certainly more comfortable for patients than a CPAP device. \n\"It's really in its infancy, but this will replace CPAP in 50 to 70 percent of patients eventually,\" predicts Roizen. \"It will bring partners together again, as opposed to them sleeping in other rooms.\" An artificial pancreas Frederucj Florin | AFP | Getty Images A woman wears an early prototype of a bio-artificial pancreas (BAP) at the European Center for the Study of Diabetes on July 3, 2014, in Strasbourg, eastern France. \nDiabetes kills more Americans every year than AIDS and breast cancer combined, according to the American Diabetes Association.

Seemingly everyone weighed in on the subjects. \nCryptocurrency, the more controversial of the two, had its fair share of detractors. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was focused on people using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for \u201cillicit activity.\u201d UK Prime Minister Theresa May urged governments to take the criminal risks \u201cvery seriously.\u201d And International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde exhorted that \u201cthe way in which [cryptocurrency] conceals and protects money laundering and financing of terrorism, is just unacceptable\u201d\u2014while adding, hopefully, \u201cthere will be innovations coming out of these movements.\u201d \nBlockchains, on the other hand, drew heaps of praise. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz lauded the technology as \u201ca true piece of genius.\u201d Lagarde called it \u201cfascinating.\u201d And billionaire investor George Soros extolled the virtues, saying blockchains \u201ccan be put to positive use,\u201d including by \u201chelping migrants to communicate with their families and to keep their money safe and carry it with them.\u201d \nI didn\u2019t attend this year\u2019s World Economic Forum, but just a few hundred kilometers north of the Alpine retreat I hosted a panel on digital identity and fraud at M\u00fcnich\u2019s Digital Life Design conference. One participant, Timothy Ruff, cofounder and CEO of Evernym, a startup that\u2019s developing a blockchain for identity , spoke eloquently about the technology\u2019s potential for humanitarian aid. His remarks held special significance in the Bavarian city, where an influx of migrants from war-torn Syria\u2014many lacking official government documents\u2014have found refuge. \nBut Ruff\u2019s rosy vision had its skeptics. Esther Dyson , the investor (whose father is famed physicist Freeman), noted from the audience that even though \u201cself sovereign\u201d identity\u2014the idea that people should ultimately be in control of their own data\u2014sounds nice, it\u2019s a misleadingly simplistic notion. Technology alone cannot easily overcome socioeconomic and political challenges, Dyson suggested. People have less control over their identities than they might believe; consider those living under oppressive regimes, or in places where organized or other crime runs rampant. Are you \u201cself sovereign\u201d when there\u2019s a gun to your head? Not quite. \nBlockchains\u2014and cryptocurrencies\u2014are innovations that offer humanity extraordinary, transformative potential. But let us not delude ourselves into believing one or the other will categorically cure\u2014or aggravate\u2014all the world\u2019s ills. As in all things, we must respect the nuances. \nHave a great weekend. \n@rhhackett \nrobert.hackett@fortune.com \nWelcome to the Cyber Saturday edition of Data Sheet, Fortune\u2019 s daily tech newsletter.

Top tech companies like SAP, Symantec, and McAfee have allowed Russian authorities to inspect their software source code for flaws, Reuters reports . The practice raises concerns since it may help Moscow\u2019s hackers find vulnerabilities across federal agencies, where these companies\u2019 products are pervasively installed. HPE was discovered to have permitted similar reviews in the past. \nHelp wanted. Google parent Alphabet on Wednesday debuted Chronicle , the latest graduate from its moonshot factory X. The cybersecurity concern aims to help companies defend themselves from digital attacks by helping security teams manage floods of threat-related data in concert with another Google product, VirusTotal, which catalogues malware. The unit is headed by Stephen Gillett , who formerly worked at Symantec and Starbucks. (Fun fact: Gillett also appeared on Fortune\u2019s 40 Under 40 list eight years ago.) \nWe can rebuild him. While speaking at the World Economic Forum this week, Maersk\u2019s chairman Jim Hagermann Snabe revealed the extent of a recent cyberattack\u2019s damage to the shipping giant\u2019s IT systems. The NotPetya ransomware worm forced the company\u2019s tech team to reinstall \u201ca complete infrastructure\u201d over 10 days, he said. The crew set up \u201c4,000 new servers, 45,000 new PCs, and 2,500 applications\u201d to the tune of $250 to $300 million. \nWhen can you start? The Democratic National Committee has appointed Bob Lord , formerly of Yahoo, as its first ever chief security officer. He\u2019ll be in charge of bolstering the digital fortifications of the organization as well as that of state parties ahead of the 2018 mid-term elections. During his brief tenure at Yahoo, Lord cleaned up the aftermath of two devastatingly large data breaches that compromised more than a billion accounts. Seems like the right man for the job. \nSmile, election hackers, you\u2019re on candid camera ! \nShare today\u2019s Data Sheet with a friend: \nLooking for previous Data Sheets? Click here . ACCESS GRANTED \u201cI personally believe that there is going to be a one or a few legitimate trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology.

(SpaceX), speaks during the 67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Tuesday, Sept. 27, 2016. comments \nA military satellite launched by Elon Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies hasn\u2019t been spotted in orbit by the U.S. Strategic Command, creating a mystery about the fate of the classified payload and doubts about whether the mission was a success. \nThe mission \u2014 referred to by the code name Zuma \u2014 took off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida Sunday on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket . But the Strategic Command, which monitors more than 23,000 man-made objects in space, said it is not tracking any new satellites since the launch. \n\u201cWe have nothing to add to the satellite catalog at this time,\u201d Navy Captain Brook DeWalt, a spokesman for the command, said in an email when asked if the new satellite was in orbit. \nA U.S. official and two congressional aides, all familiar with the launch, said on condition of anonymity that the second-stage of SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 booster rocket failed. The satellite was lost, one of the congressional aides said, and the other said both the satellite and the second-stage satellite fell into the ocean after the failure. \n\u201cWe do not comment on missions of this nature; but as of right now reviews of the data indicate Falcon 9 performed nominally,\u201d James Gleeson, a spokesman for SpaceX, said in an email. \nRead: Look at These Incredible Photos of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy Rocket \nTim Paynter, a spokesman for Northrop noc , which was commissioned by the Defense Department to choose the launch contractor, said \u201cwe cannot comment on classified missions,\u201d and Army Lieutenant Colonel Jamie Davis, the Pentagon\u2019s spokesman for space policy, referred questions to SpaceX. \nThe launch is SpaceX\u2019s first in what was expected to be a busy year. The company has said it plans to launch about 30 missions in 2018 after completing a record 18 last year. The launch had been pushed back several times since late 2017, with the past week\u2019s extreme weather on the East Coast contributing to the most recent delay. \nThe Zuma mission was a clear success on at least one count: SpaceX successfully landed the rocket\u2019s first stage for reuse in a future launch, a key step in its goal to drive down the cost of access to space. \nSpaceX\u2019s 23-minute webcast of the Zuma launch Sunday evening included the Falcon 9 launch, confirmation that the fairings deployed, and the rocket\u2019s first-stage recovery on land in Florida. Cheers from employees could be heard from Mission Control at the company\u2019s headquarters in Hawthorne, California. \nThe webcast then concluded. During missions for commercial satellite customers, SpaceX typically returns to the webcast to confirm that the payload has separated from the second stage, but Zuma was a classified mission so the lack of further messages wasn\u2019t surprising. \nSpaceX, the closely held company founded and led by chief executive officer Elon Musk \u2014 who also heads the electric auto manufacturer Tesla tsla \u2014 is slated to demonstrate the maiden flight of Falcon Heavy, a larger and more powerful rocket, later this month. SpaceX, along with Boeing ba , also has a contract with NASA to fly astronauts to the International Space Station as part of the \u201cCommercial Crew\u201d program, with the first crucial test flight slated for the second quarter. \nSpaceX competes for military launches with United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin lmt , which was the sole provider for the Pentagon until Musk launched a campaign in Congress and the courts challenging what he called an unfair monopoly. After a rigorous Air Force review, SpaceX was certified in 2015 to compete for military launches. Related Articles"}

Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind U.S. President Donald Trump during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, U.S., November 1, 2017. REUTERS\/Kevin Lamarque \nKushner Cos was asked by the SEC for information on its use of the visa program, known as EB-5, in May 2017, according to a person the Journal said was familiar with the matter. \nThe EB-5 visa is a method for eligible immigrants to become lawful permanent residents, or \u201cgreen card\u201d holders, by investing at least $500,000 (\u00a3368,552) into a business in the United States that will employ 10 or more American workers. Most holders are wealthy Chinese individuals. \nThe Journal said the company also received a separate request from New York federal prosecutors in the same month for information on development projects financed in part by the EB-5 program. \nKushner, the White House and New York prosecutors did not reply to requests for comment from Reuters. The SEC could not be reached for comment. \n\u201cAs we said months ago, we are cooperating with all government requests for information about our past legal use of the EB-5 program,\u201d a Kushner Cos representative said in a statement to Reuters. \nThe exact subject of the SEC\u2019s inquiry, or whether it identified particular projects, is not clear, the Journal reported. \nThe Kushners\u2019 use of EB-5 visas to raise cash to finance developments came to broad attention in May last year, when Kushner\u2019s sister, Nicole Kushner, spoke at a publicly advertised event in Shanghai to attract Chinese investment into a two-tower luxury apartment complex in New Jersey, called One Journal Square, being developed jointly by Kushner Cos and KABR Group. The company later apologised for mentioning Jared Kushner\u2019s name while wooing investors. \nThe developers were seeking to raise $150 million, or 15.4 percent of funding for the project, from investors through the EB-5 visa program, according to marketing materials posted by the event\u2019s organizer, immigration agency Qiaowai, Reuters reported at the time. \nKushner Cos is not a publicly traded company but the EB-5 is considered a securities offering, the Journal said, hence the SEC\u2019s interest. \nKushner resigned from his role leading Kushner Cos when he was appointed Trump\u2019s senior White House adviser early last year but still owns a stake in parts of the business, according to his most recent personal financial disclosure form, the Journal said.

FILE PHOTO: The Ford Motor Company logo is pictured at the Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S., November 30, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo \nFord executives said they expect the F-150 diesel model with a 10-speed transmission to achieve 30 miles per gallon highway fuel efficiency, a level comparable to some midsize cars. \n\u201cWe\u2019re confident we\u2019ll get there,\u201d David Filipe, Ford vice president of powertrain engineering, said at a briefing for media ahead of the official launch announcement. \nThe diesel F-150 will cost between $2,400 and $4,000 more than a comparable gasoline truck, depending on the specific model, Ford executives said. The diesel engine will be manufactured at a Ford plant in Britain. \nFord executives said they expect that once production ramps up about 5 percent of F-150 models will be ordered with the diesel engine. The model will be aimed at people who tow large recreational or work trailers. \nSales of big pickup trucks in the United States have surged in recent years as gasoline prices have stabilized at less than $3 a gallon in most states. Ford in 2017 sold 896,764 F-series trucks, more than in any year since 2005. \nStill, Ford, General Motors Co ( GM.N ) and the Ram brand of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV ( FCAU.N ) ( FCHA.MI ) fight for the right to claim that their brands offer the most fuel-efficient large pickup - even when those high-mileage models have limited availability or cost more than conventional gasoline-fueled trucks. \nFiat Chrysler jarred its rivals in 2013 by offering a diesel engine in its light duty Ram pickup models and claiming best-in-class fuel economy. But last year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Justice Department charged that Fiat Chrysler improperly used software to cheat government emissions tests covering 104,000 Ram 2014-2016 models. \nThe automaker is negotiating to settle the complaints and received government clearance to offer a 3.0 liter diesel in its 2017 and 2018 Ram trucks. That model is rated at 27 miles per gallon in highway driving. \nFord executives said they are confident their diesel will comply with U.S. emissions rules.

A pump jack is seen at sunrise near Bakersfield, California October 14, 2014. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo \nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were at $61.95 a barrel at 0151 GMT, 5 cents below their last close but not far off the $62.21 May 2015 high reached the previous day. \nBrent crude futures LCOc1 were at $68.03 a barrel, 4 cents below their last settlement, but not far off the $68.27 high from the day before, also the highest since May 2015. \nBeyond a brief intraday spike in May 2015, these were the highest price levels since December 2014, during the oil price downturn. \nTraders said political tensions in oil producing Iran were supporting prices. \n\u201cThe protests in Iran add more fuel to the already bullish oil market mood,\u201d said Norbert Ruecker, head of commodity research at Swiss Bank Julius Baer. \nOil prices have been supported by production cuts led by the Middle East dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and by Russia, which started in January last year and are set to last through 2018, as well as by strong economic growth and financial markets. [MKTS\/GLOB] \nThis has helped tighten markets.

Disruptions in the North Sea have been removed with the Forties Pipeline system having resumed full operations. U.S. oil production surpassed the 2015 highs in October and is set to climb to historic highs this year,\u201d he said. \nLukman Otunuga, analyst at futures brokerage FXTM, struck a similarly cautious tone. \n\u201cOil started the New Year on an incredibly bullish note ... in part due to ongoing tensions in Iran ...

The deal has helped to balance an oversupplied market and drain global stockpiles of crude oil.\nHedge funds and other money managers raised their long positions, or bets that crude prices will keep going up, to the highest levels in 2017, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission covering the week through Dec. 26. This financial positioning represents the biggest risk to oil prices in the near term, according to Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.\n\"Everybody that wants to be long is long, and so all that can be done now is that it can be sold,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Wednesday. \"And so we should see those net long positions unwind. That could present some downside risk.\"\nHowever, the market is now finely balanced, so supply disruptions such as last month's U.K. North Sea Forties pipeline outage can boost oil prices, he said. Geopolitical tensions such as the unrest rocking Iran this past week can also push up prices, according to Smith.\nOil prices rose to their highest levels since mid-2015 on Wednesday as the protests continued, even though analysts said there was little risk of a supply disruption from Iran , OPEC's third largest producer.\n@JKempEnergy: HEDGE FUND long positions in petroleum hit a record 1,329 million bbl in week to Dec 26\nWhile long positions have surged, short positions, or bets that prices will fall, have dropped to the lowest levels since February in recent weeks.\nThe last time short positions fell to these \"extreme\" lows , the oil market saw a more than 20 percent correction, said John LaForge, head of Real Asset Strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\"On the professional side, everyone's long.

This is the profit traders can earn when they roll their investment in crude oil futures, which expire every month, into contracts that expire at a later date.\nRight now, traders playing the roll yield are earning 5 percent to 10 percent on their investments, compared with a roughly 2.5 percent yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds .\n\"I think financial length is far more well-supported by the structure in the market,\" he told \"Squawk on the Street\" on Friday. \"So I think there is some vulnerability ... but I also think that you're not going to see any wholesale liquidation of financial length.\""}

This action has sparked talk of the multidecade bull run in bonds coming to an end, with what could be a negative impact on equities.\n\nAfter all, U.S. stocks closed modestly lower on Thursday as yields climbed. But equity strategist Matt Maley believes the best way to think about the Treasury market is not the degree to which rising rates will impact the stock market, but rather how rising interest rates will affect the amount of leverage \u2014 or debt to finance purchases \u2014 in the marketplace now. The Miller Tabak straegist explains why.\n\n\u2022 Everybody seems to be asking the question of whether higher interest rates will mean higher competition for stocks, but this is missing the point. The real issue is what impact higher rates have on leverage, as there's more leverage in the financial system than ever before as measured by total worldwide debt.\n\n\u2022 Furthermore, corporate firms' margin debt in the U.S. sits near all-time highs. As rates move higher, the cost of that leverage goes up, and eventually leverage will have to be unwound.\n\n\u2022 The kind of unwinding won't appear as it did during the financial crisis, but a meaningful move about 2.6 percent on the U.S. 10-year yield will likely cause a headwind for the stock market.

He emphasized EPA has made no decisions on whether the requirements should be lowered. \nCARB spokesman Stanley Young confirmed the discussion but declined to elaborate. Catanzaro did not respond to a request for comment. \nNHTSA has said it plans to issue its proposed changes, if any, for the 2022-25 model years by March 30.

Regulators could also propose changes for 2021. \nIn June, New York state\u2019s attorney general and 12 other top state law officials said they would mount a court challenge to any effort to roll back vehicle fuel rules. \nGloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co , Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG ( VOWG_p.DE ) and others, said the companies \u201cfully support conversations between all the relevant parties.\u201d Reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Diane Craft"}

Chinese officials say that concept is \u201crelative\u201d in an emerging economy. \nLike other Westerners, the French have long complained about China\u2019s rules for foreign investments and its demands for technology transfers and compulsory joint-ventures with local rivals. \nFrench carmakers Renault and Peugeot-Citroen in particular have had to set up partnerships with domestic companies but have had only limited success in gaining a slice of the world\u2019s biggest auto market. \nFrench officials hope the emergence of a prosperous Chinese middle-class will give French companies, which tend to specialise in consumer products, an edge over German rivals more focused on machinery and equipment. \nBut besides the usual race for market share, Macron\u2019s advisors say he will also defend a common European Union line for freer trade between the blocs, in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric. \nAs an economy minister in the previous Socialist government, Macron led the fight to toughen EU anti-dumping rules imports of cheap Chinese steel surged. In June, he also urged the Commission to build a system for screening investments in strategic sectors from outside the bloc, which drew criticism from Beijing. \n\u201cEven if on the surface the trip goes smoothly and faux-pas are avoided because the two presidents are smart and it\u2019s the first state visit, I think on substance each will firmly defend their own priorities,\u201d Alice Ekman of the Paris-based think tank IFRI told Reuters. \nA delegation of 50 company executives, from nuclear giants EDF and Areva, planemaker Airbus and hotels group Accor, as well as representatives of the French beef, pork and milk lobbies are expected to travel with Macron. \nAirbus is in talks to sell 100 or more jetliners to China during the visit, sources said. \nDEFINING FRANCE\u2018S ASIA POLICY \nThe trip will also be an opportunity for the 40-year-old president, who has mostly focused on Europe and its neighbourood since his election, to define his country\u2019s role in Asia. \nThe two countries are expected to discuss security issues such as North Korea, after Pyongyang agreed to hold talks with the South next week amid a standoff over its nuclear and missile programmes. \nFrench officials have touted the fight against climate change as another key issue for cooperation with China, now that Trump has announced he would pull out of the Paris climate accord signed in 2015. \nHistory and symbols will also feature on the trip, as they did with Trump and Putin, whom Macron received in grandiose settings such as the Champs-Elysees and the Palace of Versailles. Macron is expected to visit cultural landmarks such as the ancient Terracotta Army in the former capital of Xian and the Forbidden City in Beijing, the ancient home of China\u2019s emperors.

It is also rewarding to see our progress reflected in our recent stock price. Over $126 million of cannabis-related products have been sold in Nevada since adult use went into effect on July 1, 2017. People don't realize that Nevada had more sales than Colorado experienced in their first four months of adult-use cannabis. We anticipate a continued significant increase in demand for cannabis lab testing services in 2018. In addition, with recreational cannabis now legal in California, we continue to work with our previously announced joint venture partner to launch an independent testing lab in California during 2018 as we seek to replicate our successful Nevada operations in other legal jurisdictions.\"\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) before (i) other income (expense), (ii) interest income, (iii) interest expense, (iv) bad debts, (v) depreciation and amortization, (vi) impairment of securities available-for-sale costs, (vii) non-cash expenses relating to share based payments recognized under ASC Topic 718, (viii) gain on early extinguishment of debt, and (ix) equity in losses of unconsolidated entity.

That's $280 billion more than the previous high hit in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis that led to the Great Recession.\nUpdated numbers for the fourth quarter of 2017, which ended Dec. 31, should be released in mid-February.\nConsumer debt keeps climbing Category Quarterly change (from Q2 2017) Annual change (from Q3 2016) Total as of Q3 2017 Mortgage debt (+) $52 billion (+) $393 billion $8.74 trillion Home equity line of credit (-) $4 billion (-) $24 billion $448 billion Student loan debt (+) $13 billion (+) $78 billion $1.36 trillion Auto loan debt (+) $23 billion (+) $78 billion $1.21 trillion Credit card debt (+) $24 billion (+) $61 billion $808 billion Total debt (+) $116 billion (+) $605 billion $12.96 trillion Federal Reserve Bank of New York Nevertheless, U.S. consumers have continued racking up debt . An annual post-holiday survey by MagnifyMoney shows people who used credit cards for holiday purchases charged an average of $1,054, about 5 percent more than last year.\nAs consumers keep spending away on their credit cards \u2014 which typically come with interest rates starting at about 16 percent \u2014 the Federal Reserve is expected to have two or three quarter-point hikes this year to a key rate that affects consumer debt . It did so three times in 2017.\n\"Every time there is a Federal Reserve rate hike, that adds about $1.5 billion to our collective financing rates,\" Gonzalez said. \"That has to do with these delinquency rates rising. And when you factor in mortgages, student loans and auto loans, that becomes a scary picture.\"\nIf you are among those facing mounting credit card bills, Gonzalez offers the following tips to pare down your debt:\nConsider transferring your balance If your credit score is high enough to qualify for a zero percent balance-transfer offer, consider taking it.\n\"The offers with 18 or 21 months with zero percent interest are reserved for those with excellent credit,\" Gonzalez said.\nWhile these deals typically come with a balance-transfer fee, the zero percent interest rate can last anywhere from a few months or a year to a couple of years. At the end of the deal, the remaining balance begins accruing interest at the then-current rate.\nNot only do you avoid paying interest on the debt, you can potentially pay it down more quickly because all of your payment will go toward the balance instead of some going toward interest.\nPhoto by Joe Raedle\/Getty Images Strategize your repayment efforts If you have multiple credit cards, start by funneling most of your repayments toward the one with the highest interest rate. In other words, pay the minimum on the lower-rate cards and put any extra you possibly can toward the debt that's costing you the most in interest.\n\"Once that most expensive debt is paid off, go to the card with the next highest rate and do that until you are debt free,\" Gonzalez said.\n\"On the Money\" airs on CNBC Saturdays at 5:30 a.m. ET.

Spot gold fell 0.4 percent to $1,312.35 an ounce at 0257 GMT. The precious metal earlier hit $1,321.33, its highest level since Sept. 15. U.S. gold futures were mostly unchanged at $1,315.60 an ounce. \"Relative strength index shows the metal at overbought levels, which may lead to short term selling,\" ScotiaMocatta analysts said in a research note. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) for spot gold touched 75 on Tuesday, it highest since September 2017. An RSI above 70 indicates a commodity is overbought and could lead to a price correction. The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.1 percent at 91.964 after falling to a more than three-month low Tuesday. The dollar posted its biggest annual drop since 2003 in 2017, helping gold to an annual increase of more than 13 percent. Bullion surged $55 an ounce in the last three weeks of 2017 alone. Gold's medium-term outlook appeared positive, analysts said. \"At this moment we are expecting some kind of inflationary expectations. People are more optimistic with stock rally are also expecting returns in commodities including gold,\" said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong's Wing Fung Financial Group. \"We should tap the short term opportunities to go long as gold has crossed $1,300 with a momentum. It may act as a support, while $1,340 could be an immediate resistance level and we might reach $1,400 in the first quarter this year.\" Spot gold may break a resistance at $1,326 per ounce and rise towards the next resistance at $1,380 in three months, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Later on Wednesday, investors will turn their attention to the minutes of the Federal Reserve's December policy meeting, when it raised interest rates for the third time in 2017. Further cues are likely from U.S. economic data this week, including jobs figures on Friday. Among other precious metals, spot palladium fell 0.1 percent to $1,090.80 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Tuesday at $1,096.50 The metal, which soared 57 percent in 2017, has been surging on fears of short supplies. Analysts expect that about 80 percent of global palladium demand will come from autocatalysts for gasoline-powered cars, which many consumers now prefer over diesel-fuelled vehicles. Spot silver fell 0.8 percent to $17.05 an ounce, after hitting a six-week high at $17.21 earlier in the session. Spot platinum fell 0.8 percent to $936.10 an ounce.

Instead, smaller contracts or commitments to go on talking were signed. \nBNP Paribas was set to announce plans for a joint-venture on consumer credit, a French official in Beijing said, adding that French nuclear group Areva had \u201cnever been so close\u201d to signing a contract to build a nuclear waste reprocessing plant in China. \n\u201cWe have an access to markets which is unbalanced, unsatisfying,\u201d Macron told members of the French and Chinese business community at a start-up incubator in Beijing. \n\u201cIf we don\u2019t deal with this responsibly, the first, natural, reaction will be to close up on both sides.\u201d \nIn his short time in office, 40-year-old Macron has managed to push through reforms to France\u2019s labor market and seen a steady rise in business and consumer confidence. Growth forecasts for 2018 have been upgraded. \nMacron has emerged as arguably the strongest voice in Europe, in the absence of either German and British leadership, with Chancellor Angela Merkel bogged down in coalition negotiations and Prime Minister Theresa May swamped by Brexit. \nSoon after arriving in China, the French president declared that \u201cEurope is back\u201d, announcing he intended to visit China every year of his five-year presidency. OPEN ON BOTH ENDS \nBut while the rhetoric has been strong, and TV commentary suggests Macron and his glamorous 64-year-old wife Brigitte have been a big hit with the Chinese, the underlying success of state visits is often measured in the size of business contracts. \nPlanemaker Airbus was in talks to sell 100 or more jetliners to China, officials familiar with the talks said last week. French President Emmanuel Macron speaks at a France-Chinese forum on the applications of artificial intelligence at SOHO 3Q in Beijing, China January 9, 2018. REUTERS\/Jason Lee \nBut after an official contract signing ceremony on Tuesday, it appeared that an Airbus deal had not been clinched. That would be a significant setback for Macron and Europe, although it is possible details will be finalised in the weeks ahead. \nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to China last year coincided with an announcement by Boeing Co that it had sold 300 aircraft to China. \nWithout a big dollar figure attached to the visit, Macron appeared to have fallen short, although French officials said China had asked them not to put a figure on any commercial and industrial deals they did strike. \nJack Ma, founder and executive chairman of online retailer Alibaba, gave Macron\u2019s pitch for more openness his backing on Tuesday, but added both sides had a part to play. Slideshow (8 Images) \n\u201cI think he\u2019s right, China should open more, China is opening more,\u201d he told reporters on the sidelines of a business forum in Beijing. \n\u201cFrance should open more, China should open more,\u201d he added. \nForeign businesses in China though have grown more pessimistic about Beijing\u2019s market restrictions even though government officials have repeatedly pledged to increase access. These businesses have also chafed at government policies they see as intended to assimilate and supplant foreign technology. \n\u201cWe welcome France to expand investment in China and exports of high-grade French products, and we hope the French side will further loosen exports of high-tech products to China,\u201d China\u2019s Premier Li Keqiang told Macron, according to a Chinese government statement. \nMacron, who met President Xi Jinping on Monday, said the two countries would fall into a lose-lose situation if continued restrictions on foreign firms in China prompted France and Europe to put a brake on Chinese investment in Europe. \n\u201cLet\u2019s open up both instead,\u201d said Macron, whose government has at the same time called for greater scrutiny of Chinese investment in Europe, particularly in sensitive sectors, concerned about protecting French interests and security. \nThe two presidents met again on Tuesday at Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People, and oversaw the signing of bilateral agreements, including the framework deals for Airbus and Areva in China. \nChinese online retail giant JD.com agreed to sell 2 billion euros worth of French products - such as Remy Martin cognac or Evian water - on its website over the next two years. JD.com also signed a deal to buy 100 million euros of machinery from French engineering firm Fives.

The House on Thursday passed a measure that would continue funding the government for another month, but opposition from Senate Democrats and some Republicans make it unlikely that such a measure can pass.\nMarc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said that President Donald Trump has been making phone calls in a bid to avert a shutdown, and that he hopes the government doesn't close.\n\"The president stands ready to sign a bill\" that will fund the government, Short told reporters during a briefing Friday.\nIf a shutdown happens, it will come just as Trump is marking his first full year in office. The president is planning to stick around Washington until the Senate passes a stopgap spending measure. Trump was slated to travel to his private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where he plans to attend a big-money fundraiser celebrating the first anniversary of his inauguration . The White House later said he would not go to Florida on Friday as originally planned.\nIn the breifing, both Mulvaney and Short tried to preemptively put the blame for a possible shutdown on Democrats. Asked about whether Trump rejecting a bipartisan immigration deal and reportedly calling certain nations \"s---hole\" countries set back funding talks, Mulvaney argued that \"there's no way\" Trump should take the blame for a shutdown.\nHe said Trump is \"actively working\" to strike a funding deal and contended that President Barack Obama did not do the same before a 2013 shutdown.\nNearly all Democrats have held out from supporting the GOP plan because they also want to pass a bill that would protect hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has sought to extend government funding for a few days in hopes of reaching an immigration agreement and longer-term spending deal.\nTrump and McConnell face some resistance within their own party in the Senate. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in an interview with MSNBC that he would not vote for a 30-day continuing resolution. He also said he was against a four-day deal.\nMulvaney cast doubts on lawmakers finding an immigration solution soon, saying the bipartisan lawmakers who presented a deal to Trump did not have legislative text for it.\nThe proposal also sought to meet Republican demands for increased border security funding and changes to extended family migration and the visa \"lottery\" system."}

Outstanding NCDs exceeded 8 trillion yuan last year, compared with around 3 trillion yuan at the end of 2015, according to Soochow Securities.\nNCDs are issued by banks and traded between financial institutions in the interbank market. China opened its NCD market in 2013 as a means to help liberalize the country\u2019s interest rate market.\nAlthough China has already tightened scrutiny on NCDs since then - the central bank will include them in its quarterly risk assessments this year targeting banks with assets of more than 500 billion yuan ($77.06 billion) - the new instructions point to a harsher stance as they now appear to target all banks.\n\u201cThe PBOC gave us guidance to follow the formula,\u201d said an official at a rural commercial lender with assets below 500 billion yuan. \u201cIf you don\u2019t follow, the annual issuance quota won\u2019t get approved.\u201d\nWindow guidance refers to informal instructions from regulators that are often communicated orally with no written notice.\nThe PBOC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the matter.\nThe latest restrictions could force smaller lenders that are heavily reliant on NCD funding to shrink their balance sheets and liquidate some of their investments, which could be potentially negative to asset prices.\nThe impact of the latest measures targeting NCDs is already being seen in small banks\u2019 fundraising plans.\nAccording a central bank website that tracks interbank data, Bank of Jilin has slashed its NCD issuance quotas by a third to 79 billion yuan this year. Bank of Guangzhou has cut its NCD quotas by a quarter, while the target by Bank of Suzhou slumped by 41 percent.\nReporting by Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch; Editing by Sam Holmes\n "}

Most of its assets, including its sister pages Deadspin, a sports site, and Jezebel, a feminist blog, were bought in 2016 for $135 million by media company Univision Holdings Inc . \nThiel has not said why he wants Gawker, though the potential acquisition would let him take down stories regarding his personal life that are still available on the website, and remove the scope for further litigation between him and Gawker. Thiel, who is Facebook Inc's first major investor and a co-founder of payment service PayPal Inc, did not respond to a request for comment. \nGawker's bankruptcy plan administrator Will Holden, of consulting firm Dacarba LLC, and the website's bankruptcy attorney Gregg Galardi, of law firm Ropes & Gray LLP, have tried to block Thiel's bid, according to court papers. \nGalardi in late November asked a U.S. bankruptcy court judge to deny Thiel's request to bid, according to court papers. He also argued Thiel is \"not a 'proper' purchaser\" because he could end up as the target of litigation, according to court papers. \nThiel funded former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker after the site published a sex tape featuring Hogan. The former wrestler, whose real name is Terry Bollea, won a $140 million judgment against the site, and later settled for $31 million. \nGawker in 2007 published a story about Thiel's homosexuality. \nMultiple bidders have submitted offers for the site, Holden said in a phone interview on Thursday. Holden will choose a winner as soon as this month, and then request approval for the deal from a U.S. bankruptcy court judge, the sources said. If Holden excludes Thiel's bid, Thiel could ask the judge to consider it if it is higher than rival offers. \nThe value of Thiel's bid could not be learned, though the sources said Gawker is only now worth a few million dollars. \nKevin Lee, the co-founder and executive chairman of Didit, a marketing firm, said he also submitted a bid, without disclosing its value. If successful, Lee said, he plans to use the site to raise money for readers' preferred charities. \nThe terms of the Univision sale restrict new articles from being published on Gawker until March 9. \nA group of former Gawker employees this week abandoned their effort to bid, one of the sources said. They had launched a campaign seeking $500,000 in donations through fundraising site Kickstarter, but failed to reach their goal and have returned the approximately $90,000 they did collect.

( tmsnrt.rs\/2hGom21 ) \nSignificantly, the U.S. drug tally of 46 does not include the first of a new wave of cell and gene therapies from Novartis, Gilead Sciences and Spark Therapeutics that were approved in 2017 under a separate category. \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has hailed these products as \u201ca whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases\u201d.

The fate of the remaining 31 sailors is not known. \nThe Sanchi tanker (IMO:9356608) run by Iran\u2019s top oil shipping operator, National Iranian Tanker Co, collided with the CF Crystal (IMO:9497050) on Saturday evening about 160 nautical miles off China\u2019s coast near Shanghai and the mouth of the Yangtze River Delta. \nChinese state media CCTV showed footage on Monday of a flotilla of boats dousing the flames with water as plumes of thick dark smoke continued to billow from the tanker. \nOne portion appeared to show the fire had been extinguished, although this could not be independently confirmed. China\u2019s Ministry of Transport and Maritime Safety would not comment when asked if the fire was out. \n\u201cThe Chinese government takes maritime accidents like this very seriously, and has already dispatched many search and rescue teams to the scene to carry out search and rescue,\u201d said the foreign ministry\u2019s Lu said. \nChina sent four rescue ships and three cleaning boats to the site, South Korea dispatched a ship and a helicopter, while a U.S. Navy military aircraft searched an area of about 3,600 square nautical miles (12,350 sq km) for crew members. \nThe Panama-registered tanker was sailing from Iran to South Korea, carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate, an ultra-light and highly volatile crude. That is equivalent to just under 1 million barrels, worth about $60 million, based on global crude oil prices. \nShip tracking data shows the collision occurred in waters not frequently used by large vessels like tankers, dry-bulk carriers or container ships. Most ships travel either closer to the Chinese coast in the west or more nearby to Japan in the east. \nThe freight ship, which was carrying U.S. grain, suffered limited damage and the 21 crew members, all Chinese nationals, were rescued. \nChina\u2019s transport ministry said the CF Crystal were being taken to the port of Luhuashan, just south of Shanghai, where authorities will start an investigation into the cause of the incident. \n(For a graphic on ship collision off China's coast click tmsnrt.rs\/2CBgqai ) \nCOLORLESS, ODORLESS AND HARMFUL Lu said it was too soon to discuss how victims of the disaster may be compensated, and that compensation and other questions would be addressed after an investigation into the accident is complete. \nBad weather made it hard for the rescue crews to get access to the tanker, but toxic gas from the burning oil posed a major risk. \nWhen condensate meets water, it evaporates quickly and can cause large-scale explosion as it reacts with air and turns into a flammable gas, the transportation ministry said on Monday. \nTrying to contain a spill of condensate, which is extremely low in density, highly toxic and much more explosive than normal crude oil, may be difficult. \nWhen liquid, most condensate is colorless and virtually odorless. Surface spills of condensate are therefore difficult to detect visually, making them hard to manage and contain. \nTankers also carry shipping fuel, known as bunker, which is extremely heavy and toxic when spilled, though much less explosive. \nThe Shanghai Maritime Bureau\u2019s navigation department said the collision did not affect traffic in and out of Shanghai, one of the world\u2019s busiest and biggest ports, or ports along the Yangtze river. \nA spokesman for South Korea\u2019s Hanwha Total Petrochemical Co Ltd [SMCHE.UL], which was due to receive the cargo, said it would use its own stockpiles to replace the lost cargo. \nReporting by Yuna Park and Jane Chung in SEOUL, Henning Gloystein in SINGAPORE, Meng Meng and Christian Shepherd in BEIJING; Writing by Brenda Goh in SHANGHAI and Josephine Mason in BEIJING; Editing by Richard Pullin and Christian Schmollinger\n "}

It wasn't even just about making hot sauce \u2014 she wanted to create something that would evoke the sights, sounds, flavors and smells of her youth, growing up in Harlem in the 1950s.\n\"The idea was from a memory,\" she tells CNBC Make It .\nA history not forgotten  Higginsen has had an interesting life so far: She was one of the first female advertising executives at Ebony magazine in the 70s , was a radio disc jockey across stations in New York for a decade , once published her own magazine about New York City, co-wrote a hit musical with her husband in 1983 and later started a non-profit, Mama Foundation for the Arts , which offers free music education in Jazz, R&B and gospel in Harlem, where both her husband and her daughter work with her.\nGetty Images | Afro Newspaper\/Gado Cicely Tyson and Vy Higginsen during a radio show, January 4, 1974. But some of her fondest memories are of growing up in a brownstone on 126th Street between Lenox and Seventh Avenues in New York City, busy streets only a block away from where the Harlem Whole Foods now stands. \n\"My family has been on this block for almost 100 years,\" Higginsen explains. She currently lives next door to the house she grew up in, which is still owned by her family.\nHer father was a Pentecostal minister and her mother was entrepreneur who operated the family's home as a rooming house. That meant a variety of guests were always coming and going, Higginsen recalls.\n\"There were people who came from all walks of life,\" she says. \"There were people who came from the South, they came from the Caribbean and they came from India.\"\nSince the brownstone only had one kitchen, the guests would take turns making their favorite dishes. Higginsen can still remember what it was like to have all of those flavors and aromas mixing under one roof.\n\"My house was always full of these incredible smells and tastes,\" she says.\n\"Then, after the food was cooked everyone would eat and then they would sing. So my life was full of good food and good music.\"\nMichael Ochs Archives | Getty Images 'Godfather of Soul' James Brown performs with The Famous Flames at the Apollo Theater in 1964 in New York, New York. The music of Harlem also streams through her memories, from singing hymns at her father's church on Lenox Avenue and 131st Street, to seeing iconic performers like James Brown at the Apollo Theater in her teenage years.\n\"The church was around the corner, the music was gospel,\" she says. \"As I got older the clubs were on Lenox Avenue and that was Jazz. The Apollo had the R&B, there was a radio station on the corner of 126th Street, there was Sylvia's around the corner,\" referring to Sylvia's Restaurant , a famous soul food eatery that opened in 1962.\nGetty Images | Buyenlarge Sylvia's restaurant in Harlem \"People would sing on the street corners under the lamplight singing Doo-Wop. Life was colored by music,\" Higginsen recalls.\nIt was these memories that inspired Mama's One Sauce.\nAbout two years ago, while reminiscing about the old days with friends Kevin and Felicia Lewis, whose son studied in the music program at The Mama Foundation, Higginsen had the idea to create a hot sauce. She knew it was the perfect thing to bring to life her eclectic memories.\n\"My partners and I began to put together the smells and the tastes and the feelings of my childhood and that is how it all came around,\" she tells CNBC Make It, referring to the Lewises. \nThe trio tinkered with ingredients and flavors until they found the right recipe, which drew on the Caribbean, southern and south Asian flavors she remembered. When they cooked it for friends and family, the positive reactions made them realize the sauce might be something worth selling.\n\"We had the product and we didn't know what to do with it,\" Higginsen explains. \"People would say, 'I want some, I like how it tastes,'\" but she didn't know where to sell it or how to scale.\nThen Higginsen learned about an opportunity right in her neighborhood.\nBig changes for small business In the spring of 2016, Higginsen sat down to lunch with Nikoa Evans-Hendricks, a long-time friend. Evans-Hendricks is a co-founder and executive director of Harlem Park to Park , an organization that supports small business and entrepreneurs in the area.\n\"I've known Vy for years. She is a legend in Harlem,\" Evans-Hendricks tells CNBC Make It. \"One day she mentioned to me that she had this sauce.\"\nAs a solution to help turn Higginsen's passion project into a business, Evans-Hendricks brought up an initiative she'd launched in the fall of 2015, the Harlem Local Vendor Program. \nCourtesy of Nikoa Evans-Hendricks The program is a coordinated effort between community organizations like Evans-Hendricks' and giant forces like Whole Foods and Columbia University . The goal of the program is to get the products of Harlem entrepreneurs \u2014 who are increasingly challenged by the neighborhood's gentrification and rising costs \u2014 onto the shelves of big retailers. \n\"Commercial rents have gotten so expensive in Harlem that now, to start your own business, it is really impossible for a small, independent operator to lease a space and open a store to sell their wares,\" Evans-Hendricks explains.\nThe average per-square-foot cost for commercial rents in Harlem has seen a 91 percent increase from 2005 to the spring of 2017, according to a survey by the Real Estate Board Of New York. And Harlem has seen a flurry of new restaurants and bars opening in recent years, like celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson's Red Rooster in 2010. Not to mention the opening of chains like Whole Foods.\nWhile the the introduction of Whole Foods might seem perilous to small food and beverage entrepreneurs, the upscale grocer's plans to open a store in Harlem didn't worry Evans-Hendricks when she first heard in 2012. In fact, she saw it as an exciting opportunity. \n\"The reality is you can't stop big box store development,\" she says. So the question became, \"If it is coming, how do I ensure that Harlem small business and Harlem small entrepreneurs benefit from it?\"\nShe called up Whole Foods' corporate office and proposed the company get involved in the area through Harlem Park to Park's Harlem Harvest Festival , an outdoor event coordinated by the non-profit where local businesses gather to sell food and products.\nGetty Images | Don Emmert\/AFP Whole Foods' Harlem location \"They were really open to that idea,\" she says.

The company said it will make a $350 billion \u201ccontribution to the economy, while promising to create 20,000 new jobs and open a new campus. Apple did not provide details on specific investment or plans to boost compensation for current employees. \nProponents of the recent tax reform law, which cuts the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, argue that a significant portion of those savings will flow to workers in the form of higher wages. The Trump administration has estimated that the average American worker could see their annual wages grow by $4,000 as a result of the drop in corporate taxes. \nSo far, however, those pay increases have been few and far between. With a few exceptions, companies that have announced specific plans are offering one-time bonuses in place of permanent wage increases. \nOf the 100 biggest companies by market capitalization on Jan. 4, roughly half did not respond to CNBC\u2019s multiple requests for comment on the impact on the tax bill on their plans for investment or worker\u2019s paychecks. \nAnother 21 responded but had no comment. The same number responded with general comments that did not include specific details on investment or worker compensation. \nOnly 9 companies in the S&P 100 contacted by CNBC said they have specific plans to use some of the money saved from the corporate tax cuts to boost worker pay or invest in facilities or charitable causes. \nAmong those with detailed announcements: AT&T last month said it plans to invest an additional $1 billion in the United States this year and pay a special $1,000 bonus to more than 200,000 AT&T U.S. employees. Walmart will raise its starting minimum wage to $11 an hour and award worker bonuses of between $200 and $1000 depending on years of service. Comcast , the parent company of CNBC, said it will award a special $1,000 bonus to more than 100,000 workers. Boeing last month announced plans to invest an additional $300 million as a result of the new tax law. Wells Fargo said it will raise its minimum hourly pay rate to $15 and target $400 million in 2018 for philanthropic contributions. Bank of America last month said U.S. employees making up to $150,000 per year \u2013 or about 145,000 workers \u2013 would get a get a one-time year-end bonus of $1,000. PNC Financial said it would give a $1,000 bonus to about 47,500 workers. U.S. Bancorp said it will pay a one-time, $1,000 bonus for nearly 60,000 employees; raise the minimum wage to $15 for all hourly employees; make a one-time, $150 million contribution to the U.S. Bank Foundation, and make enhancements to employees\u2019 health care offerings effective for the 2019 enrollment period. \nSome of the companies contacted by CNBC, including Goldman Sachs , Verizon , Walgreens and Intel , said they are analyzing the impact of the tax changes and may make announcements in the months ahead. A few said they planned to provide details on upcoming earnings calls. \nDozens of other large companies have also announced specific plans to pay bonuses. But collectively, they represent a tiny portion of the American workforce. \nIt\u2019s also unclear how smaller employers will deploy any savings from the new tax law. Roughly half of all American workers are employed by companies with payrolls of fewer than 500 workers, according to the Small Business Administration. \nProponents of the tax law argue that lower taxes will help smaller companies boost wages as they compete to hire workers in a tight labor market. Yet some economists, including Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors, doubt that most small businesses will see a big enough windfall to pass those savings along to workers. \n\u201cThat means the bonus and minimum wage announcements make for good PR, but not necessarily strong income gains for workers,\u201d he said. \nCNBC will update this survey as additional companies respond."}

Slideshow (3 Images) \nDudley said the council had invested heavily in support services to help those in need with shelters and emergency accommodation for rough sleepers, adding there was evidence that many of those begging were not in fact homeless. \n\u201cObviously, the level of tourist interest is set to multiply with the Royal Wedding in May 2018,\u201d he wrote, calling for the police to invoke powers such as the 1824 Vagrancy Act to clear the streets. \u201cThe whole situation also presents a beautiful town in a sadly unfavourable light.\u201d \nStansfield said he was surprised the letter had been publicly released, but added the police would be happy to investigate Dudley\u2019s concerns. \nThe Windsor Homelessness Project\u2019s manager Murphy James told the BBC it was \u201csickening\u201d Dudley had cited the royal wedding as a reason for concern. \n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely abhorrent that anybody has got these views in this day and age, especially a lead councillor of the borough,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody is sleeping out on the street, they are not there by choice, they are there because something has gone wrong.\u201d Editing by Stephen Addison"}

The revised opinion could spark years of litigation in the world's biggest soy exporter. \n\"Any court ruling suspending royalty payments can be appealed by Monsanto,\" Amaral said. He declined to estimate how long it would take for a final lower court ruling on the patent. \nSidney Pereira de Souza Junior, the lawyer representing the Mato Grosso soy growers association Aprosoja, said the case \"is moving fast,\" and a decision could come in two years. He said that after Monsanto presents its defense, the court could issue an injunction ordering it to suspend collection of Intacta royalties while the case is being deliberated. \nAmaral said that after a 10-year patent approval process it seemed \"surprising\" INPI would reverse its finding in a few weeks, based on the opinions of officials who did not participate in the original review. \nINPI said in a statement it had given its technical opinion in the case on the basis of Aprosoja's arguments, and that Monsanto had not presented counter-arguments before the court. \nIntellectual property rights are crucial to Monsanto, which also faces regulatory hurdles to gain approval for its takeover by Bayer AG, a $63.5 billion deal that would create the world's largest pesticides and seeds company. \nMonsanto's shares have been trading at a big discount to Bayer's offer price of $128 as investors worry about antitrust reviews around the world, including in Brazil, Monsanto's second-biggest market. \nAbout 96.5 percent of planted soy area in Brazil is occupied by genetically engineered beans. \nGlobal demand for transgenic seeds including soybean and corn is expected to rise to $36.5 billion in 2021 from $21.5 billion in 2015, according Zion Research. \nIntacta is genetically engineered to tolerate the herbicide glyphosate and to resist caterpillars. Monsanto has been collecting royalties on the seed since 2012, and its patent protection extends through 2022. (Reporting by Ana Mano; Editing by David Gregorio)"}

At least 21 people have been killed in the unrest surrounding the protests.\nThe official news website of the Iranian parliament, icana.ir, Quote: d Mahmoud Sadeghi of Tehran as saying that different security and intelligence forces detained the protesters, making it difficult to know the exact number of detainees. He did not elaborate, nor did he say where he got the figure.\nPreviously, authorities have said \"hundreds\" were arrested in Tehran alone, not offering a total figure for arrests as the demonstrations spread into the Iranian countryside, including small towns.\nInterior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli has said about 42,000 people at most took part in the anti-government protests. Sadeghi's figure of arrested offered Tuesday would mean nearly 10 percent of those who demonstrated were arrested.\nshow chapters US must be careful not to become the story as Iranian people speak out: Former undersecretary of State 8:39 AM ET Thu, 4 Jan 2018 | 01:42 On Sunday, Tehran prosecutor, Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, said that 70 of the detained protesters have been released on bail during the last 48 hours. He added that there would be more releases from detention, except for the main instigators of the riots who will be \"dealt with seriously.\"\nAlso Sunday, Iranian lawmakers held a closed session in which senior security officials briefed them on the protests and the conditions of the detainees, the state-run IRNA news agency reported.\nIranian authorities have said that the protests are waning. That's in part due to the government blocking access to the popular messaging app Telegram, which demonstrators used to share images of the rallies and organize. Authorities also have deployed additional police and members of the Basij, a volunteer organization affiliated with Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.\nIt remains difficult for journalists and outsiders to piece together what's happening beyond Tehran, as Iran is a vast country of 80 million and travel there is restricted.\nIn recent days, government supporters have held several mass rallies across the country to protest the unrest.\nshow chapters Iran protests will not go away: Control Risks 3:31 AM ET Thu, 4 Jan 2018 | 02:22 The United States and Israel have expressed support for the protests, which began on Dec. 28 in Iran's second largest city, Mashhad, but deny Iranian government allegations that they fomented them.\nU.S. officials and analysts studying Iran say believe conservative opponents of President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate within Iran's clerically overseen government, started the demonstrations in Mashhad, but quickly lost control of them.\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday also blamed \"Americans and Zionists\" for the protests, saying money supporting them came from \"one of the filthy-rich governments of the Persian Gulf.\"\nKhamenei, however, also stressed that those with legitimate complaints about Iran's economy should be heard.\n\"We should differentiate between people's righteous and honest demands on one side and barbaric and disruptive moves by another group,\" he said. \"These should be distinguished from each other.\""}

Soccer Football - Premier League - Tottenham Hotspur vs Everton - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - January 13, 2018 Everton manager Sam Allardyce Action Images via Reuters\/Matthew Childs \nGoals by midfielders Son Heung-min and Christian Eriksen on either side of a Harry Kane double handed ninth-placed Everton their third league defeat in a row. \nAllardyce suggested after the match that lessons had not been learnt from Everton\u2019s 2-1 FA Cup defeat by Liverpool last week, a game that was settled by Virgil van Dijk\u2019s late header. \n\u201cMaybe I have to take the responsibility for playing too many attack-minded players... I should have gone back to being a bit more boring,\u201d Allardyce said. \n\u201dI reverted back to our Liverpool performance and thought if the team can play like that... surely you can come to Tottenham and deliver the same performance and maybe get a result. \n\u201cIt was a shock second-half performance. I saw some good signs of the players last week against Liverpool and I saw some of the worst signs in the second half today which is massively worrying... Obviously it\u2019s something I have to address now.\u201d \nEverton take on relegation-threatened West Bromwich Albion in the league next weekend. The Baggies secured their first top-flight win in 21 games with a 2-0 result against Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday. \n\u201cWest Brom becomes a massive game next week so we don\u2019t get dragged back into that relegation zone. After having a wonderful start we\u2019re back in the danger zone. It\u2019s our responsibility to get results and stay away from that,\u201d Allardyce said. Editing by Christian Radnedge"}

That's the highest representation for any other region that bid for Amazon's \"HQ2.\" \nThe three regions \u2014 Washington, northern Virginia and Maryland's Montgomery County \u2014 are among the 20 finalists for HQ2, which Amazon promises will bring 50,000 high-paying jobs and $5 billion in additional investments. Other cities on the final list include New York, Los Angeles and Boston. \nAmazon didn't share many details about its criteria for narrowing the list from 238 bids. The company previously said it was looking at metropolitan areas with 1 million people and a stable, business-friendly environment. 'Amazon University' \nThere are many reasons for Amazon to choose the Washington, D.C., area over others. \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos already owns The Washington Post, and he recently purchased the largest home in D.C. Amazon's cloud service AWS also has a huge data center presence in the northern Virginia region. \nIt's unclear exactly what type of incentives the region has offered to Amazon for HQ2. But public records of the District of Columbia's proposal, discovered by WAMU , give some hints of what to expect. \nAlthough heavily redacted, the proposal offers relocation reimbursements of up to $5,000 for each employee relocating to D.C. and wage reimbursements of up to $10,000 for each new hire. It also promises a zero percent corporate tax rate for five years and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 9 percent to 6 percent \"for the life of the company.\" It also offered several property- and sales-tax exemptions. \nPerhaps the more unique offering is a new education and training center called \"Amazon University.\" The proposal says the new facility will offer \"customized educational curriculum for bachelors, masters, and executive education\" for Amazon at \"DC government's expense.\" It also offered to partner with local universities for a new program tailored for Amazon's workforce. \nIn response to making the final list, Washington D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser said in a statement, \"When asked what's the best city for one of the fastest-growing companies, we answered: #ObviouslyDC. Making this list reaffirms what we already knew going into the bid process \u2013 Washington, DC is no longer a one-company government town, we are a leader in innovation and tech, brimming with top talent and endless opportunity.\" D.C. has a slight advantage \nA recent analysis by CNBC picked the D.C. region as one of the top three picks, largely due to the business-friendly regulations in Virginia and a deep pool of talent. Coding bootcamp Thinkful also picked Washington, D.C., as the most likely choice for HQ2 based on its own analysis . \nAnd in a note published in October , Baird Equity Research's Colin Sebastian mentioned the nation's capital as a leading candidate, pointing out how Amazon had the largest number of job openings in Washington, D.C., outside Seattle and San Francisco. \n\"With a fairly large airport hub (Dulles), geographic diversity (East Coast\/Southeast), a large number of employees (in particular Amazon Web Services), and perhaps the side-benefit for Jeff Bezos given the nearby Washington Post, we would give a slight advantage to the DC metropolitan area,\" Sebastian wrote in the note. \nAmazon expects to make a final decision this year.

But the person with the most to lose is President Hassan Rouhani. Opponents of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani hold a protest outside the Iranian embassy in Rome, Italy, January 2, 2018. REUTERS\/Tony Gentile. \nWhile several senior officials said there was concern that prolonged unrest would damage the legitimacy and influence of the country\u2019s religious leaders, few insiders see the unrest as an existential threat to that leadership, which has ruled since the 1979 revolution and is now controlled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the ultimate authority in Iran\u2019s system of dual clerical and republican rule. \nThe biggest loser, they say, is likely to be Rouhani, who is much more closely tied to the country\u2019s economic policies. \n\u201cOf course Rouhani and his government will have less power afterwards, especially because his economic policy was criticized during the unrest,\u201d said political analyst Hamid Farahvashian. \n\u201cHe will be a lame-duck president and Khamenei will have more power.\u201d \nMuch of the protesters\u2019 anger has focused on what Rouhani and his government have failed to deliver: an economic boom promised as the payoff for the 2015 deal that curbed Iran\u2019s disputed nuclear programme in return for world powers lifting sanctions. \nProtesters are angry that Iran\u2019s youth unemployment rate is edging towards 30 percent, want higher wages and an end to alleged graft. They have chanted slogans against all of Iran\u2019s leaders, including the clerical elite, and attacked police vehicles, banks and mosques as the unrest widened. \n\u201cThe continuation of the protests will lead to a legitimacy crisis,\u201d said one senior official close to Rouhani, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. \n\u201cPeople have economic demands ... of course these demands should be taken seriously ... of course the establishment should listen to the people, but all these can be discussed in a calm atmosphere,\u201d the official said. \nSome conservatives have pushed for a hardline approach, even though bloodshed could fuel more protests in the largest wave of demonstrations since nationwide unrest in 2009. \n\u201cSo far, security forces have not tried to prevent the demonstrations .... but this will change if (Khamenei) calls for an end to the street protests and demonstrators defy his call,\u201d said one former Iranian official from the reformist camp. \nEven if the unrest is quelled, the demands of tens of thousands of restless working class youths who have taken to the streets are unlikely to dissipate. \nKhamenei spoke publicly for the first time about the crisis on Tuesday, accusing Iran\u2019s enemies of stirring unrest but saying no more. A statement on his website said he would address the nation about the events \u201cwhen the time is right\u201d. \nTHE LIMITS OF ROUHANI\u2018S POWER \nThe protesters have little chance of toppling the clerical leaders, who appear to be retaining control of the military, police, and security forces and have no compunction about using them, according to one U.S. official following the developments. \nRouhani, who was elected in 2013, is more exposed. He is seen as a pragmatist at odds with Iran\u2019s hardliners and has said in response to the protests that Iranians have a right to criticise the authorities. \nBut he has a fight on his hands because of growing resentment over high prices and allegations of corruption. \n\u201cHis power is limited in Iran\u2019s ruling system. Public discontent is increasing ... people are losing their faith in the establishment system,\u201d a third Iranian official said. \u201cThe leaders are well aware of this fact and its dangerous consequences.\u201d \nU.S. officials fear the likeliest outcome of the protests is discrediting what one called Rouhani\u2019s \u201cmoderate brand of moderation\u201d and a harsher crackdown by the clerical authorities. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an open question whether Rouhani ever intended to keep any of his promises, but he hasn\u2019t delivered, especially on the economic front, and that means he has no popular support and is expendable to Khamenei,\u201d said a second U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. \n\u201cHe\u2019s likely to be one of the casualties, though maybe not immediately.\u201d \nRouhani has blamed his predecessor and the United States, Iran\u2019s long-time adversary, for the economy\u2019s shortcomings. \nBut his government has also backtracked on planned fuel price rises and promised more jobs. \nRouhani may need to spend more money to create more employment if he is to ease discontent, and could risk antagonising powerful interests if he tries to address allegations of corruption. \nHis vulnerability and the deep divisions in Iran\u2019s hierarchy have fuelled suspicions among some of his sympathizers that conservative rivals may have played a hand in the crisis. \n\u201cIt was a coup against Rouhani and his achievements ... The aim was to harm Rouhani,\u201d said Saeed Leylaz, a political analyst close to the pro-reform movement. \nBut a fourth official in Tehran said the nationwide protests had united Iran\u2019s leadership. \n\u201cAt this point it is not important whether a political faction initiated the unrest to harm the rival group,\u201d the official said. \n\u201cThe unrest was hijacked by our enemies ... that is why all factions have united to protect the Islamic Republic.\u201d Additional reporting by John Walcott in Washington and Andrew Torchia in Dubai; Writing by Michael Georgy; Editing by Nick Tattersall"}

The report highlights an internal letter to laid off workers that said the cuts were intended to \u201cto better align our resources with business requirements.\u201d \nThe layoffs highlight GoPro\u2019s ongoing struggle to turn itself around after a turbulent past few years in which its stock has plummeted 91% from a high of $93.70 in Aug 2014 to $7.52 on Friday. \nThe company has attempted to expand beyond its core video camera business by creating a media and entertainment unit and making drones. But those efforts have failed to catch on , and the company has implemented multiple rounds of layoffs and shuttered its media business. \nInvestors were particularly hopeful that GoPro\u2019s Karma drone would help lift sales, but the push encountered trouble from the get-go.

Although CEO Nick Woodman would say he was optimistic about the drone business, he avoided saying when he thought drone sales would eventually lift the company\u2019s overall sales. \nGoPro never released sales numbers for its drone, but the numbers are likely to be small compared to Chinese rival DJI, which analysts currently say dominates the drone market. \nFortune contacted GoPro for more information and will update this story if it responds.

When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,\u201d Trump said. \nTrump had relied heavily on Bannon, chairman of the right-wing Breitbart News website, for advice in the months leading up to his upset victory in the November 2016 election. \nBannon helped Trump shape a populist, anti-establishment message and has been the president\u2019s link to his conservative base of support. It was not clear if the split would push Bannon to be even more aggressive in his campaign against the Republican establishment and whether he would now also target Trump, or would emerge much weaker. \nAccording to excerpts from \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d by Michael Wolff, to be released on Tuesday, Bannon described a June 2016 meeting with a group of Russians at Trump Tower in New York as \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d The meeting was arranged by the president\u2019s son and attended by top Trump campaign officials. \nTrump has in the past praised Bannon for his friendship, but the president said in his statement on Wednesday Bannon had little to do with his election victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton, calling him \u201ca staffer who worked for me\u201d after he had already won the Republican nomination. \nThe president said Bannon was to blame for the loss of a Republican-held U.S. Senate seat in Alabama in December when Republican Roy Moore, whose campaign was derailed by accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, lost to Democrat Doug Jones. Trump and Bannon backed Moore in the campaign. \n\u201cNow that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn\u2019t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans,\u201d Trump said. \n\u2018NIGHTMARE OF BACKSTABBING, HARASSING\u2019 \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had been upset over Trump\u2019s backing of Moore at the urging of Bannon, was clearly pleased Trump was willing to rid himself of the former aide. McConnell\u2019s campaign organization posted on Twitter an image of the normally taciturn senator with a beaming smile. \nDonald Trump Jr. attacked Bannon in a tweet. \n\u201cSteve had the honor of working in the White House & serving the country. Unfortunately, he squandered that privilege & turned that opportunity into a nightmare of backstabbing, harassing, leaking, lying & undermining the President. Steve is not a strategist, he is an opportunist,\u201d he said. \nThe president, an expert at self-promotion, said Bannon was trying to promote himself by \u201cleaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was.\u201d FILE PHOTO:   talks to chief strategist Steve Bannon during a swearing in ceremony for senior staff at the White House in Washington, U.S. January 22, 2017. REUTERS\/Carlos Barria\/File Photo \n\u201cSteve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books,\u201d said Trump, who famously values loyalty in associates and employees. \nLawyers for the president sent a cease and desist letter to Bannon on Wednesday. They said in the letter, seen by Reuters, Bannon had breached an agreement by communicating with Wolff about Trump, his family members and the campaign and made disparaging remarks about Trump and his family. \nWith elections looming in November that could cost Republicans control of Congress, Trump praised Republican lawmakers and candidates, words likely to be welcomed by McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. \n\u201cLike me, they love the United States of America and are helping to finally take our country back and build it up, rather than simply seeking to burn it all down,\u201d Trump said. \n\u2018BRAIN TRUST\u2019 \nAs with much in the Trump White House, the story that triggered the harsh back-and-forth was an offshoot of the investigation into whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russia to sway the election to Trump, allegations Trump and Moscow deny. \nBannon expressed derision about the June 2016 meeting in which a Russian lawyer was said to have offered damaging information about Clinton, according to the book. \nThe meeting was attended by Trump\u2019s son, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Bannon was also quoted as saying he was sure Trump Jr. would have taken the Russians who took part in the meeting to meet his father in Trump Tower. \n\u201cThe three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers.

Mrs. Trump supported her husband\u2019s decision to run for President and in fact, encouraged him to do so. She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did.\u201d Reporting by Steve Holland; Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu, Jim Oliphant and Brendan O'Brien; Editing by Will Dunham, Peter Cooney and Paul Tait"}

But when you get past 80 minutes and the goal hasn\u2019t come, you fear the second match. But the team kept trying so I knew the goal could arrive.\u201d Slideshow (2 Images) \nUnited had missed a string of chances as Lingard hit the post with a fierce arrowed shot several minutes before he broke the deadlock and Marcus Rashford also found the woodwork with a glancing header in the opening half. \nCarson kept out an array of stinging long range efforts, including three from Paul Pogba as United struggled to find a way through a resolute and well-organized visiting defense. \nPinned back for much of the contest, Derby launched several dangerous raids as defender Marcus Olsson and midfielder Tom Lawrence came close for the Rams, who finally cracked in the closing stages. \nCarson was left clutching thin air as Lingard unleashed a swiveling shot into the top left corner from 18 meters and with Derby throwing caution to the wind, Lukaku raced clear to score his 16th goal for United in all competitions.

FILE PHOTO - The Federal Reserve Building stands in Washington April 3, 2012. REUTERS\/Joshua Roberts\/File Photo \nThe details of the meeting, at which the Fed raised interest rates for the fifth time since the 2008 financial crisis, also showed that officials have a similar lack of certainty over the impact of fiscal stimulus on raising price pressures. \n\u201cMost participants reiterated their support for continuing a gradual approach to raising the target range, noting that this approach helped to balance risks to the outlook for economic activity and inflation,\u201d the Fed said in the minutes. \nThey then mulled the dual possibilities that the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts or easy financial conditions could cause inflation pressures to build unduly, while at the same time also considering that actual or expected inflation may fail to rise to the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target. \nU.S. stocks were little changed following the publication of the minutes and U.S. Treasury yields were little changed. The U.S. dollar extended gains against a basket of currencies. \nThe inflation shortfall is set to dominate incoming Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s first few months as chief of the central bank with further rate increases more difficult to justify without an upswing. He is set to take over from Janet Yellen by the time of the next rate-setting meeting on Jan. 31-Feb. 1. \n\u201cThey have been taking a middle-of-the road on their policy approach...if inflation picks up, they will go faster [on rate rises]. If things slow down, they will go slower,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities in Stamford, Connecticut. FED SEES FISCAL BOOST \nAt its December meeting, the Fed kept its forecast for three rate rises this year and in 2019 unchanged even as policymakers anticipated a short-term boost in U.S. economic growth from the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping $1.5 trillion tax overhaul signed into law on Dec. 22. \nThe tax changes reduce the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and temporarily cuts the taxes paid by most individuals as well. \nIn the minutes, many policymakers \u201cexpected the proposed cuts in personal taxes to provide some boost to consumer spending\u201d and many characterized the changes in business taxes as likely to provide a modest boost to capital spending. \n\u201cHowever, some business contacts...noted that the increase in cash flow that would result...was more likely to be used for mergers and acquisitions or for debt reduction and stock buybacks,\u201d the minutes said. \nIn December, the Fed forecast ultra-low unemployment of below 4 percent in 2018 and 2019, but still predicted inflation would remain below 2 percent at the end of 2018. \nThe mystery of low inflation in such a robust economy has prompted debate at the Fed for the past several months and was the concern of the two policymakers who voted against a rate increase at last month\u2019s meeting. \nThe latest minutes showed that while participants generally viewed inflation rising back to target over the medium term, several said \u201cother persistent factors may be holding down inflation.\u201d \nInvestors have all but ruled out an interest rate increase at the Fed\u2019s upcoming meeting but currently see another nudge upwards at the following one in March.

Despite having the right idea at the right time, the challenge of raising the necessary capital to execute impacted our ability to truly realize the potential from this disruptive opportunity.\nWe entered 2017 with $45.3 million in total liabilities and only $98 thousand in assets. Through capital raises and debt restructuring achievements during last year, we\u2019ve dramatically improved our financial position.\nTogether with other major accomplishments we believe we have positioned the company for what may be a brighter future. Over the course of 2017, we\u2019ve:\nRestructured our toxic convertible debt Raised $2.1 million through two rounds of equity financing (May and October) Began building our portfolio of digital assets Broadened our board directors with the appointment of Jonathan Read and David Garrity Eliminated all anti-dilution and investor friendly features from certain of our securities\nAs a result of the above efforts and accomplishments as of December 31, 2017 we had no debt and cash of approximately $303K and digital assets valued at $621K for an aggregate of $924K in total assets.\nWith respect to the merger with the Australian blockchain company, due to delays in receiving their audited financials and other due diligence items, the board unanimously decided to evaluate other potential merger targets. While it is still possible we may complete the merger with the Australian company, we are actively focused on other opportunities and in preliminary discussions with other potential targets that may drive shareholder value. We cannot assure you we will complete any acquisition.\nLastly, while recent SEC filings noted the intention of management and current employees to resign should the merger with the Australian company fail to materialize, we have agreed to remain onboard for a limited time to evaluate other potential directions for the company.\nOn behalf of our entire team, I want to again personally thank you for your continued support.\nSincerely,\nCharles Allen\nCEO and Chairman\nAbout BTCS:\nBTCS is an early entrant in the Digital Asset market and one of the first U.S. publicly traded companies to be involved with Digital Assets and blockchain technologies.

BTCS intends to acquire digital assets through open market purchases and may, subject to additional financing, acquire digital assets by resuming our transaction verification services business (often referred to as mining) through outsourced data centers and earning rewards in digital assets by securing their respective blockchains. Additionally, BTCS may participate in initial digital asset offerings (often referred to as initial coin offerings) but has yet to do so due to regulatory concerns and the risk that many digital assets are digital securities.

(\u201cHudbay\u201d or the \u201ccompany\u201d) (TSX:HBM) (NYSE:HBM) announced today that its wholly owned subsidiary, HudBay Peru S.A.C., has entered into the following agreements to acquire mining properties in southern Peru near its Constancia mine: (i) an option agreement with a private Peruvian consortium to earn a 100% interest in the Caballito (formerly Katanga) and Maria Reyna mining properties; and (ii) an agreement to acquire from Panoro Minerals Ltd. 100% of the Kusiorcco mining properties.\nThis map highlights the location of the acquired mining properties relative to Hudbay\u2019s Constancia mine and the Pampacancha deposit.\nThe Caballito property, located approximately three kilometers northwest of Constancia, is a 120-hectare (297-acre) concession block and is the site of the former Katanga mine, which was in intermittent copper oxide production from the early 1900s to the early 1990s.\nThe Maria Reyna property, located within ten kilometers of Constancia, is a 5,850-hectare (14,456-acre) concession block. Diamond drilling by a previous optionee of the Maria Reyna property resulted in a copper skarn-porphyry discovery. Geophysical surveys and geological mapping have also been conducted on the property and the area remains very prospective for additional discoveries.\nThe Kusiorcco property, located within seven kilometers of Constancia, is a 3,962-hectare (9,790-acre) concession block nearby the Caballito and Maria Reyna properties.\nHudbay is commencing permitting, community relations and technical activities required to access and conduct drilling activities on the concessions and expects to provide further details on its exploration plans for these properties in due course. These mineral properties are situated within the regional mineralization trend of the Andahuaylas-Yauri belt and provide Hudbay with a large, contiguous block of mineral rights to explore for mineable deposits within trucking distance of the Constancia processing facility.

{"published":"2018-01-01T10:01:00.000+02:00","title":"New year brings broad pot legalization to California","text":"LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The arrival of the new year in California brought with it broad legalization of marijuana, a much-anticipated change that comes two decades after the state was the first to allow pot for medical use.\nThe nation's most populous state joins a growing list of other states, and the nation's capital, where so-called recreational marijuana is permitted even though the federal government continues to classify pot as a controlled substance, like heroin and LSD.\nPot is now legal in California for adults 21 and older, and individuals can grow up to six plants and possess as much as an ounce of the drug.\nBut finding a retail outlet to buy non-medical pot in California won't be easy, at least initially. Only about 90 businesses received state licenses to open on New Year's Day. They are concentrated in San Diego, Santa Cruz, the San Francisco Bay Area and the Palm Springs area.\nLos Angeles and San Francisco are among the many cities where recreational pot will not be available right away because local regulations were not approved in time to start issuing city licenses needed to get state permits. Meanwhile, Fresno, Bakersfield and Riverside are among the communities that have adopted laws forbidding recreational marijuana sales.\nJust after midnight, some Californians were raising blunts instead of champagne glasses.\nJohnny Hernandez, a tattoo artist from Modesto, celebrated New Year's Eve by smoking \"Happy New Year blunts\" with his cousins.\n\"This is something we've all been waiting for,\" he said. \"It is something that can help so many people and there's no reason why we should not be sharing that.\"\nHernandez said he hoped the legalization of recreational marijuana would help alleviate the remaining stigma some still believe surrounds marijuana use.\n\"People might actually realize weed isn't bad. It helps a lot of people,\" he said.\nFor those who worked for this day, the shift also offered joyful relief.\n\"We're thrilled,\" said Khalil Moutawakkil, founder of KindPeoples, which grows and sells weed in Santa Cruz. \"We can talk about the good, the bad and the ugly of the specific regulations, but at the end of the day it's a giant step forward, and we'll have to work out the kinks as we go.\"\nBerkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin and state Sen. Nancy Skinner were on hand for a ribbon-cutting ceremony as his city began selling marijuana legally. Customers began lining up before dawn Monday outside Berkeley Patients Group, one of the oldest dispensaries in the nation. A big crowd also gathered at Harborside dispensary in nearby Oakland, where customers hoped to be among the first to buy legal pot in the state.\nLos Angeles officials announced late last month that the city will not begin accepting license applications until Jan. 3, and it might take weeks before any licenses are issued. That led to widespread concern that long-established businesses would have to shut down during the interim.\nHowever, attorneys advising a group of city dispensaries have concluded that those businesses can continue to legally sell medicinal marijuana as \"collectives,\" until they obtain local and state licenses under the new system, said Jerred Kiloh of the United Cannabis Business Association, an industry group.\nIt wasn't immediately clear how many of those shops, if any, would be open on Jan. 1.\n\"We are trying to continue to provide patient access,\" said Kiloh, who owns a dispensary in the city's San Fernando Valley area. With the new licensing system stalled in Los Angeles \"my patients are scared, my employees are scared.\"\nThe status of the Los Angeles shops highlights broad confusion over the new law.\nState regulators have said shops must have local and state licenses to open for business in the new year. But the city's top pot regulator, Cat Packer, told reporters last month that medicinal sales can continue to consumers with a doctor's recommendation until new licenses are issued.\nThe state banned \"loco-weed\" in 1913, according to a history by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, the pot advocacy group known as NORML. The first attempt to undo that by voter initiative in 1972 failed, but three years later felony possession of less than an ounce was downgraded to a misdemeanor.\nIn 1996, over the objections of law enforcement, President Clinton's drug czar and three former presidents, California voters approved marijuana for medicinal purposes. Twenty years later, voters approved legal recreational use and gave the state a year to write regulations for a legal market that would open in 2018.\nToday, 29 states have adopted medical marijuana laws. In 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize recreational marijuana. Since then, five more states have passed recreational marijuana laws, including Massachusetts, where retail sales are scheduled to begin in July.\nEven with other states as models, the next year is expected to be a bumpy one in California as more shops open and more stringent regulations take effect on the strains known as Sweet Skunk, Trainwreck and Russian Assassin.\nThe California Police Chiefs Association, which opposed the 2016 ballot measure, remains concerned about stoned drivers, the risk to young people and the cost of policing the new rules in addition to an existing black market.\n\"There's going to be a public-health cost and a public-safety cost enforcing these new laws and regulations,\" said Jonathan Feldman, a legislative advocate for the chiefs. \"It remains to be seen if this can balance itself out.\"\nAt first, pot shops will be able to sell marijuana harvested without full regulatory controls. But eventually, the state will require extensive testing for potency, pesticides and other contaminants. A program to track all pot from seed to sale will be phased in, along with other protections such as childproof containers.\nJamie Garzot, founder of the 530 Cannabis shop in Northern California's Shasta Lake, said she's concerned that when the current crop dries up, there will be a shortage of marijuana that meets state regulations. Her outlet happens to be close to some of California's most productive marijuana-growing areas, but most of the surrounding counties will not allow cultivation that could supply her.\n\"Playing in the gray market is not an option,\" Garzot said. \"California produces more cannabis than any state in the nation, but going forward, if it's not from a state-licensed source, I can't put it on my shelf. If I choose to do so, I run the risk of losing my license.\"\nIn 2016, the state produced an estimated 13.5 million pounds of pot, and 80 percent was illegally shipped out of state, according to a report prepared for the state by ERA Economics, an environmental and agricultural consulting firm. Of the remaining 20 percent, only a quarter was sold legally for medicinal purposes.\nThat robust black market is expected to continue to thrive, particularly as taxes and fees raise the cost of retail pot by as much as 70 percent.\nAssociated Press writers Christopher Weber, Michael R. Blood and Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.\nFollow AP's complete coverage of marijuana legalization in California: https:\/\/apnews.com\/tag\/CaliforniaMarijuana ."}

At 4 p.m. EST (2100 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading at C$1.2507 to the greenback, or 79.96 U.S. cents, up 0.6 percent from Friday's close. It traded between C$1.2500, its strongest level since Oct. 20, and C$1.2557 during the session. The currency rose nearly 7 percent in 2017. The loonie, as the Canadian currency is colloquially known, has gained steadily versus the greenback since mid-December as part of a broader U.S. dollar retreat, which one corporate trader said may be prompting Canadian exporters to trim their targets to the high C$1.20s from the low C$1.30s previously. It's put \"a significant seed of doubt in the minds of Canadian exporters,\" said Brad Schruder, director of corporate sales and structuring at BMO Capital Markets. He said Friday's Canadian employment report for December will be a key piece of data to help the Bank of Canada decide whether to hike rates in January or to wait for later in the year. Bets are slightly in favor of a hold-steady decision. The U.S. dollar retreated against a basket of major currencies as data showing a faster pace of euro zone manufacturing activity boosted the euro. The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, touched its highest intraday since mid-2015 amid large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia, before settling slightly lower. Still, speculators have cut bullish bets on the Canadian dollar to the lowest since July, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed on Friday. As of Dec. 26, net long positions had fallen to 17,346 contracts from 45,901 a week earlier. Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve, with the two-year down 3 Canadian cents to yield 1.703 percent and the benchmark 10-year falling 30 Canadian cents to yield 2.079 percent.

Trump and his aides were typically defiant, with his press secretary calling Democrats \"obstructionist losers, not legislators\" and saying there would be no immigration negotiations until the shutdown was lifted.\nThe White House and federal agencies spent Friday mapping out the government closure, with a goal of as little disruption as possible. Mail will continue to be delivered; airport control towers will be staffed; and the Interior Department hopes to keep the national parks open.\nHaving stumbled into a shutdown few seemed to want, lawmakers in both parties seemed eager to keep it brief. As the midnight deadline passed, Republican senators kept haggling with Democrats over a compromise that would re-open the government as soon as this weekend, with a new funding cutoff date of Feb. 8.\nSaturday Session But it was uncertain whether they could act that quickly. The Senate adjourned until noon on Saturday, and there could be a vote on the shorter funding window if Democrats agree. Any new legislation will require another vote in the House, which also will be in session on Saturday.\nFinancial markets shrugged off the shutdown drama in Washington. U.S. stocks rose to all-time highs after a report that regulators are close to further easing banking rules. All major equity indexes gained and the S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent to a record 2,810.31.\nThe House agreed on funding for the government through Feb. 16, but it got blocked in the Senate, despite leaving the vote open for a full two hours, in the face of mostly unified Democratic opposition. Four Republican Senators, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake, Rand Paul and Mike Lee, voted against moving forward with House bill, though for different reasons.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell voted \"no\" at the last minute as a procedural maneuver that would give him a chance to bring the measure up for a vote again.\n'Cynical Decision' \"What we've just witnessed on the floor was a cynical decision by Senate Democrats to shove aside millions of Americans for the sake of irresponsible political games,\" McConnell said after the voting was finished.\nBoth parties immediately began trying to tag the other with the blame, as competing hashtags showed up on Twitter: #TrumpShutdown and #SchumerShutdown, named for the top Senate Democrat, Charles Schumer of New York.\n\"Senate Democrats own the Schumer Shutdown,\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in her statement. \"We will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while Democrats hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands.\"\nDivisions Democrats want legislation to protect undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children and Republicans are setting conditions for border security and enforcement.\nSchumer said after the vote that when he met with Trump at the White House earlier Friday, they appeared to have reached the \"outline of a deal\" on issues including immigration and health care. Instead, he said, Trump folded when he got pushback from Republicans.\n\"He backed off at the first sign of pressure,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor.\nWhite House officials from Trump down had put on an optimistic front early in the day.\n\"Excellent preliminary meeting in Oval with @SenSchumer,\" the president wrote on Twitter, less than seven hours before the midnight deadline.\nThe White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney predicted Republicans and Democrats would strike an agreement before the weekend was out to provide temporary funding for the government that would let federal agencies open on schedule Monday.\n\"I think there's a deal in the next 24 hours,\" Mulvaney said on CNN.\nIf there's not, both sides were ready to place blame.\nBlaming Trump Schumer blamed the standoff on Trump's inability to set a clear path and the failure of Republican congressional leaders to deliver on immigration. He said the president is the \"single driving force in scuttling bipartisan deals in Congress.\"\nOne potential way out would be significant progress on immigration among congressional Democrats and Republicans and the White House. Members of Trump's administration, including Chief of Staff John Kelly and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, have been shuttling between meetings at the Capitol where members of both parties have been working on a getting a deal.\nDemocrats have been demanding that Congress act now to protect the young immigrants who are shielded under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which Trump plans to end on March 5. Republicans want to pair that issue with stronger border security and restrictions on other immigration programs.\nThe House earlier voted 230-197 largely along party lines to pass a bill that would have continued government financing at current levels until Feb. 16. It included a six-year extension of funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program and a delay in implementation of three taxes imposed by the Obama-era Affordable Care Act.\nRepresentative Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, said there's no mystery about what is needed to resolve the impasse, since these issues had been on the table since September.\n\"Leadership here is going to have to allow a vote on a bipartisan DACA bill \u2014 take the bull by the horns and do it,\" Dent said, using the acronym for the immigration program at the center of the standoff. \"Because we're not going to remove ourselves from this treadmill of continuing resolutions until we have a bipartisan budget agreement. And we will not have a bipartisan budget agreement until there is an agreement on DACA.\"\n"}

Scanpix Denmark\/Liselotte Sabroe via REUTERS \nAblynx rejected Novo\u2019s latest takeover approach and analysts predict the Danish group, whose new chief executive is trying to expand by buying drugs developed by competitors, might face counterbidders and would need to raise its bid. \nAblynx shares jumped 45 percent to 30.80 euros by 1520 GMT as trading resumed on Monday after the stock was initially suspended by Belgium\u2019s market regulator. \nNovo has offered up to 30.50 euros per share for Ablynx, which represents a 60 percent premium to the Belgian company\u2019s Dec. 6 share price, before its first approach. \nThe approach comes at a time of renewed interest by large drugmakers in smaller biotech firms, with U.S.-based Celgene ( CELG.O ) clinching a deal to buy Impact Biomedicines for up to $7 billion on Sunday and Japan\u2019s Takeda Pharmaceutical ( 4502.T ) agreeing last week to buy another Belgian biotech group TiGenix ( G9U.BR ) for $630 million. \nAblynx said in a statement that its board \u201cunanimously concluded that the proposal fundamentally undervalues Ablynx and its strong prospects for continued growth and value creation\u201d. \nThe Belgian group specialises in the research of novel drugs based on nano-bodies found in the immune systems of llamas and alpacas, for which it partners with several of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies. \nThe main attraction for Novo is Ablynx\u2019s experimental drug caplacizumab for the rare bleeding disorder acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which would complement Novo\u2019s line-up of blood products focused on haemophilia. \nThe $11 billion haemophilia market is facing upheaval and Novo stands to lose sales following approval of a new Roche ( ROG.S ) drug Hemlibra. \nBiopharmaceutical treatments, led by haemophilia, make up around 20 percent of Novo\u2019s sales, with diabetes and obesity products accounting for the remaining 80 percent. \n\u201cWe have solid growth in our diabetes and obesity business but we are struggling a little bit to maintain the same level of growth momentum in biopharma,\u201d Novo\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard said. NEW NOVO CEO ACTS \nThe Danish company said it would pay 28.00 euros per share in cash for Ablynx and an additional 2.50 euros in a so-called contingent value right (CVR) if certain conditions related to other drugs in Ablynx\u2019s research portfolio were met. \nAn acquisition would be the first by Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who took over a year ago. He has said the firm needs external innovation to broaden its product line-up. \nUnder previous chief executive Lars Rebien Sorensen, Novo sat out a spate of deal-making across the drugs industry and instead focused on its market-leading position making insulin and other diabetes treatments. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Danish multinational pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is pictured on the facade of a production plant in Chartres, north-central France, April 21, 2016. REUTERS\/Guillaume Souvant\/Pool\/File Photo \nBut in March, the company approached Global Blood Therapeutics ( GBT.O ), a U.S. biotech company focused on serious blood disorders, to discuss a potential takeover, people familiar with the situation said. \nFinance chief Brandgaard said the current bid could be revised if Ablynx agreed to engage in talks. \n\u201cI think it would be natural to update the bid following a detailed discussion with the board of directors of Ablynx,\u201d he said on a conference call, adding that it would be premature to speculate on any increase. \nBrandgaard also played down the threat of an interloper, saying: \u201cIn terms of counter proposals it is not our understanding that any other bidder is pursuing the target.\u201d \nBELGIUM\u2018S THRIVING BIOTECH SCENE \nAblynx had already rejected an offer by the Danish group on Dec. 14 and Novo Nordisk said the new bid, made on Dec. 22, was some 14 percent higher. \n(Graphic for Ablynx share price, click reut.rs\/2CDOfaI ) \n\u201cNovo Nordisk regrets that the board of directors of Ablynx has so far declined to engage in any discussions, despite the proposals which have been put forward,\u201d it said in a statement. \nAnalysts at Jefferies said they had a fair value of Ablynx at 29 euros per share, rising to 36 euros under a long term upside scenario. \n\u201cWe envisage Novo needing to hike the offer and could see counterbids,\u201d the analysts said. \nTax breaks and other incentives have created a thriving biotech industry in Belgium, with many companies spun off from university projects now listed on its stock exchange. \nAblynx\u2019s shares have almost doubled in price in the past 12 months, buoyed by successful clinical trial data. \nIts products, which are all still undergoing medical trials, target many different diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis or cancer. \nEvercore is advising Novo, while JP Morgan is working for Ablynx.

He forecasts unemployment will stay low this year before rising a few tenths of a percentage point next year, and inflation to push above 2 percent in 2019 before coming back to the Fed\u2019s target in 2020. There is \u201clittle slack\u201d left in the labour market, he said.\nBut, he said, \u201cif soft inflation persists, it may pose a significant problem,\u201d including making it more difficult to bring inflation back to target.\nReporting by Ann Saphir and Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n "}

Instead, the Browns pulled off the difficult feat of actually regressing, becoming only the second team in NFL history to go 0-16, joining the 2008 Detroit Lions. \n\u201cLet\u2019s just be honest and put it out there, I\u2018m disappointed, I\u2018m pissed off, because I never saw this being this way in two years here, ever.\u201d Jackson said recently. \n\u201cI made that statement (about swimming in the lake). I got to back it up.\u201d \nWhether he does so during the frigid winter, or waits for balmier weather and warmer water remains to be seen. \nEarly on in 2017 it seemed the Browns would win a game or two. Their first seven games included four narrow defeats by three points, but a promising autumn subsequently gave way to a bitter winter of discontent and a series of embarrassing defeats, culminating in a four-point loss against a second-string Pittsburgh team on Sunday. \n\u201cThis is going to stay next to my name and the organization\u2019s name for the rest of our lives,\u201d Jackson said after Sunday\u2019s game. \n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. We\u2019ll turn the page on this and move forward.\u201d \nNot that the team\u2019s long suffering fans will expect much difference in 2018, even though the Browns, with the first and fourth picks in the upcoming draft, should improve if they make wise choices, a big \u201cif\u201d based on recent history. \nThe Browns have missed the playoffs in 15 successive seasons, and have just one winning season in that stretch, going 67-173. \nSo why have the Browns remained so perennially bad when their poor record has given them so many high draft picks? \nThe reasons are somewhat debatable, but some bad draft choices (and non-choices) have not helped, none more disastrous than overlooking Ohio\u2019s very own Ben Roethlisberger in the 2004 draft. \nBig Ben instead went to the nearby Pittsburgh Steelers, and the rest is history (two Super Bowl championships). \nOn the other side of the ledger was the decision to take another quarterback, college football Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel, in 2014, with a view to making the quarterback the face of the franchise, only to watch him self-destruct with a series of off-field problems that left him unemployed two years later. \nThe quarterback issue still has not been solved. In the past couple of years the Browns have passed on the likes of Deshuan Watson and Carson Wentz, who have blossomed with other teams, while DeShone Kizer labored in his first season. \nCoach Jackson is not immune from blame either, but owner Jimmy Haslam should ultimately shoulder most of the responsibility since he bought the team from Randy Lerner in 2012. \nHindsight is always easy, but it cannot be denied that Haslam has made some questionable decisions, not least putting together a front office that realized too late that jettisoning so many veterans in favor of young players who were not NFL-ready was a dubious strategy.

Custeel's chief analyst Hu Yanping said Fortescue will use its iron ore price index as part of its payment scheme. \nBHP, which used Mysteel for spot cargoes in 2015, said it was committed to the development of a range of credible iron ore indices. \n\"The use of Mysteel Iron Ore Index supports BHP's wish to meet customer demand and ensure transparent and robust pricing,\" it said in an emailed statement. \nFortescue did not comment directly on price formulas but said it has been working with customers in China, its largest market, and recognised the increasing maturity of Chinese indices. \nIMPORTED ORE DOMINATES \nThe pricing change was spearheaded by the China Iron & Steel Association, an industry body representing medium and large-sized mills, which raised the issue with foreign miners last year, a source familiar with the matter said. \nIron ore prices have rebounded in the past couple of years, but most forecasters see prices weakening in 2018 on the back of slower Chinese economic growth and Beijing's efforts to tackle overcapacity and air pollution. \n\"Miners have high sales pressure and have offered to use Chinese indices for settlement,\" said one mill source, declining to be named as he's not authorised to speak to media. \nCitic's Zhou said there was little difference between Platts and Mysteel indices on a monthly average basis, but prices could differ on particular days, which had led to some dissatisfaction from Chinese mills. \nS&P Global Platts head of Metals Vera Blei said the company's benchmarks aimed to reflect the market, and the company actively consults with market participants. \nRecent formal consultations had allowed Platts to evolve its benchmarks, in line with changes in the iron ore market as it became more precise and efficient, she said in an emailed statement. \nBrazil's Vale said in an email the company uses different market indices for spot deals, while Rio Tinto said iron ore pricing was confidential. \n(Reporting by Ruby Lian and Josephine Mason; Additional reporting by Manolo Serapio Jr in MANILA, Sonali Paul in MELBOURNE, Shanghai newsroom, Luciano Costa de Paula in SAO PAULO; editing by Richard Pullin)"}

Google has used AI in several parts of its business , and now the company is looking to make the technology easier for many people to adopt, which could boost Google's cloud effort as a whole. \nOn Wednesday the company introduced a tool that's designed to simplify the process of deploying AI in business applications. It's called Cloud AutoML, and it's already being used by companies including Disney and Urban Outfitters to make search and shopping on their websites more relevant. \nCloud AutoML is starting with image recognition, allowing customers to drag in images and train their systems to recognize them on Google's cloud. \n\"Currently, only a handful of businesses in the world have access to the talent and budgets needed to fully appreciate the advancements of ML and AI,\" Jia Li, head of research and development for Google's cloud AI unit, and Fei-Fei Li, the group's chief scientist, wrote in a blog post. \"We believe Cloud AutoML will make AI experts even more productive, advance new fields in AI and help less-skilled engineers build powerful AI systems they previously only dreamed of.\" \nCloud AutoML Vision can figure out what's inside images that users upload, train a model based on those images, provide analysis of the model, and then start to make sense of new images as they come in, based on what it has learned. The new service joins Google's Cloud Machine Learning Engine and its Cloud Vision application programming interface but unlike those products, the Cloud AutoML portfolio wasn't designed just with developers in mind. \nTwo months ago, cloud market leader Amazon Web Services introduced Amazon SageMaker for building and launching their own AI models. And last May, Microsoft introduced a service for customizing image recognition models. Google had 12 percent public cloud market share in the fourth quarter, KeyBanc analysts said last week. \nLike Amazon and Microsoft, Google also offers developer tools for speech recognition and language translation, although they are not as easy to customize as the new Cloud AutoML tool. \nEarly results suggest that the new system works better than Google's past methods of image recognition, Jia Li said in a media briefing. The technology was developed through collaboration with multiple other internal AI teams, she said. Jordan Novet Technology Reporter for CNBC.com Related Securities "}

He does, however, caution that there are fundamental factors that could derail the chip rally.\n\"In the long run, this ... is hypersensitive to global growth, so if you start to see any kind of deceleration of investment spending, you have to not be quite complacent with this one,\" he said on \"Power Lunch.\" \"But we think in [the first quarter], you're going to see an outperformance in relationship to the S&P 500.\"\nWhile Intel is one of the biggest components of SMH, the group as a whole continued to move higher on Wednesday as other names surged on the back of Intel's processor issues.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

I had learned to make basic iPhone apps, but it was immediately clear I wasn't going to be coming up with the next app idea that was going to go viral.\nI set a goal for myself to get a job at a top-tier tech company to jumpstart my career.\nMore from Glassdoor: \n8 reasons why you didn't make it past the first interview \nWhat your references should say about you\nHow to make your career change dream into reality \nA series of setbacks I spent days perfecting my resume , but couldn't get an interview. Naturally, I assumed that meant I had to work on it more. I agonized over every word and drove myself crazy with formatting. I finally perfected it, and every time I applied to a job posting, I was filled with hope. This is going to be the job that gets me into tech , I thought . \nBut I wasn't getting interviews. Even when I was applying through referrals , I wouldn't hear back. Eventually, it hit me: I was applying to the wrong roles.\nshow chapters Suzy Welch: The surprising career advice Jeff Bezos gave me      8:56 AM ET Tue, 7 Nov 2017 | 01:46 I was going after software engineering and product manager roles at brand-name tech companies with limited programming and no product experience. No wonder I was getting rejected left and right \u2014 I was applying to roles I aspired to one day have, but in reality, my background and skills didn't meet the needs for those positions. At least, not yet. I had to change my approach.\nInstead of thinking about what I wanted, I thought about it from the company's perspective: What needs do they have that I can fill right now? \nLook for stepping stones This approach is especially helpful if you're transitioning into tech from a different industry, non-traditional background or just don't have the relevant experiences for the role you want.\nSince I didn't have the background or experience to get interviews for my aspirational roles, I started looking for positions that would be stepping stones toward them. I looked for roles that would give me relevant experiences for my next job \u2014 I was thinking two roles ahead.\nBefore applying to my aspirational role, I wanted to make sure I had two things. First, experience working at a brand-name tech company. Second, a role that gave me an understanding of how end-users used products. I knew those experiences would help prepare me for the job I would apply to next.\nWith that in mind, I honed in my job search on technical customer support roles. I wanted an end-user facing role where I could leverage the technical skills I built up learning how to make simple iPhone apps earlier in the year.\nshow chapters Suzy Welch: This rarely used tactic will help you get ahead      8:56 AM ET Tue, 24 Oct 2017 | 01:36 My big break Once I started to apply for those roles, I was getting interviews, not rejections, left and right.\nI had my sights set on the Forward Deployed Engineer role at Palantir and what later became the Product Specialist role at Dropbox . These two roles hit the criteria for the experiences I wanted to gain for future roles. Just as important, I had the background and skills that these roles needed now .\nAfter going through onsite interviews at both companies, I eventually joined Dropbox as a Product Specialist (then called Embedded User Operations Engineer). I was able to immediately contribute in my first role at Dropbox and in one year, I transferred to the Partnerships team. A year after that, I successfully went through the internal interview process to become a Product Manager, my aspirational role.\nWhere you are now is not where you are going to be By recommending stepping-stone roles, I'm not telling you to sell yourself short \u2014 I'm telling you to invest in your future. When you're trying to break into tech, for example, focus on getting into a tech company first, then transitioning into your aspirational role.\nEveryone's situation is different, so by all means, if you'd like, go after your aspirational role right away. But if you're not even getting interviews, you may want to take a step back and consider if you're applying for the right roles.\nLike this story?

We have to look at the best combination to try and win the game and he will certainly come into the discussion but it depends on the formation of the team we put on the field.\u201d QUICK WICKET \nGibson, recently appointed South Africa coach after previously serving as England\u2019s bowling coach, said the hosts had asked for a quick wicket to be prepared and that looks likely to be the case at the toss on Friday. But he warned the bowlers they still had to efficiently use the favourable conditions. \n\u201cWith some grass on the wicket, bowlers sometimes tend to get a bit carried away. You still have to put the ball in the right area. However the wicket looks, you still have to play well on it. We will be playing the best team in the world, so we have to bring our A-game,\u201d he said. (Editing by Christian Radnedge)"}

It\u2019s an important finding to keep in mind\u2014but also comes with some caveats, and isn\u2019t exactly a clarion call to ditch painkillers like ibuprofen (sold under brand names like Advil and Motrin) altogether. \nIbuprofen is an anti-inflammatory that\u2019s commonly used to treat fevers and pain. In the new study, researchers found that prolonged, high-dosage use of ibuprofen may cause changes to levels of so-called \u201cluteinizing hormones,\u201d which induce the testicles to produce testosterone. With testosterone and luteinizing hormones out of whack, the subjects in the trial taking the ibuprofen developed a form of \u201chypogonadism,\u201d which is usually prevalent in older men and is associated with male infertility and other health effects, including fatigue and depression. \nSubscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily , our newsletter about the most exciting health innovations. \nThe study, although small, appears to be well-structured. It was a randomized control trial, with one group of participants receiving ibuprofen and the others receiving placebo. So the findings merit further research. \nBut the amount and frequency of ibuprofen use in the study is fairly atypical\u2014the maximum recommended dosage of 1,200 milligrams per day every day for two weeks. So it\u2019s not much cause for concern for the occasional user (even high doses over a week-long time frame would likely not lead to permanent hormonal changes, according to the study authors). \nBut long-distance runners and athletes who regularly take ibuprofen during training or sports matches in order to ward off inflammation may want to keep an eye on the research. As the study authors note, it\u2019s unclear whether constant, long-term, and high-dose use of ibuprofen could have more lasting changes on male hormones. \nIbuprofen isn\u2019t the only common painkiller that\u2019s come under the spotlight, either. Acetaminophen, one of the most commonly used drugs in America, carries liver damage risk, and some studies have linked its use by pregnant women with behavioral issues in their children.

Macy's also said at the time it would close 34 more stores \"over the next few years\" as leases or operating covenants expired, or as sale transactions were completed. Those closures are beginning to roll out in 2018 as Macy's looks to generate much-needed cash from its real estate. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Macy's flagship store in Herald Square, New York City. \nLittle by little, Macy's is beginning to close some of the roughly 30 stores it previously announced were on the chopping block. So far, 11 stores have been identified for closure, and four of those stores' teams have been notified, the company told CNBC Wednesday. \nAbout this same time last year, Macy's posted disappointing holiday sales and simultaneously released the locations of more than 60 stores it planned to close in 2017. Additionally, the company said at the time it would close 34 more stores \"over the next few years\" as leases or operating covenants expired, or as sale transactions were completed (making 100 closures in total). \nBusiness Insider said Wednesday that more closures were coming in 2018 from that group of 34 locations. An official announcement has yet to be made from the department store chain, but one is expected to come later this week based on the timing of past press releases. \nAmong the closures is reported to be a Macy's location at Fountain Place in Cincinnati, Ohio, where the retailer is headquartered, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer . \nMacy's shares closed Wednesday down 3.7 percent on the news after rallying for most of the day Tuesday . \n\"Macy's, Inc. has been reviewing its real estate portfolio across the country to see if there are opportunities to improve the use of our assets,\" Macy's told CNBC in a statement. \n\"While closing a store is always a difficult decision because of the impact on our customers, our associates and the community, we deeply appreciate the loyalty of our customers and associates,\" the company added. \nThe Cincinnati-based retailer has said it wants to focus on its best real estate while investing more in its web operations, in a push to win more shoppers online. \n\"We're getting better and better at this because, as we've closed more stores, we've learned a lot about how to retain sales in other stores,\" CFO Karen Hoguet said on a call with analysts and investors, discussing the closures of 2017. \nMeantime, Macy's is testing smaller versions of its off-price concept, Macy's Backstage, inside some of its existing stores, which appeals to customers looking for more of a \"treasure hunt\" shopping experience. The department store chain, like its peers, has been forced to revise its massive floor plans, as fewer shoppers venture to America's malls to ring up purchases. \nHaving faced pressure before from activist investor Starboard ( which sold its stake in the company in 2017 ) to separate its real estate from its retail business, Macy's has still been taking steps to make money from those assets. \nManagement updated analysts and investors this past November , saying Macy's would continue to explore opportunities with Brookfield Asset Management on about 50 properties, including the department store chain's flagship Herald Square location in New York. \nMacy's has also struck deals in the past with some of its landlords, including General Growth Properties , to sell locations and generate cash in a pinch. \nAhead of this year's key holiday shopping season, Macy's, like many of its retail peers, was touting its ability to lure shoppers into its stores, where it has been making bigger investments in customer service and loyalty. \nCEO Jeff Gennette has already told CNBC the company started the holiday season on a strong note compared with 2016. Promotions were also less severe, he said, which should be helping profit margins. Top-selling items included coats, boots, sweaters and fragrances. \nAs of its fiscal third quarter, Macy's operated roughly 860 stores under various brands, including Macy's, Macy's Backstage, Bloomingdale's, and Bluemercury. \nShares of the department store chain have fallen more than 25 percent over the past 12 months. \n\u2014 CNBC's Courtney Reagan contributed to this reporting.

Job growth slowed more than expected last month amid a decline in retail employment, but a pick-up in monthly wage gains pointed to labor market strength that could pave the way for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in March. With Tokyo on holiday, trading volumes were low, and this morning's moves were muted. Yields on U.S. government bonds opened higher this morning before falling to rates hit late last week. Attention is now focused on new supply with the U.S. Treasury Department to auction new three-year notes on Tuesday, 10-year notes on Wednesday and 30-year bonds on Thursday. Demand for three-year notes may be mixed given that the U.S. central bank is expected to continue hiking interest rates. But sales of long-term securities are expected to go well. \"Since 10-years seem to be firmly entrenched in that 2.40 percent to 2.50 percent area, I would think that should have a tendency to garner some interest,\" Mary Anne Hurley, vice president of fixed income at D.A.

The action by Attorney General Jeff Sessions could harm the burgeoning marijuana industry in six states including California and Colorado.\nThe U.S.-listed ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF, which launched on Dec. 26, closed down 6.2 percent. Canada's Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF ended down 8.7 percent.\nAphria Inc, which has operations in Florida and Arizona, closed 13.8 percent lower, after falling as much as 22.7 percent earlier in the day.\nCannaRoyalty Corp, tumbled 15.8 percent.

Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: kit.rees.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net 2017 sees record number of deals worldwide (1435 GMT) Deal making is another theme investors are considering at the beginning of the year, and whether the M&A wagon will continue to roll on in 2018. Last year was another blockbuster year: the number of worldwide deals hit a record in 2017, totaling $3.6 trillion, according to Thomson Reuters data. This was also the fourth year in a row where M&A activity surpassed $3 trillion. Interestingly while European M&A was up 17 percent in 2017, the U.S. saw a decline of 16 percent in the value of deals. Perhaps this is testament to the strength of the European economy, or the fact that debt has been so cheap? Here's a graphic from our Deals Intelligence colleagues: (Kit Rees) ** Gnawing on the bone of European equities: enjoy it while it lasts (1339 GMT) SocGen has repeatedly warned its clients that European equities are close to their historical averages in terms of valuation. Its message today is that there is \"not much meat on the bone\" left, even if today's traders seem to be in a clear \"risk-on\" mood. Strategists reckon \"exit strategies\" will do better this year as central banks start to turn the taps of stimulus off, and recommend holding sovereign bonds over equities. \"Be ready for the end of Goldilocks,\" strategists warn. Here are SocGen's top tips : (Helen Reid and Julien Ponthus) Lunchtime Update: European stocks hold in positive territory (1325 GMT) As we cruise into afternoon trading, European stocks remain positive, with tech the top-gaining sector. Over in the U.S. stocks futures are pointing to Wall St also opening higher, following the S&P 500's record close. Here's your European equity market snapshot: (Kit Rees) Shorting UK retailers, there's your thriller! (1222 GMT) While the first MIFID II trading day is not the action movie some had expected, the return to favour today of the UK retail sector is likely to be a real thriller (and not in a good way) for those short sellers who are betting on its downfall. Data from Astec Short Interest compiled by Helen shows that the amount of Next shares on loan surged in a year, from 2.3 million last January to 4.3 million yesterday. The cost to borrow also rose, indicating demand to short the shares increased. No doubt many of those short sellers are feeling the squeeze today and exiting their trades, helping the stock rise. Next, which had a horrible start in 2017, losing over 17 percent on Jan 4, is currently leading the FTSE with a 7 percent jump, lifting the sector with the likes of Primark owner Associated British Foods. Alasdair has an additional interesting fact for you : out of the 10 most shorted British stocks, 5 are from the retail sector: Debenhams, Ocado, WM Morrison, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury. (Julien Ponthus and Helen Reid) ** Buy-side traders say MiFID II could make it harder to access quality liquidity -survey (1120 GMT) Although the wide-ranging new regulations don't seem to be making huge ripples in trading immediately, some buy-side traders think it could make their jobs more difficult, a survey by trading platform ITG found. While 45 percent of respondents thought MiFID II would have \"no significant impact\" on their ability to access quality liquidity, 37 percent said it would become harder. That's nearly twice the 18 percent who saw the regulation actually helping traders find liquidity. Of course what makes liquidity 'quality' could be subjective, but MiFID II's clampdown on dark pools certainly takes some of the options off the table for traders. The survey also revealed some interesting patterns in the types of venues traders are more likely to transact in post-MiFID. Traditional lit markets were by far the most popular, while traders were more likely to shun electronic market maker and bank SIs. As many traders have been telling us this morning, it'll take a little more adaptation time before we can see for sure who the MiFID winners and losers are. (Helen Reid) ** If MIFID II were a movie, it wouldn't be a thriller (1100 GMT) While there has been some kind of excitement ahead of the implementation today of MIFID II rules, the feedback we're getting from trading floors across the markets is, well, not that exciting at all. \"At 1125, Paris time, after more than two hours of trading, there is nothing in particular to report,\" a major asset manager told us. There is, according to Thomson Reuters data, a drop in activity. Our correspondent Alasdair Pal, who dug the data, reports volumes on the STOXX 600 were down by around 25 percent in the first hour of Wednesday compared with a day previously. Against the first hour of trading on Jan 3 2017, volumes were down by 11 percent. Antoine Lesne, head of SPDR ETF Strategy for EMEA at State Street, told Helen that was to be expected. \"We clearly expect a slightly slower take-off as people are testing the pipes and so on. The expectation is that it (trading) will be slower but I am not sure. It was very slow yesterday as well so I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s because of MiFID only\". Maybe City A.M.'s spooky front page was a bit over the top: (Julien Ponthus) Dark pool migration drives December volumes for exchanges -UBS (1022 GMT) On the topic of MiFID II, UBS analysts made an interesting observation about the market share gains traditional European exchanges enjoyed in December 2017: \"We believe the December gains to market share were driven by a migration of volume away from dark venues as the market prepares for the implementation of the Double Volume Caps under MiFID II (starting today).\" Euronext is UBS' top pick and they also rate Deutsche Boerse a \"buy\", while LSE and Flow Traders are \"neutral\" and BME is a \"sell\". (Kit Rees) ** European stocks hold on to gains, FTSE muted (1002 GMT) While the STOXX 600 is off its early highs, it's still in positive territory as industrials, health stocks and retailers drive gains, though it's pretty quiet just after the festive season. The FTSE 100 is the laggard, flat even though sterling has given up its gains following a disappointing construction PMI. Financials are taking the most points off the FTSE, followed by consumer staples. Here's your mid-morning market snapshot: (Kit Rees) ** Stronger start for European equities (0817) It's a decidedly stronger open across the European benchmarks this morning with Next leading the way on the STOXX 600, up 7.5 percent after its Christmas sales beat. Marks & Spencer is rising as well as concerns around the ailing retail sector are placated somewhat by Next's update. Cyclical strength is also coming back with industrials and tech stocks helping drive the market. Apple supplier AMS is up 5.5 percent after the iPhone maker and other Internet giants drove gains on Wall Street. No sign yet of MiFID I"}

It's a slight whiff of euphoria around the stock market rally, the first time I have smelled it in a long time.\nOh sure, the market has been richly valued for a long time, but that's different than euphoria. A lot of people suddenly seem to believe that things are going to get a lot better in 2018.\nMaybe, but remember one of the best things the market has had going for it for the past seven or eight years is how hated the rally has been.\nNow people are starting to like the rally. A lot. Makes me a little nervous.\nHere's something else that makes me nervous. The bar is now very high on the two most important components for stock valuations: economic data and earnings.\nEconomic data The recent data have surpassed expectations, particularly in the U.S. The ADP jobs report was way above expectations , but that has happened a lot recently.\nJust look at these recent headlines: \"Strongest month of job gains since March 2017,\" \"Job-cut announcements in 2017 see lowest level since 1990, Challenger report says,\" \"Commodity prices hit highest point since 2014.\"\nSee what I mean? Citigroup's Economic Surprise Index, a measure of how much recent economic stats have been above or below expectations, is now at the third-highest level since the financial recovery.\nEconomic growth well above expectations could be an issue for stocks. Pretty soon, we will be back to debating when \"good\" economic news is \"bad\" for the markets because it increases the chances the Fed will suddenly get more aggressive on rate hikes.\nYou will know we have reached that point when the market suddenly droops on economic data that comes in above expectations. That's why a lot of traders will be watching the market reaction if we get a blowout number on the jobs report Friday morning.\nEarnings Earnings are expected to grow more than 15 percent this year. The upcoming earnings season had better be damn positive. I'm not talking about just earnings beats. I'm talking about more buybacks AND more capital investment. The whole enchilada.\nThe problem is we are in uncharted waters because the move to Dow 25K has come so fast. We not only rallied going into the close of the year, the rally at the start of the year has taken everyone by surprise, far surpassing the typical first-day putting-money-to-work story.\nThe breadth has been particularly impressive. Everything is up. Big caps and small caps. Growth and value. Cyclicals and staples. The only sectors not participating are interest-rate sensitive REITs and utilities, which are bond proxies.\nLook, I am not by nature a bear, but when you start seeing the broader press mention the Dow at 25,000 \u2014 as we saw Thursday \u2014 sit up and take notice."}

He declined to say how long into 2019 the policy of holding rates might extend. \n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to do anything original. There is a disparity in rates (between Poland and other countries) at around 2 percent and nothing will be changed here,\u201d he said. \nDespite expectations that growth in gross domestic product had exceeded an annual rate of 5 percent in the last quarter of 2017, Poland\u2019s inflation slowed in December to 2.0 percent. The central bank\u2019s target is 2.5 percent plus or minus one percentage point. \nGlapinski said prices in Poland were under control because of the effects of globalisation. \nThe zloty currency did not react to the central bank governor\u2019s comments. It was already slightly losing steam this week in anticipation of dovish Glapinski remarks after a short stint of strength last week.

A winter storm is traveling up the east coast of the United States dumping snow and creating blizzard like conditions in many areas. Days after a powerful winter storm took aim at the Northeast, air travel chaos continues, raising the question of whether Monday will bring any relief. \nNew York's John F. Kennedy International airport was the cause of many travelers' grief this weekend, in large part because of the inclement weather . On Saturday, an Aeroflot flight from Moscow bound for New York turned back about halfway through the trip, while dozens of other inbound flights were diverted to other U.S. airports.\nWidebody planes that just arrived at JFK, carrying thousands of passengers from all corners of the globe, sat on taxiways for hours. Meanwhile, passengers inside were left to deal with long delays, while some struggled to get information about their flights.\nThis was the fallout of a snowstorm that prompted the nearly 24-hour closure of JFK, which received more than 31 million international travelers in 2016 \u2014 more than any other U.S. airport. The bottleneck was so severe a day after the airport opened, the Federal Aviation Administration limited the number of flights destined for three of the airport's terminals on Saturday.\nMore than 5,000 flights were canceled because of the storm, according to FlightAware, a flight-tracking site. More than 200 flight in and out of JFK were delayed and 42 were canceled on Sunday.\nHowever, delays around the country are expected to be minimal on Monday, according to FlightAware. That would be a welcome reprieve for both leisure and business travelers, many of whom are hitting the road after the holidays for conferences around the country and beyond.\nJFK halted operations during the storm, opening the following day, which kicked off a days' long scramble for access to gates. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, said low temperatures after the storm made it more difficult to operate ground equipment, causing further delays.\nU.S. and international airlines, including British Airways, have said they will waive date-change fees for travelers booked into JFK and other area airports, for flights as late as Jan. 8 if they can fly a different day next week.\nCorrection: The Aeroflot from Moscow was forced to turn around on Saturday."}

FILE PHOTO: Boxes of iPhone X are pictured during its launch at the Apple store in Singapore, November 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Edgar Su\/File Photo \nHedge fund JANA Partners LLC and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System (CalSTRS) pension fund said on Saturday that iPhone overuse could be hurting children\u2019s developing brains, an issue that may harm the company\u2019s long-term market value. \nBut some investors said the habit-forming nature of gadgets and social media are one reason why companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc added $630 billion to their market value in 2017. \n\u201cWe invest in things that are addictive,\u201d said Apple shareholder Ross Gerber, chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management. \nHe also owns stock in coffee retailer Starbucks Corp, casino operator MGM Resorts International and alcohol maker Constellation Brands Inc. \n\u201cAddictive things are very profitable,\u201d Gerber said. \nStill, the investment community is increasingly holding companies to higher social standards, and there is some concern that market-leading tech companies could draw attention from regulators much like alcohol, tobacco and gambling companies have in the past. \nAlphabet and Facebook could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. Facebook has said social media can be beneficial if used appropriately. \nIn a statement to Reuters, Apple said it has offered a range of controls on iPhones since 2008 that allow parents to restrict content, including apps, movies, websites, songs and books, as well as cellular data, password settings and other features. \n\u201cEffectively anything a child could download or access online can be easily blocked or restricted by a parent,\u201d Apple said in the statement. \nApple shares fell marginally on Monday. CalSTRS holds $1.9 billion in Apple stock, a sliver of the company\u2019s nearly $900 billion market value, while JANA declined to disclose the size of its smaller stake. \n\u201cBefore Apple speaks, I think it\u2019s too early to change the narrative\u201d for investors, said Peter Jones, vice president of research for Ferguson Wellman Capital Management, which has about 350,000 Apple shares. \nSocial media companies, not hardware makers, are more deserving of any addiction-related scrutiny, some said. \nJordan Waldrep, who invests in alcohol, tobacco and gambling stocks as manager of the USA Mutuals Vice Fund, said blaming Apple for its customers\u2019 addiction was analogous to blaming makers of cigarette packs instead of tobacco companies. FILE PHOTO: A attendee uses a new iPhone X during a presentation for the media in Beijing, China October 31, 2017. REUTERS\/Thomas Peter\/File Photo \n\u201cThe social media, the cigarettes, are the addictive product,\u201d he said. Waldrep\u2019s Vice fund does not own Apple, but Waldrep said he would consider including social media companies. \nKim Forrest, senior portfolio manager and vice president at Fort Pitt Capital Group, agreed that companies like Facebook, Twitter Inc and Snap Inc might be more at risk than Apple if investors and regulators push back on how much time people spend on mobile devices. \n\u201cApple is just the delivery device,\u201d said Forrest, who said Fort Pitt has limited Apple holdings. \u201cIt\u2019s only compelling with software. Software is the dopamine releaser that keeps you coming back.\u201d \nTwitter declined to comment and Snap could not immediately be reached. \nThe letter from JANA and CalSTRS recommends Apple set up a committee of child-development experts and make more new tools available to parents. \nIn its statement, Apple did not directly respond to the investors\u2019 demands but said changes are in store for its parental controls. It did not provide details. \n\u201cWe are constantly looking for ways to make our experiences better,\u201d Apple said. \u201cWe have new features and enhancements planned for the future, to add functionality and make these tools even more robust.\u201d \nThe addiction issue gained notoriety when former Disney child star Selena Gomez said she cancelled a 2016 world tour to go to therapy for depression and low self-esteem, feelings she linked to a social media addiction. \nFears about smartphone addiction have already kicked off regulatory backlash. In December, the French education minister said mobile phones would be banned in schools, and draft legislation in France would require children under 16 to seek parental approval to open a Facebook account. \nEven tech insiders are among the vocal critics of social media and its addictive potential. \n\u201cApple Watches, Google Phones, Facebook, Twitter - they\u2019ve gotten so good at getting us to go for another click, another dopamine hit,\u201d said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive, on Twitter. \nJohn Streur, chief executive of Calvert Research and Management, an Apple shareholder that focuses on social responsibility, said it is plausible that tech devices may some day be understood to hold risks we do not currently understand well. \nThat would hurt investors if evidence later emerged that companies intentionally built features that create dependency and had evidence that doing so was unsafe. \nFor the time being, John Carey, a portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston, said concerns over the human impacts from being glued to screens are not likely to cut into profits. The company holds Apple stock, but the funds Carey manages do not. \n\u201cI doubt there will be any impact on the use of smartphones,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re already addicted to them.\u201d Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Additional reporting by Ross Kerber, April Joyner, Sinead Carew, David Ingram, Elizabeth Dilts and Stephen Nellis; Editing by Megan Davies, Meredith Mazzilli and Leslie Adler"}

Earlier this month, Republican Senator Susan Collins said she would back the effort to overturn the FCC\u2019s move. Democrats need 51 votes to win any proposal in the Republican-controlled Senate because Vice President Mike Pence can break any tie. \nThe FCC voted in December along party lines to reverse rules introduced in 2015 that barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic or offering paid fast lanes, also known as paid prioritization. The new rules will not take effect for several months, the FCC has said. \nA group of 21 state attorneys general on Tuesday, including California, New York and Virginia, filed a petition for a review of the decision with an appeals court in Washington, arguing the FCC\u2019s action was \u201carbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion\u201d and that it violated federal laws and regulations. An appeal may not be heard until the rules officially take effect later this year. \nA reversal of the FCC decision needs the approval of the Senate, the House of Representatives and President Donald Trump. Trump backed the FCC action, the White House said last month, and overturning a presidential veto requires a two-thirds vote of both chambers. \nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said the issue would be a major motivating factor for the young voters the party is courting. \nA trade group representing major tech companies including Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc said it would support legal challenges to the reversal. \nThe vote in December marked a victory for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc and handed them power over what content consumers can access on the internet. It was the biggest win for FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in his sweeping effort to undo many telecommunications regulations. \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, backs the FCC repeal. \nWhile the FCC order grants internet providers sweeping new powers it does require public disclosure of the blocking practices. Internet providers have vowed not to change how consumers obtain online content. \nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, a Republican, said in an interview on Tuesday he planned to hold a hearing on paid prioritization. He has urged Democrats to work constructively on a legislative solution to net neutrality \u201cto bring certainty and clarity going forward and ban behaviors like blocking and throttling.\u201d \nHe said he does not believe a vote to overturn the FCC decision would get a majority in the U.S. House. Representative Mike Doyle, a Democrat, said Tuesday that his bill to reverse the FCC decision had 80 cosponsors. \nPaid prioritization is part of American life, Walden said. \u201cWhere do you want to sit on the airplane? Where do you want to sit on Amtrak?\u201d he said. Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Leslie Adler"}

However, Adam believes it is the players that must take responsibility for the team\u2019s record of five defeats in their last seven league games. \n\u201dWe\u2019re in the mix now,\u201c Adam told the club\u2019s website (www.stokecityfc.com). \u201dWe are down there fighting for survival, and we need to find some character to get us out of this mess. \n\u201cWe need to stand up and be counted, because as a group of players, we are the ones who have put ourselves in the situation we\u2019re in.\u201d \nThe Scot said that Stoke should prioritise the league over FA Cup fixtures but urged the team to get a much-needed morale boost by beating Coventry City in the cup competition on Saturday. \n\u201cLeague form must take priority, but when you\u2019re in this situation, you just have to win games.

[nL8N1OL4RU]\nThe holiday rota errors were a rare serious slip-up by Chief Executive Michael O\u2018Leary, whose formula of dirt cheap, no-frills travel has transformed the continent\u2019s airline sector and handed his shareholders big returns.\nO\u2018Leary had said hell would freeze over before he would welcome unions into Ryanair. The company now says dialogue with organized labor will help the business.\nAnalysts say it will inflate its costs and could reduce the flexibility that helped it steal chunks of business from traditional airlines such as Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) and Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ).\nTop shareholder HSBC Global Asset Managers has cut a quarter of its Ryanair stake, according to a filing last month. HSBC declined to comment on the decision.\nBut other big Ryanair shareholders are maintaining or adding to their holdings.\n\u201cBecause the share price has fallen, it has become, in our opinion, compellingly attractive,\u201d said Rory Powe, who manages European growth stocks at Man GLG and added to his Ryanair holdings in December. \u201cI don\u2019t see Ryanair\u2019s cost advantage being eroded by anything more than an immaterial amount.\u201d\nRyanair\u2019s longer-term record as an investment may help explain why top shareholders appear reluctant to drop it.\nThe shares are up 150 percent over four years as it tackled a reputation for shoddy services and wooed higher-paying business passengers. Shares in its most successful rival, Easyjet ( EZJ.L ), have barely moved in that time.\nAnalysts agree upcoming union negotiations will be crucial, amid questions over whether O\u2018Leary\u2019s pugnacious management style is still appropriate for a company that was once an upstart challenger but now dominates European short-haul air travel.\n\u201cA unionized Ryanair will still be profitable, cash generative and value-creating in our view but will be a markedly different company,\u201d HSBC analysts said last week, rating the shares \u201creduce\u201d.\nHSBC believes Ryanair unit costs could rise by 20 percent by 2020, with unionization and the localization of contracts, and that Ryanair\u2019s talks with continental unions could be tough, \u201c...and airline strikes in these markets are commonplace\u201d.\nBernstein sees a short-term rebound in the stock but believes Ryanair is \u201ccornered\u201d - profitability per passenger will fall if it continues to expand at the current pace but a slowdown in expansion will cause earnings to decline.\n\u201cCATEGORY KILLER\u201d\nOther big Ryanair institutional investors acknowledge the challenges but believe that, with its cost base still below rivals, it can still make bumper profits as the euro zone economy picks up steam, industry capacity growth eases and prices recover.\nRyanair has said it does not expect its costs to increase significantly.\nJonathan Fearon, who runs the Aberdeen Standard European Growth fund, said the market seemed to be pricing in the idea that Ryanair\u2019s cost advantage will disappear.\nBut he said staff costs were only one of many advantages in Ryanair\u2019s broad \u201cultra-low-cost\u201d business model.\nFearon indicated Ryanair was still a favorite: it was a \u201ccategory killer\u201d in short-haul that stood to gain from Alitalia\u2019s troubles and as industry capacity growth slows, boosting fares.\nTony Gibb, investment director at another Ryanair shareholder, Fidelity, said the company\u2019s significant cost advantage, even over EasyJet, was \u201csustainable\u201d and last month\u2019s share slump was \u201cprobably overplayed\u201d.\n\u201cThere is negative press and the share price has come off quite meaningfully but that is probably more of an opportunity than anything else,\u201d said Gibb.\nAdditional reporting by Conor Humphries and Victoria Bryan Graphics by Ritvik Carvalho; Editing by Susan Fenton\n "}

Chicago Board of Trade March wheat was up 1.3 percent at $4.55-1\/4 a bushel by 1120 GMT, having risen by 1.8 percent on Monday. Chicago's most-active wheat contract on Tuesday hit its highest since Sept. 29 at $4.55-1\/4 a bushel. March soybeans were up 0.1 percent at $9.93 a bushel and March corn rose 0.3 percent to $3.60 a bushel. We are certainly now in a weather market, with wheat focusing on conditions in the United States, while soybeans and corn are influenced by conditions in South America, said Graydon Chong, senior commodity analyst with Rabobank. Condition ratings of U.S. winter wheat declined in January in several southern U.S. Plains states hit by drought, including top U.S. producer Kansas, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Monday. The USDA rated 14 percent of the Kansas winter wheat crop in good-to-excellent condition, sharply down from 37 percent at the end of December. There is close market attention on the state of U.S. winter wheat, with concern about dryness and cool temperatures in parts of the U.S. Plains in the past few weeks,\" Chong said. \"The market seems to expect the dryness in the U.S. Plains to cause a further deterioration of winter wheat crop ratings and this is reflected in firm prices today. However, the actual impact will not be visible for some time yet. There is also concern that lack of rain in Argentina's soybean belt could reduce the crop in the world's biggest exporter of soymeal. \"Soybeans have been supported recently by fear drought could stress Argentine soybean crops, with soymeal leading the rally, Chong said. Thunderstorms and rainfall in key soy producing regions could hamper harvesting and delay planting of winter corn in some areas of Brazil, one weather forecaster said on Monday. \"There is concern about rain delaying the soybean harvest in Brazil,\" Chong said. \"But conditions in Brazil have been mixed and I think the crop picture overall is pretty good. \"I am expecting a large soybean harvest there of over 110 million tonnes for a second consecutive year. Corn is receiving some spillover support from the strength in wheat, Chong said, adding that there is also attention on the speed of Brazils soybean harvest, with any substantial delays raising the possibility that less corn could be planted after soybeans. \nGrains prices at 1120 GMT \nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 455.25 6.00 +1.34% +10.97% 412.06 80 CBOT corn 359.75 1.00 +0.28% +2.86% 349.12 76 CBOT soy 993.25 1.75 +0.18% -2.65% 995.82 72 CBOT rice $12.41 -$0.03 -0.24% +26.45% $10.10 75 WTI crude $65.04 -$0.52 -0.79% +36.96% $47.97 62 \nCurrencies \nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents\/bushel.

But now everything has changed. \nApple this week confirmed that it will repatriate its nearly quarter-trillion-dollar cash hoard and pay $38 billion in taxes on it. The move will free up the remaining sum to be used for investment in the U.S. But some market watchers believe Apple will use a large portion of the cash on an acquisition (or two). \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter \nMeanwhile, Apple confirmed that it\u2019s planning to open a second campus in the U.S. at some point and it appears to be nearing the release of its long-awaited HomePod smart speaker. \nOverall, it\u2019s been a busy week of speculation about Apple. And we\u2019ll look at all of that in this week\u2019s roundup. \nThis is Fortune \u2019s latest weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news . Here\u2019s last week\u2019s roundup . Apple announced this week plans to repatriate nearly $250 billion in cash from overseas to the U.S. The move will free up that cash, minus taxes, to be used how the company sees fit. Apple said that it will initially invest $30 billion of it in \u201ccapital expenditures\u201d over the next five years. The company will also hire 20,000 new workers over that period. Although Apple didn\u2019t say whether it would make acquisitions this year, longtime company watcher Gene Munster believes it will. In an interview with news site Business Insider, Munster said he thinks Apple will make acquisitions amounting to $5 billion or less . The two companies at the top of Apple\u2019s wishlist, according to Munster: Augmented reality headset maker Magic Leap and luxury fitness company Peloton . In its announcement on repatriating cash, Apple said that it plans to announce a location for a second campus later this year . Apple didn\u2019t say how it would choose its second campus, but speculation has already begun . Apple suppliers have already shipped 1 million HomePods in preparation for the smart speaker\u2019s release within the next four to six weeks, according to a report this week. Apple had planned to release the HomePod in December, but it delayed it in November, saying it needed more time. A report this week said Apple\u2019s HomePod software wasn\u2019t working well enough , leading the company to delay the device\u2019s release. Apple this week said that it will release a fix to a security flaw affecting its Messages text-messaging app . When iPhone or Mac users receive a specific \u201cchaiOS\u201d link, the device will crash, even if the person doesn\u2019t click on the link. The bug doesn\u2019t cause any irreparable harm, but it is annoying. Apple said that it would release a fix next week .

Fundraising in the island city has attracted foreign investors ranging from family offices to corporate backers who want a finger in the technology investment space.\nVickers adopts a largely non-thematic strategy globally but is keen to ride on the growth it sees in biotechnology, nanotechnology and AI, Tan said.\n\u201cIn these three megatrends, if you follow them and invest in them, the growth will be exponential,\u201d he said.\nThe firm closed its fifth fund of $230 million in October. Of that, it has committed to about $130 million in deals and expects another $20 million worth to be closed soon.\n\u201cWe still have some reserves for follow-on investments, and we probably have space for perhaps another seven new deals,\u201d he said.\nBiotechnology is the best-performing sector in Vickers\u2019 portfolio, achieving a multiple of more than 10 times for the firm, Tan said, due largely to an investment five years ago in San Diego-based regenerative medicine technology company Samumed LLC, a unicorn startup valued at $12 billion.\nThe current average valuation multiple across its first four funds is 5.8 times, with a net internal rate of return of 37 percent.\n\u201cAll our life science investments are in the U.S. and U.K. currently, but we plan to invest more in Asia,\u201d he said.\nTan\u2019s investment track record includes China\u2019s Baidu Inc ( BIDU.O ) five years before it went public - a deal he entered as then-head of Asia at DFJ Eplanet Ventures, and which has since become the one he is most recognized for.

In Australia, Rio Tinto and BHP, along with Fortescue Metals Group aim to add about 170 million tonnes of new capacity over the next several years.\nThe forecast price decline will continue into 2019, when the steelmaking raw material will average only $49 a tonne, the department said in its latest commodities outlook paper.\n\u201cThe iron ore price is expected to experience some ongoing volatility in early 2018, as the market responds to uncertainty regarding the impact of winter production restrictions on iron ore demand,\u201d it warned.\nThe lower prices will reflect growing supply from low-cost producers and moderating demand from China, it said.\nChina is in the process of closing ageing, high-polluting steel mills and induction furnaces to curb overcapacity in the sector.\nChina\u2019s President Xi Jinping said in October that fighting pollution was one of the country\u2019s key tasks through 2020.\nAustralia\u2019s liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports are forecast to climb to 76.5 million tonnes in the year to end-June 2019, from 63 million tonnes forecast for the 2017\/18 fiscal year and 52 million tonnes last year.\nBetween 2016\/17 and 2018\/19, LNG should add A$14 billion ($11 billion) to Australia\u2019s export earnings, while iron ore is forecast to subtract A$10 billion, according to the department.\nThe shift follows the construction of $180 billion of new gas projects. The rise in LNG earnings will be underpinned as three remaining projects under construction hit their stride, it said. These are Chevron Corp\u2019s Wheatstone project, Inpex Corp\u2019s Ichthys and Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s Prelude.\nPrices for coking coal, another key steel-making ingredient, are forecast by the department to drift lower over the next eighteen months from last quarter\u2019s benchmark price of $192 a tonne as rising supply more than offsets demand.\nIt also expects thermal coal prices to ease through 2018 and early 2019, with the Newcastle spot price forecast to drop 12 percent to an average $77 a tonne in 2018, and by a further 6 percent to $70 in 2019.\n($1 = 1.2719 Australian dollars)\nReporting by James Regan; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Richard Pullin\n "}

Stuart, a homeless man, sits under a bus shelter where he sleeps opposite Windsor Castle in Windsor, Britain, January 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Toby Melville \nQueen Elizabeth\u2019s grandson Harry and his American actress fiancee are to tie the knot at Windsor Castle, the monarch\u2019s palace to the west of London, in May with thousands of visitors expected to visit the town to celebrate the occasion. \nSimon Dudley, the leader of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead council, wrote on Twitter there had been an \u201cepidemic of rough sleeping and vagrancy\u201d in the town and said he wanted police \u201cto focus on dealing with this before the #RoyalWedding\u201d. \n\u201cThis is creating a concerning and hostile atmosphere for our residents and the seven million tourists who come to Windsor each year,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the local Police and Crime Commissioner Anthony Stansfield. \n\u201cIt is becoming increasingly concerning to see the quantities of bags and detritus that those begging are accumulating and leaving on our pavements, at times unattended, thus presenting a security risk.\u201d \nHis remarks drew criticism from local homeless organizations and even Prime Minister Theresa May. \n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with the comments that the leader of the council has made,\u201d she told BBC TV. Stuart, a homeless man, sits under a bus shelter where he sleeps opposite Windsor Castle in Windsor, Britain, January 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Toby Melville \n\u201cI think it is important that we, councils, work hard to ensure that they are proving accommodation for those people who are homeless, and where there are issues of people aggressively begging on the streets then it\u2019s important that councils work with the police to deal with that aggressive bullying.\u201d \nWindsor, the oldest inhabited castle in the world which has been a home of British monarchs for almost 1,000 years, attracts 1.3 million visitors every year, while many also visit the town to watch the regular \u201cChanging the Guard\u201d ceremony with soldiers in scarlet tunics and bearskin hats parading with an army band. Slideshow (3 Images) \nDudley said the council had invested heavily in support services to help those in need with shelters and emergency accommodation for rough sleepers, adding there was evidence that many of those begging were not in fact homeless. \n\u201cObviously, the level of tourist interest is set to multiply with the Royal Wedding in May 2018,\u201d he wrote, calling for the police to invoke powers such as the 1824 Vagrancy Act to clear the streets. \u201cThe whole situation also presents a beautiful town in a sadly unfavorable light.\u201d \nStansfield said he was surprised the letter had been publicly released, but added the police would be happy to investigate Dudley\u2019s concerns. \nThe Windsor Homelessness Project\u2019s manager Murphy James told the BBC it was \u201csickening\u201d Dudley had cited the royal wedding as a reason for concern. \n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely abhorrent that anybody has got these views in this day and age, especially a lead councillor of the borough,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody is sleeping out on the street, they are not there by choice, they are there because something has gone wrong.\u201d Editing by Stephen Addison"}

And while long positions have skyrocketed, short positions \u2014 or bets that prices will fall \u2014 have dipped to their lowest levels since February in recent weeks. \nThe oil price rally is \"definitely due to massive overheating of the speculators and is likely to correct over the next month,\" Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank, told CNBC on Friday. \n\"(I expect) the price of oil to correct by at least 10 to 15 percent over the coming months because the current fundamentals are not justifying this kind of strength,\" Weinberg said. \nOil prices retreated from their highest level in 2.5 years on Friday as surging U.S. production appeared to offset supply fears stoked by anti-government rallies in Tehran. Brent crude traded at $67.38 a barrel at around 12 p.m. London time (7 a.m. ET), down 1 percent, while U.S. crude was seen at $61.41, down 0.9 percent. Goldman, Morgan Stanley raise 2018 oil price forecasts \nWhile most asset classes recorded gains in 2017, Weinberg said the commodities sector had been held back by a combination of monetary policy decisions and geopolitical factors. Nonetheless, he argued the most important component for commodities at the beginning of 2018 was investment activity. \nSpeculative bets that U.S. crude prices will rise have surged since September as OPEC and 10 other allied producers, including Russia, secured a deal to continue capping their oil production. The agreement has helped to clear a global supply overhang and drain stockpiles of crude oil. Heinz-Peter Bader | Reuters Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih listens during a news conference after an OPEC meeting in Vienna, Austria, November 30, 2017. \nIn December, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both raised their respective oil price forecasts, citing a stronger-than-anticipated OPEC-led commitment to extend output cuts. The cuts, which started in January 2017, are poised to continue through all of 2018. \nThe price of oil collapsed from almost $120 a barrel in June 2014 due to weak demand, a strong dollar and booming U.S. shale production. OPEC's reluctance to cut output was also seen as a key reason behind the fall. But, the oil cartel soon moved to curb production \u2014 along with other oil producing nations \u2014 in late 2016.

He also raised his 2018 and 2019 earnings estimates by 12 cents per share each to $7.05 and $7.65, respectively. \n\"Given McDonald's strong same-store sales momentum, we raise our target multiple on the stock to 27x (from 26x),\" he wrote. The stock's target price is now $190, up from $180. McDonald's shares closed at $172.12 on the last day of trading in 2017, and were up less than 1 percent in midday trading. \nPeter Saleh, an analyst at BTIG, also foresees positive growth for McDonald's and lifted his target price to $200 from $175. \n\"After several years of playing defense, we believe McDonald's is finally returning to an offensive strategy which will yield stronger comp growth and increased market share,\" Saleh wrote in a research note Tuesday. \nSaleh noted that the company's new Dollar Menu, which launches Jan. 4, has an average discount of about 13 percent. This could be a major driver for growth. \nMcDonald's launch of $1 and $2 soft drink and McCaf\u00e9 beverages in April of last year has been cited by the company as part of the reason sales have been strong in recent quarters. He estimates McDonald's U.S. same-store sales could \"remain in the mid-single digits\" in 2018 and beyond. \nOn Tuesday, Saleh bolstered his 2018 same-store sales estimate to 4.1 percent growth, up from 3 percent. He also raised his 2019 same-store sales prediction to a 3.9 percent gain, up from 3.3 percent."}

Film director Roman Polanski arrives at the Madeleine Church to attend a ceremony during a 'popular tribute' to late French singer and actor Johnny Hallyday in Paris, France, December 9, 2017. REUTERS\/Charles Platiau \nThe Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office was investigating an accusation that Polanski, a long-time fugitive from the United States, committed lewd and lascivious acts with a child and sodomy with a minor, but did not proceed because it was beyond the statute of limitations, spokesman Greg Risling said. \nThe office pegged the date as Jan. 1, 1975 and declined to identify Polanski\u2019s accuser. The prosecutor opened the investigation in December. \nThe accuser, who identified herself online as artist Marianne Barnard, accused Polanski, now 84, in October of having molested her when he photographed her as a naked 10-year-old under an open fur coat in a photo shoot arranged by her mother. \n\u201cAfter it happened, I didn\u2019t say anything to anyone,\u201d Barnard said in a post on thepetition.com, where she is seeking signatures urging that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences revoke Polanski\u2019s membership. \nPolanski\u2019s lawyer, Harland Braun, said the incident never happened, adding that because police and prosecutors have stopped looking into the matter, he is pursuing his own investigation in an effort to clear his client. \n\u201cWe have what we believe is a totally fictitious case against Mr. Polanski,\u201d said Braun. \nPolanski in 1977 admitted to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in Los Angeles and spent 42 days in pre-trial custody. He fled the United States the following year, fearing a plea bargain with prosecutors would be overruled and that he would get a lengthy prison term. \nIn November, Swiss prosecutors dropped an investigation of him after finding that the country\u2019s statute of limitations did not allow pursuing allegations by a former German actress and model that he raped her in 1972 when she was 15 years old. \nPolanski won an Academy Award in 2003 for directing \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d \n(This version of the story was corrected to say accusation instead of charge in paragraph two; corrects to make clear Polanski is member of Academy not a board member, paragraph five) Reporting by Peter Szekely in New York; editing by Grant McCool"}

Morgan CEO outlined the positive fundamentals of today's economy, but issued caution over what he saw as major risk areas, speaking during a panel entitled \"The Next Financial Crisis.\" Real interest rates, unlike nominal rates, are adjusted for inflation.\n\"Given asset valuations, given that we've got 4 percent global economic growth, it seems like we're in a pretty good place right now economically. But we've got a monetary policy which still seems like it's in the remnants of the depression era,\" Staley said.\nFinancial markets have been enjoying the benefits of a global growth upswing and prolonged low interest rates 10 years after the 2008 recession, as major indexes like the Dow Jones and S&P 500 continue to hit record highs. While many investors are celebrating the bull run, others caution that historically high stock market valuations combined with rising global debt are a recipe for financial disaster.\n\"If there is going be another financial crisis, my bet is most crises are where we run into something that was totally obvious but we all missed it,\" Staley went on.\n\"There's something out there in the capital markets. Given that equity markets are at an all-time high and volatility is at an all-time low, that's not a sustainable proposition.\"\nThe Barclays chief doesn't think the trigger will come from the banks, however. Referencing the stress tests carried out on banks like Barclays , Staley insisted that the same stress test be applied to the rest of the economy.\n\"Given where our debt levels are, given our exposure to low interest rates, if we do have another economic cycle \u2014 which I would argue we will \u2014 I think the capital markets will be tested.\"\nCheck out the world leaders and celebrities who are at Davos this year Larry Busacca | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images"}

Its exit from the drone business will take place after selling the existing Karma inventory, it added.\nThe company cut the price of its latest HERO6 cameras to $399 from $499 this week, a decision that it said would hurt revenue by around $80 million in the fourth quarter.\nMorgan Stanley said in a research note on Monday that the price cut would make earnings growth difficult in fiscal 2018.\nThe move followed weak demand for existing camera models.\n\u201cDespite significant marketing support, we found consumers were reluctant to purchase HERO5 Black at the same price it launched at one year earlier,\u201d Chief Executive Nick Woodman said in a statement alongside results.\nThe company now expects fourth-quarter revenue of $340 million, compared with its November projection of $470 million, plus or minus $10 million.

They keep their nights and weekends sacred and still get more done than people who work 10 or 20 hours more per week than they do.\nA new study from Stanford shows that they are on to something.\nMore from Travis Bradberry: \n10 silly things you do that make you less likable \n5 signs you're much smarter than average \n9 signs you're successful\u2014even if it doesn't feel like it \nThe study found that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that there's no point in working any more.That's right, people who work as much as 70 hours (or more) per week actually get the same amount done as people who work 55 hours.\n\"Time is what we want most, but what we use worst.\" -William Penn\nSmart people know the importance of shifting gears on the weekend to relaxing and rejuvenating activities. They use their weekends to create a better week ahead.\nThis is easier said than done, so here's some help. The following are some things that you can do to find balance on the weekend and come into work at 110 percent on Monday morning.\nshow chapters Real Estate moguls share a common mistake to avoid when flipping a home      1:00 PM ET Fri, 31 March 2017 | 00:51 Disconnect Disconnecting is the most important weekend strategy, because if you can't find a way to remove yourself electronically from your work Friday evening through Monday morning, then you've never really left work. Making yourself available to your work 24\/7 exposes you to a constant barrage of stressors that prevent you from refocusing and recharging.\nIf taking the entire weekend off handling work e-mails and calls isn't realistic, try designating specific times on Saturday and Sunday for checking e-mails and responding to voicemails. For example, check your messages on Saturday afternoon while your kids are getting a haircut and on Sunday evenings after dinner. Scheduling short blocks of time will alleviate stress without sacrificing availability.\nMinimize chores Chores have a funny habit of completely taking over your weekends. When this happens, you lose the opportunity to relax and reflect. What's worse is that a lot of chores feel like work, and if you spend all weekend doing them, you just put in a seven-day workweek. To keep this from happening, you need to schedule your chores like you would anything else during the week, and if you don't complete them during the allotted time, you move on and finish them the following weekend.\nExercise No time to exercise during the week? You have 48 hours every weekend to make it happen. Getting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a soothing neurotransmitter that reduces stress. Exercise is also a great way to come up with new ideas. Innovators and other successful people know that being outdoors often sparks creativity. I know that a lot of my best ideas come to me while I'm surfing.\nWhile you're out in the ocean, the combination of invigorating activity and beautiful scenery creates the perfect environment for an influx of creativity. Whether you're running, cycling, or gardening, exercise leads to endorphin-fueled introspection. The key is to find a physical activity that does this for you and then to make it an important part of your weekend routine.\nReflect Weekly reflection is a powerful tool for improvement. Use the weekend to contemplate the larger forces that are shaping your industry, your organization, and your job. Without the distractions of Monday to Friday busy work, you should be able to see things in a whole new light. Use this insight to alter your approach to the coming week, improving the efficiency and efficacy of your work.\nPursue a passion You might be surprised what happens when you pursue something you're passionate about on weekends. Indulging your passions is a great way to escape stress and to open your mind to new ways of thinking. Things like playing music, reading, writing, painting, or even playing catch with your kids can help stimulate different modes of thought that can reap huge dividends over the coming week.\nshow chapters Challenging her boss helped Xerox's Ursula Burns rise through the ranks      11:39 AM ET Wed, 29 March 2017 | 00:57 Spend quality time with family Spending quality time with your family on the weekend is essential if you want to recharge and relax. Weekdays are so hectic that the entire week can fly by with little quality family time. Don't let this bleed into your weekends. Take your kids to the park, take your spouse to his or her favorite restaurant, and go visit your parents. You'll be glad you did.\nSchedule micro-adventures Buy tickets to a concert or play, or get reservations for that cool new hotel that just opened downtown. Instead of running on a treadmill, plan a hike. Try something you haven't done before or perhaps something you haven't done in a long time.\nStudies show that anticipating something good to come is a significant part of what makes the activity pleasurable. Knowing that you have something interesting planned for Saturday will not only be fun come Saturday, but it will significantly improve your mood throughout the week.\nWake up at the same time It's tempting to sleep in on the weekend to catch up on your sleep. Though it feels good temporarily, having an inconsistent wake-up time disturbs your circadian rhythm. Your body cycles through an elaborate series of sleep phases in order for you to wake up rested and refreshed.\nOne of these phases involves preparing your mind to be awake and alert, which is why people often wake up just before their alarm clock goes off (the brain is trained and ready). When you sleep past your regular wake-up time on the weekend, you end up feeling groggy and tired. This isn't just disruptive to your day off, it also makes you less productive on Monday because your brain isn't ready to wake up at your regular time. If you need to catch up on sleep, just go to bed earlier.\nshow chapters The smart strategies Jay-Z\u2019s built a massive business with      11:41 AM ET Fri, 30 June 2017 | 01:22 Designate mornings as me time It can be difficult to get time to yourself on the weekends, especially if you have family. Finding a way to engage in an activity you're passionate about first thing in the morning can pay massive dividends in happiness and cleanliness of mind. It's also a great way to perfect your circadian rhythm by forcing yourself to wake up at the same time you do on weekdays.

The move to pressure miners follows China's shutdown of local bitcoin exchanges and its ban on initial coin offerings.\nMiners create new bitcoins by solving complex maths problems whose solutions are used to validate new bitcoin transactions. Though ostensibly a computational task, the reliance on raw computing power makes the process more akin to industrial manufacturing than traditional high-technology businesses.\nMany bitcoin miners have established operations in remote areas without even registering a company. Some have also skirted Chinese regulations that forbid end users from purchasing electricity directly from power producers rather than grid operators.\nReceive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1 .\nChina mines about three-quarters of the world's bitcoins, according to Liao Xiang, chief executive of Lightningasic, a Shenzhen-based mining operation. Chinese miners have taken advantage of cheap electricity in regions rich in coal or hydroelectric power , including Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan and Yunnan.\nThe global industry accounts for 0.17 per cent of global electricity consumption, more than 161 individual countries, according to Digiconomist, a website that tracks the industry.\nChina's government is using state investment and an array of industrial policies in an effort to seize global leadership in strategic technology sectors such as artificial intelligence and robotics. But the crackdown on bitcoin miners reflects a judgment that cryptocurrencies do not merit state support.\nBitcoin mining \"consumes a large amount of electricity and also encourages a spirit of speculation in 'virtual currencies'\", according to the document. Mining operations contradict efforts to prevent financial risk and to discourage activities that \"deviate from the needs of the real economy\", it added.\nThe internet finance task force, which includes the People's Bank of China, has previously led regulatory tightening efforts on peer-to-peer lending and online consumer loans.\nThe order does not call on regional authorities to shut mining operations directly, but rather to squeeze them out by strictly enforcing policies on electricity consumption, land use, tax collection and environmental regulation.\nThe PBoC did not respond to a request for comment.\nChinese miners are now seeking ways to transfer their operations abroad, either by physically moving factories or selling their expertise. Cheap electricity and a cool climate, which helps prevent computers from overheating, are the main requirements. Canada, Iceland, eastern Europe and Russia are seen as the most promising destinations.\nIndustry participants say China was in any case never an especially suitable location for mining, even after accounting for electricity costs in selected regions that are lower than the national average. China's current dominance is mainly due to its well-developed supply chains for computer components used in the mining process.\n\"The difficulty is that setting up in other countries takes time and capital to build large-scale data centres,\" said Mr Liao. \"It needs so much electricity. A typical industrial park doesn't meet the requirements.\"\nMore from the Financial Times:\nWhat happened when I gave bitcoin as presents\nTelegram to hop on cryptocurrency bandwagon with ICO offering\nGrowing number of cryptocurrencies spark concerns"}

The SPD leadership is due to recommend on Friday whether or not to start talks, and it is then up to an SPD party congress on Jan. 21 to make a decision.\nNot so grand? A coalition between Merkel's CDU\/CSU alliance - which lost ground to the AfD in September's ballot - and the SPD has governed Germany for eight of the last 12 years.\nBut it has tended to be viewed as a last resort by both politicians and voters as it leaves the opposition weak.\nA poll for broadcaster ARD showed more than half of the electorate - 52 percent - are sceptical about reviving it, while 45 percent are in favour.\nSlideshow (9 Images)\nNot natural allies, the two camps are likely to clash on immigration, tax, healthcare and Europe - and expectations among other leading figures in the parties were mixed as the preliminary talks got under way.\nNorbert Roemer, SPD head in the regional assembly of North Rhine-Westphalia, told the RND newspaper group no lawmakers in his state caucus favoured a grand coalition - unlike five years ago - with past experience meaning they no longer trusted Merkel.\nVolker Bouffier, a senior member of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), told Rheinische Post newspaper his party intended to form a grand coalition but that it could not come at any price.\nHorst Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party to Merkel's CDU - said he was going into the talks in \"high spirits\" and participants needed to come to an agreement.\nThe potential partners have agreed on a news blackout during the exploratory talks, which are due to finish on Thursday.\nIf they find enough common ground and the SPD gets backing from its members in a vote, the parties will proceed to full-blown coalition talks. The consensus among politicians and observers expect those would last until at least March.\nBut if the discussions fail, Germany could either face fresh elections or, for the first time in the post-war era, a minority government run by Merkel."}

Generally when people are very happy and confident, something wrong happens,\" Rubenstein cautioned at the Bloomberg-moderated panel.\n\"I am nervous that the conventional wisdom is that we have no recession problems around the world, that everybody's doing quite well ... The conventional wisdom is usually wrong, and it might be in this case.\"\nThe American businessman and philanthropist went on to explain why debt and geopolitics are further sources of concern.\nshow chapters David Rubenstein: I think we'd be lucky and happy to get close to 3 percent GDP 10:17 AM ET Tue, 23 Jan 2018 | 01:00 \"I do worry that governments have a little bit too much debt, and maybe they have too many entitlement programs they're ultimately not going to be able to honor. At some point, people are going to wake up and say the U.S. government has $20 trillion dollars of debt and unfunded liabilities that are hard to fathom.\"\nTrepidation over mounting global debt is not new; numerous CEOs and finance officials have cited greater leverage across both emerging and advanced economies as among the greatest threats to global economic stability.\nRubenstein continued, \"I worry about geopolitical things we can't anticipate, the so-called black swans,\" suggesting a slew of potential threats from a \"9\/11 type event\" to pandemics and conflicts involving Iran, Russia and China.\nMeanwhile, the CEO of Bank Pekao, Poland's second-largest bank, made a similar warning about what he believed to be a sort of oblivious optimism.\n\"Obviously there are many reasons to be optimistic -- the U.S. economy is growing fast, positive IMF outlook, emerging markets are growing fast,\" Pekao's Michal Krupinski told CNBC Wednesday.\n\"The problem is that once you're not able to find an imbalance in the global economy, you should always be aware of what is the weakest link. This makes me worried.\"\n\"Secondly, we have unprecedented actions from central banks,\" he added, referring to central banks' prolonged quantitative easing policies. \"The drug will be cut one day, and we're facing lots of structural problems.\"\nA common theme at Davos, and indeed over the past several months among investors, is whether the current skyrocketing growth of market valuations and increased capital flows are a harbinger of the next crash .

{"published":"2018-01-02T08:00:00.000+02:00","title":"Five Big Business Trends to Watch in 2018 | Fortune","text":"By Alan Murray 6:00 AM EST \nAfter a restful holiday break I\u2019m ready for what is sure to be an eventful New Year. \nHere are five big business trends I\u2019ll be watching: \n1: Recession Watch. Apologies for being contrary; all signs point to a solid economy in 2018, with tax cuts boosting growth. But that\u2019s precisely the reason to start worrying. The economic expansion is eight and a half years old, and this spring, it becomes the second longest on record. Unemployment is at all-time lows in 13 states . Wages are (finally) starting to rise. As a result, there\u2019s a steadily growing danger that something will happen to end the streak\u2014a spike in interest rates powered by the Fed; a collapse in the stock market caused by a re-valuation of tech companies; a trade war sparked by the President; or a nuclear standoff with Kim Jong-un, to name a few. None of these, by themselves, is a likely event; but together they represent an impressive flock of potential black swans circling an aging economic expansion. \n2: AI advances. 2017 was the year AI leapt to the forefront of CEO consciousness. 2018 may be the year that the hype starts to become reality. At CEO Daily, we believe the explosion of connected devices spewing out data that can be transformed into intelligence by ever smarter machine-learning algorithms eventually will spark a new industrial revolution. But we also recognize there are long and variable lags. If you missed this smart piece by Greg Ip of the Wall Street Journal last week, take time to read it now. A belated burst of business productivity in 2018, if it happened, could help prolong the expansion and provide a much-needed boost to living standards. \n3: The tech backlash builds. Expect to see this on multiple fronts in 2018, as retailers worry about Amazon\u2019s growing dominance, media companies struggle in the Facebook-Google-Netflix vice grip, Congress continues its quest for information on how Russia, ISIS and other bad actors benefit from social networks, and concerns about cyber security and data privacy grow. One area to watch is antitrust enforcement, where the government\u2019s suit to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger could presage a new approach to vertical integration that could ultimately threaten the FAANG firms. \n4: The CEO Statesman is on the rise. For a host of reasons, CEOs are increasingly taking on social issues. Driving the trend: socially-conscious millennial workers, ineffective governments, and the need to build public trust in business. Expect to see more CEOs stepping up in 2018 . With the labor market tight, they need to show that their companies are doing good in the world to attract the best talent. \n5: A changing workplace for women. The #MeToo movement has caused an abrupt shift in acceptable workplace behavior. Some worry that could result in a backlash, but I\u2019m betting 2018 will mark a turning point for women in the workplace. \nThis essay was originally published in CEO Daily, Fortune\u2019s morning newsletter for must-read business news.

It lists an Eylea biosimilar at the preclinical stage on its pipeline chart, putting it behind the Momenta\/Mylan candidate. \nEylea, which treats a leading cause of blindness in the elderly - wet age-related macular degeneration - and related eye conditions, accounts for most of Regeneron\u2019s revenue. \nRegeneron shares fell 1.5 percent to $388 in extended trading. Momenta shares rose 6 percent to $15, while Mylan shares were unchanged from their Nasdaq close at $43.14. \nU.S. Eylea sales rose 12 percent in the third quarter to $953 million. Sales outside the United States, which are booked by Bayer AG, rose 20 percent in the most recently reported quarter. Global sales in 2016 exceeded $5 billion. \nEylea is also approved to treat macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema. \nThe proposed trial of the biosimilar, currently called M710, will be in patients with diabetic macular edema and compare the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity with Eylea. \nUnlike generic versions of traditional pills, it is not possible to produce exact copies of complex biotech medicines made from living cells, thus the term biosimilar. Proposed biosimilars must prove themselves to be close enough to the original drug to satisfy regulators. Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Susan Thomas"}

You may have thought last year's soaring FANG valuations (Facebook +53%, Amazon +56%, Netflix +55%, and Google +33%) meant they were headed for an inevitable fall in 2018. But Mr. Market disagrees.\nNetflix saw the biggest rise yesterday--up 4.7%--fueled partly by an analyst report saying it was \u201cfar ahead of peers\u201d in building subscription video services, and also by unsubstantiated rumors that it could be bought by Apple , which could use it's stash of overseas earnings that have been liberated by the new tax bill. Chipmakers also had a big day, with Advanced Micro Devices up 6.8%, Micron Technology up 6.2%, and Nvidia up 3%.\nThe markets seem to believe the FANG companies will continue their march toward world domination. Amazon, in particular, seems unstoppable. The company said in a press release yesterday that it shipped over 5 billion items from its Prime membership service to subscribers in 2017. One analyst predicted Amazon would buy Target Corp. this year--following its purchase of Whole Foods last year.\nMeanwhile, betting markets are saying Atlanta and Austin lead the odds of becoming Amazon's new, second headquarters--an honor that could bring as many as 50,000 high paying jobs with it.\nSeparately, I noted yesterday that the putatively strong economy had an impressive number of black swans circling it.

The New York Times \nPeter Thiel is betting big on Bitcoin. \nThe billionaire Silicon Valley investor's Founders Fund venture capital firm reportedly bought anywhere from $15 million to $20 million worth of the cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin's recent surge has pushed the value of that investment into the \"hundreds of millions.\" Of course, cryptocurrency's volatile nature has many investors concerned about a Bitcoin bubble, but Thiel said earlier this year that people are \"underestimating\" the cryptocurrency. The Wall Street Journal \nNasdaq tops 7,000 as stocks start 2018 on a strong note. \nTKTKTKIt didn't take long for Wall Street's first record-setting day of the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed above 7,000 points for the first time ever, gaining almost 1.5%, on the first day of trading in 2018. Big tech stocks like Apple and Netflix pushed the Nasdaq to its personal best finish, while the S&P 500 also closed at an all-time high on Tuesday.

{"published":"2018-01-16T15:33:00.000+02:00","title":"Brainstorm Health: Universal Flu Vaccine, Merck Lung Cancer Drug, UnitedHealth Earnings | Fortune","text":"1:33 PM EST \nHello, readers! This is Sy. \nGoogle parent Alphabet\u2019s venture arm GV (formerly Google Ventures) is among the companies backing U.K. biotech Vaccitech , which has set out to achieve one of medicine\u2019s most-sought milestones: developing a universal flu vaccine . The company has drawn in $27 million in new funding to help, in part, fund large clinical trials of its vaccine as the most widespread flu season in at least a dozen years rages in the U.S. \nThe 2018 flu season is already so deadly that it\u2019s stretching hospital resources to the breaking point in states like California. In fact, Dan Jernigan, director of the influenza division at the national Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, says this flu season represents \u201cthe first year we have had the entire continental U.S. be the same color on the [flu tracking] graph, meaning there is widespread activity in all of the continental U.S. at this point.\u201d Public health officials say the flu outbreak may be peaking right now; but since flu season can last into May, millions of more people may get sick (and tens or hundreds of thousands more hospitalized) before all is said and done. The dominant H3N2 strain of the flu going around in 2018 is a particularly nasty one, especially for older Americans, and several more strains like H1N1 are expected to arise within the next few months. \nPart of what makes outbreaks like the 2018 flu season so difficult to control is the imperfection of current flu vaccination methods. This year\u2019s vaccine may only be about 30% to 40% effective (although public health officials still strongly urge all Americans who can to get a flu shot , no matter how late into the season). In any given year, flu vaccine effectiveness ranges from about 40% to 60%. And a major factor is that scientists must try to predict which strains of the flu will be most dominant months ahead of peak flu, since millions of vaccine doses need to be created in time for the fall. Their projections, however educated, aren\u2019t always correct. And the flu virus itself can always evolve. \nA universal flu vaccine would theoretically address this problem by attacking the parts of the influenza virus which don\u2019t change over time. That\u2019s what Vaccitech, which was founded by Oxford University scientists, is attempting to do with its vaccine technology\u2014attack proteins at the flu virus\u2019 core rather than the dynamic ones on its surface and stimulate immune T-cells rather than antibodies. The universal vaccine is moving into mid-stage trials, which means successful studies could lead to a commercial launch by the mid-2020s, according to Vaccitech CEO Tom Evans. \nRead on for the day\u2019s news. Sy Mukherjee @the_sy_guy DIGITAL HEALTH \nCould AI detect cardiac arrest through the phone? A small, early stage study in Copenhagen suggests that artificial intelligence may be better able to recognize cardiac arrest through descriptions over the phone better than human dispatchers can. According to the study, the AI (which uses machine learning to improve its understanding of sounds, including non-verbal and involuntary noises such as irregular breathing) was able to correctly identify cardiac arrest 95% of the time while dispatchers were able to 73% of the time. ( Fast Company ) INDICATIONS \nMerck\u2019s star cancer drug strikes again in lung cancer. Shares of pharmaceutical giant Merck soared 7% in Tuesday trading as a late-stage clinical trial showed that its flagship cancer immunotherapy treatment, Keytruda, helped lung cancer patients live longer when combined with two chemotherapy drugs as a \u201cfirst-line\u201d treatment (i.e., the first set of treatments given to a patient). Merck actually already secured U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for Keytruda plus chemotherapy as a first-line lung cancer treatment; the reason investors are so enthusiastic about the latest data is that it significantly boosts the company\u2019s chances of a similar approval in Europe, where regulators had requested more information. ( Reuters ) THE BIG PICTURE \nUninsurance rate rises in 2017 for first time in years. It\u2019s official: the number of uninsured Americans ballooned by 3.2 million in 2017, the first annual increase in the uninsurance rate since the key provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) aka Obamacare went into effect in 2014, according to Gallup. The uninsured rate stood at 12.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017; that\u2019s a significant rise from the 10.9% rate Gallup found at the end of 2016 (other surveys have indicated the rate fell to below 10% for the first time in 2016). The uninsured rate could increase even more over 2018 as states begin implementing major changes to Medicaid, such as work requirements, recently cleared by the Trump administration. ( NBC News ) \nUnitedHealth shares spike on profit jump. Health insurance giant UnitedHealth\u2019s stock rose about 2.5% in Tuesday trading after the company offered a sharp rise in its 2018 earning per share outlook and a doubling of profit thanks to a one-time tax gain from corporate tax cuts.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite posted their best first four days of a year in more than a decade, while the S&P 500 hit its best level since 2010.\nAccording to one market watcher, the momentum will continue for the markets \u2014 but not without some difficulty.\nA few midyear uncertainties could cause an upset on Wall Street, predicted Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, who is targeting 3,000 for the S&P 500 by year's end.\n\"We think potentially there will be a barbell shape to this year,\" Orlando told CNBC's \" Futures Now \" in an interview this week. \"We could hit an air pocket in the summer and then we should end the summer on a high note.\"\nOrlando's \"barbell\" prediction strays from the pattern set in 2017, when markets booked new records on a mostly straight upward track. Last year, Wall Street boasted an impressive list of accomplishments: It was year eight in this bull market, its second-longest in history.\nThe Dow smashed through 20,000 last January, and scored 71 record closes over the next 12 months \u2014 its most ever and a level it had not come close to since 1995. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rose nearly 20 percent and the Nasdaq almost 30 percent, their best annual gains since 2013.\nThe Fed factor Getty Images Chairman of the Federal Reserve nominee Jerome Powell testifies during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee November 28, 2017 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. The two potential disruptors to the bull market, according to Orlando, are a Federal Reserve in transition and a potential Democratic wave building toward the 2018 midterm elections.\nThe first catalyst is the shakeup in leadership at the Fed, when President Donald Trump 's new chair pick, Jerome Powell , assumes the seat on Feb. 3. Powell takes over from a historically dovish Janet Yellen , who has overseen the steady return to normalized monetary policy over the past two years, after the 2008 crisis saw the central bank pump trillions of dollars into the economy.\n\"How does this leadership transition go?\" Orlando asked rhetorically. \"What will Chairman Powell's transition be in terms of maintaining the same dovish stance [on] quantitative tightening and increases in the funds rate?\"\nUnder Powell, a sudden rise in inflation or too much stimulus from tax reform could force the Fed's hand in raising rates at a pace far quicker than markets anticipate.\nOrlando also pointed to the potential for Democrats to assume the majority in the House and Senate this year, which may put the brakes on Trump's business-friendly agenda. The unraveling of business regulation and cuts to the corporate tax rate provided much of the fuel to markets over the past twelve months.\nThis year, Orlando's prediction for the S&P 500 to end 2018 at 3,000 implies a roughly 12 percent increase from its 2017 close. That's a healthy gain for any normal year of a bull market, but nearly half the gains seen last year.\nAt least for now, U.S. equities are well on track to continue last year's trends. So far this year, the Dow has cleared its never-before-seen 25,000 level and the S&P 500 has surpassed 2,700. This as the S&P has gone 293 days without a 3 percent pullback, its longest streak in history.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

Financial markets are rather nervous it seems to me.\u201d \nLeft and right parties in Italy have supported each other in power previously, but both have ruled out publicly any grand coalition in March if no clear winner emerges. \nBerlusconi met the leaders of his rightist allies the Northern League and Brothers of Italy on Sunday at which they agreed the broad outlines of a joint programme. \nThis included a pledge to double minimum pensions to 1,000 euros (\u00a3886) per month, cut taxes, increase controls on immigration, seek fewer constraints from the European Union and revise a recent pension reform that hiked retirement ages. \nParties across the spectrum are pledging to change or abolish European Union budget rules, slash taxes and spend more to boost the economy which is slowly recovering from recession. \nForza Italia promotes itself as the most moderate force on the right, while the PD, led by former prime minister Matteo Renzi, presents itself as more responsible than its rivals. \nAsked about proposals to introduce a flat tax rate, Padoan said the 15-percent rate suggested by the far-right Northern League was not sustainable, while Berlusconi\u2019s suggestion of a figure around 20 percent was \u201cless unsustainable.\u201d \n\u201cI would explore a tax reform that would simplify the tax rates reducing them to one or, better, two.

It did so after the shooting and results showed the slogan still resonated with people.\n\"We went back out and we weren't sure where visitors would be with the mindset around 'What happens here, stays here,'\" she said. \"What we heard from our research was that people wanted their Vegas back.\"\nThe ad shows a scientist getting in a time-traveling machine and arriving at the Las Vegas Strip in 2018 in front of the Bellagio casino-hotel fountains. He is shown dining, partying at a nightclub and taking part in a pool party at Caesars Palace casino-hotel before going back in time still holding a cocktail.\nNetworks airing the ad include Travel Channel, Food Network and USA.\nOn Oct. 1, a high-stakes gambler killed 58 people and injured hundreds more after he shattered the windows of his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino and unleashed gunfire on a country music festival below before killing himself.\nThe agency immediately put the \"What happens here\" motto on hold and went to work creating a new pitch.\nA spot featured a cityscape and the voice of Las Vegas native and retired tennis star Andre Agassi. \"What is strength?\" Agassi asked, playing off the #VegasStrong slogan that exploded on Twitter. \"Strength is valet parkers who become medics, mothers who become emergency responders.\"\nA TV ad that followed and aired on several networks, including ESPN, Fox Sports and Bravo, featured real-life social media messages posted after the shooting.\nThe destination saw monthly declines in visitation from June through November.

Were working hard on the farm bill and I think its going to go well. \nIn May Trump angered farm groups, which represent the rural voters who generally support his Republican Party, when he proposed cutting $46.54 billion in federal agricultural funding, mostly by capping the amount the government chips in toward crop insurance. There currently is no limit to the support the government gives farmers for insurance premiums. \nTrump, who swept Tennessee in the 2016 election, also signed an executive order after the speech to make it easier for the private sector to locate broadband infrastructure on federal land and buildings, part of a push to expand high-speed internet in rural America. \nTrump signed a memorandum directing the Interior Department to support rural broadband development by increasing access to tower facilities managed by the department, the White House said. \nFaster internet speeds in rural areas are often considered key to addressing the economic divide between rural and urban America, but the costs have so far been prohibitive. \nAbout 39 percent of rural Americans lack access to high- speed internet service, the Federal Communications Commission said in a 2016 report. \n\"We need to get rural America more connected. We need it for our tractors, we need it for our schools, we need it for our home-based businesses,\" a White House official told reporters ahead of Trump's speech. \nThe White House described the moves as an incremental step to help spur private development while the administration figures out how it can help with funding, something that could become part of Trump's plan to invest in infrastructure. \nThe CEO of the leading telecommunications trade group in the country, Jonathan Spalter, said USTelecom would push to ensure the government sets aside money for helping build and upgrade network infrastructure, as well as dismantling and streamlining regulations.

Migrants, part of a group intercepted aboard a dinghy off the coast in the Mediterranean Sea, look on as they stand on a rescue boat upon arrival on Christmas day at the port of Malaga, Spain December 25, 2017. REUTERS\/Jon Nazca \nTwo years after more than a million people entered the EU, mostly fleeing war in the Middle East and poverty in Africa, the IOM recorded 171,635 arrivals by boat in 2017. The 2016 figure was 363,504. \nThe biggest influx of refugees and migrants in Europe since World War Two caused a political and humanitarian crisis two years ago. \nSince then, the main Eastern Mediterranean route between Turkey and Greece has largely been shut by a deal between the EU and Ankara. \nReducing traffic has been slower on the other main route, across the central Mediterranean from North Africa to Italy, where thousands of people have died at sea. But numbers finally started coming down sharply in the second half of last year. \nArrivals by boat in Italy accounted for most of the 2017 arrivals: 119,310 in total, down by a third compared to the previous year, the Italian Interior Ministry said on Dec 31. \n\u201cWe can tell you with confidence that the numbers from North Africa to Italy this year are under 120,000...That\u2019s the lowest in the last four years for arrivals in Italy,\u201d IOM spokesman Joel Millman told a news briefing. \n\u201cThe same can be said for the arrivals in Greece with 29,595 for 2017, absolutely the lowest in the four years we have been keeping numbers on Greece,\u201d he said. In 2016, some 173,614 migrants arrived by sea in Greece, according to IOM figures. \nSome 21,663 migrants arrived in Spain as of Dec. 28 last year, while 1,067 landed in Cyprus, preliminary figures show. \nMore patrols and rescues off the coast of Libya, as well as fighting between smuggling groups, contributed to the overall drop, Millman said. \nThe number of migrant deaths at sea has not been finalised, but stands at 3,116, compared to 5,143 recorded in 2016, Millman said. \n\u201cWe think of those as extremely positive developments,\u201d he said. \nAfrican migrants in Libya continue to depart for Europe from the coast, where the IOM is monitoring rescues, he said, adding: \u201cBoats are still rescuing in the hundreds every day, depending on the day, sub-Saharan Africans who have come through Libya.\u201d \nNearly 20,000 Africans went home last year under IOM\u2019s voluntary repatriation programme from Libya, including 7,000 since an African Union - European Union agreement reached in Abidjan on Nov. 29, Millman said. \nThe United Nations agency aims to repatriate a further 15,000 migrants from Libya by the end of January, he told Reuters.

But the latest of them was impossible to miss: The Wall Street Journal's blockbuster report revealing that then-candidate Donald Trump paid a former porn star hush money to cover up their affair .\nThe story has spawned a flurry of other reports about Trump and porn star Stormy Daniels, (real name Stephanie Clifford), complete with particularly salacious and embarrassing details for everyone involved.\nAll of this begs a two-part question: Will this story cause any real political harm to Trump, and why hasn't it really hurt him already?\nThe answer to the first part of the question is: \"No.\"\nThe answer to the second part is: \"See the answer to the first part.\"\nThere are two reasons for these answers. First, there is no alleged crime here. If Clifford had been paid off with direct campaign funds, then that would be a problem. But the Journal report says the money allegedly paid to Clifford came from the Trump Organization.\nSecond, America's left, right, and middle no longer seem all that sensitive to consensual sex \"scandals.\"\n\"The religious right in America has clearly decided to overlook Trump's personal failings and history in return for his backing on key social issues.\" Revelations of consensual extramarital affairs are hardly an Achilles heel in politics anymore. The fact that President Bill Clinton weathered the Lewinsky scandal and saw his peak approval ratings at the height of the scandal proved that beyond any doubt.\nBut what about the crucial Republican Evangelical voting base? Couldn't or shouldn't this be a killer for them?\nThere, too, the answer is \"no.\" That's because the religious right in America has clearly decided to overlook Trump's personal failings and history in return for his backing on key social issues.\nBefore anyone starts throwing the word \"hypocrisy\" around or feeling all too sure that Christian groups are ditching their supposed principles, remember what's happened to Evangelicals over just the last few years.\nThey've been called hate mongers and they face threats of financial retaliation for refusing to agree with the Supreme Court's decision to legalize gay marriage. They took enormous criticism for supporting North Carolina's now-overturned transgender bathroom law .\nAnd it's not just gay issues. Abortion and contraceptive laws are also a sore spot. Remember the Obama administration pulled out all the stops to fight the Little Sisters of the Poor as that Catholic organization sued to be exempt from providing contraceptive care to its employees under the Affordable Care Act.\nTo say that the religious right in America often feels under siege for a variety of reasons is an understatement.\nEnter Donald Trump. He was by no means the Evangelicals' favorite GOP primary candidate at the start of the 2016 election process. But he was able to win them over with his statements about abortion and the crucial release of his top choices for Supreme Court justice just as he was about to clinch the number of delegates to win the Republican nomination. Then he chose Evangelical favorite Mike Pence as his running mate. And even though he spoke out for gay rights at his convention acceptance speech in July of 2016, it was clear by then that Trump had won over the religious right.\nThis was true even though Trump was already a twice-divorced man, known for sexual promiscuity, and exhibiting a public persona that's a far cry from textbook Christian humility. It stayed true through the Access Hollywood audiotape scandal.\nOn Election Day, the Evangelical loyalty to Trump was clearer than ever. He won 81 percent of the Evangelical vote according to Gallup. That was a greater percentage of that vote than George W. Bush, John McCain, or Mitt Romney captured.\nIn return, those Evangelicals can hardly be disappointed in Trump's policies. He nominated and helped push through the confirmation of conservative judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He's cut the guts out of Obamacare by repealing the individual coverage mandate in the tax reform law. He's rolled back contraceptive requirements for employers, and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is now pushing for religious practices in the workplace.\nJust this week, the White House also announced it would create a new office to protect the religious rights of health care providers, including those who oppose abortions.\nQuid pro quo is in full effect when it comes to Trump and religious voters.\nIt's those religious voters who are the only ones left in America likely to really object to the president's 10-year-old affair with a porn star. Sure, this story is going to grab some nice ratings and millions of clicks. But with no key voting group flipping its support for Trump because of it, this is just another \"Storm\" that's going to pass.\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

In fact, Macron appeared as \"perhaps the leader of Europe at this very moment\" said Philippe le Corre, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. \nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May , who herself has a China trip set for the end of January, continues to face questions about Brexit and her own leadership; Germany's Angela Merkel is struggling to form a coalition; and the U.S. is facing political turmoil under Donald Trump's administration. \nFor his part, Macron is \"clearly eyeing\" a \"special strategic partnership\" with China, said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at French bank Natixis, pointing to China's consumers grow hungrier for what France has to offer. \nDuring his campaign, the French leader took a \"slightly negative\" approach to China by pushing for a European-level investment protection agency, but that development seems to have lost ground, Garcia-Herrero said. \nInstead, Macron appears to be taking a different angle with China. \n\"Macron seems to have come to the realization that he had better be on the right side of the table under China's divide and conquer strategy in Europe, i.e. a more accommodating stance towards China,\" she wrote. \nAs much as Macron is wooing China, Beijing is also reaching out to Europe through its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative that aims to connect Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa with a vast logistics and transport network. \nFor China, France's pivot to closer ties could be beneficial for its overall standing in Europe: A \"divide and conquer\" strategy will help diversify its power, as sentiment toward the East Asian giant turns sour in Germany, Garcia-Herrero added. \nThat shift comes as China is now producing more of its own machinery and automobiles instead of importing them from countries like Germany \u2014 and it's now even competing with the European powerhouse in third markets, she said. Mark Schiefelbein | AFP | Getty Images French President Emmanuel Macron (L) and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands after a joint press briefing at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 9, 2018. Macron pursued business, downplayed deals \nOver his three-day visit, Macron pursued business interests with China, but he also pushed for a reciprocal trading relationship. \nThat came as many in Europe are debating about the implications of Chinese investments in the continent, particularly in infrastructure and higher technology. \n\"At the end of the day, Europe is very open. It's more open than the Chinese market itself. Reciprocity is the key word, really. That's what Emmanuel Macron was trying as a message to convey to [Chines President] Xi Jinping ,\" le Corre told CNBC. \nOn Tuesday, Macron offered to open France to Chinese investment in exchange for greater access to China's markets for French companies, Reuters reported . \n\"We have an access to markets which is unbalanced, unsatisfying,\" Macron told members of the French and Chinese business community at an event in Beijing, Reuters reported . \n\"If we don't deal with this responsibly, the first, natural, reaction will be to close up on both sides,\" he said. \"Let's open up both instead.\" \nOn Wednesday, Macron said a contract with China for 184 Airbus A320s would be finalized soon, Reuters reported. \nThe French leader downplayed the lack of other big deals during his visit, saying other countries had trumpeted big figures in the past that masked more modest realities. \n\u2014Reuters contributed to this report."}

The eagle came during a mammoth drive on the 433-yard hole that saw the ball stop just inches from the cup. \nJohnson said the key to his victory was a new driver he decided to put into play last week. \n\u201cI started hitting it real straight and controlled it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe driver is what won me the golf tournament this week. I don\u2019t think I hit a bad drive all week.\u201d Spain\u2019s Jon Rahm shot a four-under-par 69 and finished second at 16-under.

The deadliest, a bombing at a concert in the northern city of Manchester, killed 22 people.\nFollowing the second bridge attack, Prime Minister Theresa May proposed beefing up regulations on cyberspace, and weeks later interior minister Amber Rudd travelled to California to ask Silicon Valley to step up efforts against extremism.\nThe Sunday Times quoted Wallace as saying that reliance on the internet made Britain vulnerable to terrorists and rogue states.\n\"That's what keeps me awake at night. We are more vulnerable than at any point in the last 100 years,\" he said.\nTech companies have made life too easy for attackers by refusing to take down extremist material and bomb-making guides, the minister said. Encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp were also a major problem, he said.\n\"I have to have more human surveillance. It's costing hundreds of millions of pounds,\" Wallace said.\n\"Because content is not being taken down as quickly as they could do, we're having to de-radicalise people who have been radicalised. That's costing millions. They can't get away with that and we should look at all the options, including tax.\"\nWallace's quotes did not give further details on tax plans. The Sunday Times reported that any demand would take the form of a windfall tax similar to that imposed on privatised utilities by former Prime Minister Tony Blair's government in 1997.

The cuts are in part a concern, he said, \u201cbecause I think debt levels of the country are unsustainable.\u201d \nKaplan, who does not vote on policy this year as the central bank undergoes an unprecedented leadership overhaul, did not comment specifically on interest rates aside from saying the Fed has \u201cgot some operating room for a while.\u201d He added that cyclical inflation pressures are building with unemployment low. \nThe Fed raised rates three times last year and aims to do the same in 2018, even while tax legislation signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump last month is expected to boost short-term activity. \nThe bill slashes the corporate tax rate and offers cuts for individuals, stimulus that Republicans argue will boost both business and consumer spending. But the individual cuts are skewed toward higher-income households, which economists say have a low propensity to consume, and the overall bill is expected to balloon the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The national debt is roughly $20 trillion. \nThe Fed expects a modest economic boost from the bill that does not, for now, require tighter-than-expected monetary policy, according to a handful of interviews with policymakers in recent days. \n\u201cWe have to be vigilant at the Fed\u201d because there are concerns, Kaplan told the event called the Weitzman Group Annual Retail Forecast. Still, he added, the bill reforms the tax structure in positive ways that should attract investments to the United States and create incentives. \nKaplan said he was \u201cpretty confident that business investments will be better this year\u201d thanks to the tax cuts.

Mandatory Credit: Sergei Belski-USA TODAY Sports\/File Photo \nHowever, the lure of the ice -- and of competition -- proved too strong for the legendary Canadian pair, bringing them out of retirement in the 2016-17 season for a record-setting second stint of their two-decade long partnership. \n\u201cWhen we thought about the 2018 Olympics and not being there, knowing that physically we still probably had a chance, that just didn\u2019t sit well with us,\u201d the 28-year-old Virtue told Reuters. \n\u201cWe\u2019re such competitors and we really would have missed out. Now that we\u2019re back it is just affirmation that we made the right decision. We know we are in the right place.\u201d \nAt Skate Canada this year, they set a new record score with their routines: a catchy Latin-themed short dance to a medley of Rolling Stones, Eagles and Santana songs, and a powerful, emotive free dance to the \u201cMoulin Rouge\u201d score. \nThey were undefeated until the Grand Prix Final in December, when the French team of Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron took the gold, setting the stage for an Olympic showdown next month in Pyeongchang. \nMoir and Virtue were first paired in 1997 by his aunt, their then-coach, and have continued to take nothing for granted ever since, with the 30-year-old even describing himself as \u201cterrified\u201d before their initial comeback event. \n\u201cWe were in training, everything felt normal, and we got to the point of competing, which is supposed to be our strong suit,\u201d he said. \n\u201dWe have all this experience, we\u2019ve done so many shows, and I remember feeling so much electricity running through my body, more than I ever have my whole career. That pressure really got to me and all of a sudden we made a mistake... We didn\u2019t unravel but we were just kind of shocked. \n\u201cIt was spooky, a little, but was a good reminder that just because we had success competing in the past doesn\u2019t mean it is a given that we are going to be good again,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have to work for it.\u201d FILE PHOTO: Figure Skating - ISU World Championships 2017 - Ice Dance Short Dance - Helsinki, Finland - 31\/3\/17 - Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir of Canada compete.

Moir said they grew up together and spent a lot of time in the car, listening to music. \n\u201dWhen it comes to skating we have similar tastes,\u201c Virtue said. \u201dWe are open to one another\u2019s ideas as well. \n\u201cIf I see Scott passionate about a piece of music and if he has a strong desire to skate to it, it\u2019s likely I will feel the same because there\u2019s something tangible about that energy.\u201d \nWhen they topped the podium in 2010, they became the first, and so far only, ice dancers to win gold on their Olympic debut. In Sochi, they came second to Meryl Davis and Charlie White of the United States, who have since retired. \nThe pair thrive on competition. Asked if they felt they had a target on their backs, Moir said: \u201cI hope so. I love it.\u201d \nTheir competitiveness has now been challenged by Papadakis and Cizeron after they lost out to the French pair at the Grand Prix Final. \n\u201cNow it\u2019s kind of looking forward to the Olympics, which will be the next time we get to go head-to-head with them, and we\u2019re pretty motivated,\u201d Moir told a news conference after the competition. \n\u201cWe\u2019re not a team that likes coming in second, much like them, so it\u2019ll be a pretty intense competition.\u201d Writing and additional reporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by John O'Brien"}
{"published":"2018-01-08T17:00:00.000+02:00","title":"GoPro Announces Preliminary Fourth Quarter 2017 Results","text":"SAN MATEO, Calif., Jan. 8, 2018 \/PRNewswire\/ -- GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ: GPRO) today reported certain preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. GoPro expects revenue to be approximately $340 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter revenue includes a negative impact of approximately $80 million for price protection on HERO6 Black, HERO5 Black and HERO5 Session cameras, as well as the Karma drone.\nGoPro expects GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 to be between 24% and 26%. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 is expected to be between 25% and 27%. Non-GAAP gross margin for the same period, excluding the price protection impact of $80 million and other charges of between $19 million and $21 million, is expected to be between 44% and 46%. GoPro expects GAAP operating expenses to be between $136 million and $140 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and non-GAAP operating expenses to be between $118 million and $122 million for the same period.\nGoPro ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $247 million, up $50 million over the third quarter of 2017.\n\"As we noted in our November earnings call, at the start of the holiday quarter we saw soft demand for our HERO5 Black camera,\" said GoPro founder and CEO Nicholas Woodman. \"Despite significant marketing support, we found consumers were reluctant to purchase HERO5 Black at the same price it launched at one year earlier. Our December 10 holiday price reduction provided a sharp increase in sell-through.\"\nGlobally, HERO5 Black sell-through more than doubled in the two weeks following the December 10 price reduction, while HERO5 Session sell-through roughly tripled.\nSales of the newly introduced flagship HERO6 Black camera performed as expected during the fourth quarter. On January 7, GoPro lowered the price of its premium model, HERO6 Black from $499 to $399 to align with its good, better, best product strategy.\nInitial uptake of GoPro's newly launched spherical camera, Fusion, was better than expected during the quarter.\n\"GoPro is committed to turning our business around in 2018,\" said Nicholas Woodman. \"We entered the new year with strong sell-through and are excited with our hardware and software roadmap. We expect that going forward, our roadmap coupled with a lower operating expense model will enable GoPro to return to profitability and growth in the second half of 2018.\"\n2018 Products and Operating Expenses\nIn 2018, GoPro will continue to innovate with several new products aimed at new and existing customers. GoPro's sharper focus will enable an $80 million reduction in operating expenses compared to 2017 levels, resulting in a target operating expense level of below $400 million for 2018 on a non-GAAP basis.\nThe lower non-GAAP operating expense target will be achieved through a variety of strategies, including:\nGoPro is reducing its global workforce from 1,254 employees as of September 30, 2017 to fewer than 1,000 employees worldwide. GoPro founder and CEO Nicholas Woodman will reduce his 2018 cash compensation to $1. Although Karma reached the #2 market position in its price band in 2017, the product faces margin challenges in an extremely competitive aerial market. Furthermore, a hostile regulatory environment in Europe and the United States will likely reduce the total addressable market in the years ahead. These factors make the aerial market untenable and GoPro will exit the market after selling its remaining Karma inventory. GoPro will continue to provide service and support to Karma customers.\nA restructuring of GoPro's business will result in an estimated aggregate charge of $23 million to $33 million, including approximately $13 million to $18 million of cash expenditures as a result of a reduction in force, substantially all of which are severance and related costs, as well as approximately $10 million to $15 million of other charges, consisting primarily of non-cash items. GoPro expects to recognize most of the restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2018. GoPro will provide more detail on its 2017 results and 2018 outlook in its fourth quarter earnings report which will take place in early February.\nAbout GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ: GPRO)\nGoPro makes it easy for people to celebrate and share experiences. We believe life is more meaningful when shared. We build cameras, software and accessories that help the world share itself in immersive and exciting ways.\nGoPro, HERO, Karma, Quik, QuikStories and their respective logos are trademarks or registered trademarks of GoPro, Inc. in the United States and other countries.\nFor more information, visit www.gopro.com or connect with GoPro on Facebook , Instagram , LinkedIn , Pinterest , Twitter , YouTube , and GoPro's The Inside Line .\nNote Regarding Use of Non- GAAP Financial Measures\nGoPro reports gross margin and operating expenses in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP items exclude, where applicable, the effects of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, restructuring costs and aerial-related charges. A reconciliation of preliminary 2017 GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures is presented below. A reconciliation to 2018 target GAAP operating expense has not been provided because doing so would require an unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of information needed to calculate reconciling items and due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures in future periods. When planning, forecasting and analyzing operating expenses for future periods, GoPro does so primarily on a non-GAAP basis without preparing a GAAP analysis as that would require estimates for reconciling items which are inherently difficult to predict with reasonable accuracy.\nNote on Forward-looking Statements\nThis press release may contain projections or other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, but are not limited to, our expectations regarding our revenue, including the impact of price protection charges, gross margin and operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017; our business outlook for 2018 regarding our 2018 operating plan and our return to profitability and growth in the second half of 2018; our 2018 product roadmap, including new hardware and services; anticipated reductions in operating expenses for 2018 as compared to 2017; and aggregate charges for employee termination and the timing to recognize these charges and other costs associated with the restructuring, including the estimates of related cash expenditures by GoPro in connection with the restructuring. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual events or results may differ materially.

The company also will update its iOS operating system so users can see whether the battery is in poor condition and affecting the phone's performance.\nThune asked if Apple considered making free battery replacements available or if it explored offering rebates for customers who paid full price for replacement batteries.\nHe also wants to know if Apple notified consumers of the throttling feature in software updates, which slows the phone, and if customers had the option of declining the update. The letter also asked if similar software was used in earlier iPhone models.\nThune wants Apple's answers by Jan. 23\nAn Apple spokesman did not respond to a request for comment early Wednesday.\nApple addressed the concerns about the quality and durability of its products at a time when it is charging $999 for its newest flagship model, the iPhone X.\n\"We know that some of you feel Apple has let you down,\" it said last month. \"We apologize.\"\nApple acknowledged earlier in December that iPhone software can slow down some phones with battery problems. Apple said the problem was that aging lithium batteries delivered power unevenly, which could cause iPhones to shut down unexpectedly to protect the delicate circuits inside.\nThat disclosure played on a common belief among consumers that Apple purposely slows down older phones to encourage customers to buy newer iPhone models. While no credible evidence has emerged that Apple engaged in such conduct, the battery disclosure struck a nerve on social media and elsewhere.\nLawsuits have been filed in California, New York and Illinois alleging the company defrauded users by slowing down devices without warning.\nThe company also faces a legal complaint in France, where so-called \"planned obsolesce\" is against the law."}

REUTERS\/Leonhard Foeger That cutting edge design does not end with the ski.\nMinute, detailed effort goes into the fit and comfort of boots as well as their \u2018canting\u2019 - the slight inward- or outward-tilting angle of the shoe that is tailored to match the angle of the skier\u2019s knees.\n\u201cWhere we try and get ahead of the game is with some of our top athletes,\u201d Humphreys said.\n\u201cWe do have casts of their feet and their lower legs so we can work on them in terms of pressure points and customisation without the athlete having to be there.\u201d\nDEMANDING ATHLETES\nSlideshow (10 Images) For Atomic, their top athletes are local product Hirscher, who lives close to Altenmarkt, and Shiffrin, who won the slalom gold in Sochi and became the overall World Cup women\u2019s champion this year.\n\u201cI started skiing on Atomic when I was 12 and have skied Atomic skis, boots, and bindings since then,\u201d the American told Reuters.\n\u201cIt was just a natural progression for me to stick with the skis that I had been so confident on as I started racing on the World Cup.\u201d\nAtomic, like the other manufacturers HEAD and Frances\u2019 Rossignol, send their technical experts to accompany the top racers at every event, working closely with their coaches and national federations, to tune and service their gear like a Formula One team to suit the conditions.\n\u201cThey\u2019re athletes, they\u2019re champions, they\u2019re demanding,\u201d Mayrhofer added.\n\u201cTherefore you need a team. For Hirscher, for Shiffrin you have a dedicated team with ski makers, boot specialists, you have all the experts there.\u201d\nWith the event now in sight, Mayrhofer said he felt quietly confident all of their planning would pay off.\n\u201dI have a good feeling we are nicely prepared. I feel good we will have everything we need,\u201c he said. \u201dThen it\u2019s always (necessary) of course to be a bit lucky also.\n\u201cBut we have great athletes, we have all the stuff together which is needed to win.\u201d\nReporting by Leonhard Foeger from Altenmarkt and Mark Trevelyan from London; additional reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n "}

So boring. So tedious. How soon can it be over?\nBut look at the simple twist to each message, and you'll see how a fresh perspective can propel your career in unexpected ways.\nThe first four examples focus on finding a job.\nHow to write someone after a networking event Boring way: \"So nice to meet you. Please keep me in mind for any potential job opportunities.\"\nSmarter way: Do research on the employer's business and weave your findings into the message. You will score major points and build trust at the same time.\nSmarter way example: \n\"After I left, I did more research on your company, Acme Corporation. I especially like the fun recycling program with the hashtag #gogreenportland. That's the kind of creative, digital campaign I want to work on.\"\nHow to apply even if the company has no openings at the time Boring way: \"I'm in the job market and would love to know if your company is hiring.\"\nSmarter way: Like example No. 1, research the company and provide an example of a recent project you respect. The strategy makes your email authentic and genuine -- and you'll stand a far better chance at a response. From there, who knows? The conversation could lead to job. A flat, boring message (because you rushed through it) will take you nowhere.\nSmarter way example: \nI checked out the Acme Corporation website and respect the work you do, in particular the 10K walk to support research on brain cancer and the capital campaign to aid the river clean-up. The two projects were well orchestrated, and it's clear your team knows how to deliver results.\"\nHow to ask for a letter of recommendation Boring way: \"Are you able to write me a letter of recommendation? Please let me know.\"\nSmarter way: Ask the person to share a specific example of your past success. The request will ensure the letter isn't full of empty rhetoric like \"best person I have ever had the pleasure of working with.\"\nSmarter way example: \n\"Would you be able to write a letter of recommendation for me? If so, I think the boss would like to know about the time I ran all over NYC to gather different types of flowers for the outdoor garden photo shoot. That day is a great example of my hustle and focus.\"\nHow to ask for an informational interview Boring way: \"Are you able to meet with me for an informational interview?\"\nSmarter way: Study up on the employer's own background and provide an example of how you respect the person's career path so far. Be selfless and the person will be inclined to respond.\nSmarter way example: \n\"I read about your background and see you began as an intern at Big Corporation and rose to become a senior vice president. It's inspiring for someone like me who has started out in the field.\"\nHow to send effective LinkedIn invites (not an email but the same principles apply) Boring way (the default line from LinkedIn): \"Hi Danny, I'd like to join your LinkedIn network.\"\nSmarter way: Make the message customized! Why would someone respond to the generic line from LinkedIn? Take time to craft a unique message to encourage the person to write back.\nSmarter way example: \nIf you saw\/read\/heard the person and liked what he\/she is all about, go with something like, \"I enjoyed your interview about children and nutrition on the radio. How did you become an expert in the space?\"\nThe final four emails relate at a job.\nHow to relay that you're troubleshooting a problem Boring way: \"We're working on it. Will keep you posted.\"\nSmarter way: Be as specific as possible. The client is likely stressed, and details will help to put him\/her at ease.\nSmarter way example: \n\"I want to let you know we are aware of the mistake with the shipment of hard drives to California. Our team is working on the problem now and will continue to provide updates as they come available.\"\nHow to ask if a company wants to be a sponsor Boring way: \"We would love to have your company as a sponsor.\"\nSmarter way: Before you write the person at the company, review the company's website and choose one recent accomplishment to include at the start of your email. Don't \"sell\" right out of the gate; be authentic and build a relationship!\nSmarter way example (imagine the company works in construction): \n\"Congrats on the completion of the multi-purpose center at Acme University. What a beautiful building!\"\nHow to ask if you can guest post on a blog or website Boring way: \"Do you accept guest posts? I'd love to contribute!\"\nSmarter way: Visit the website where you want to guest post, read at least one blog post and then return to your email and explain to the site editor specifically how much you value what you read. DO NOT tell the person, \"You have amazing content\" but never back up the claim. Fake praise all the way.\nSmarter way example: \n\"I am a big fan of ABC Money Tips and read your content all the time. I especially like your articles on how to plan for retirement while a college student and 9 ways to save while working multiple part-time jobs. I have several part-time jobs right now and I will put tip No. 3 from your nine-point list to work right away \u2014 the one about how to invest $50 a month in mutual funds through a direct bank deposit. Good idea!\"\nHow to inquire about freelance opportunities Boring way: \"Please know I am available for any freelance opportunities.\"\nSmarter way: Advice from email example No. 1 all over again. Do research on the employer's business and weave your findings into the message. You will score major points and build trust at the same time.\nSmarter way example: \n\"I'd like to explore ways I can help your team on website projects. I checked out Acme Corporation's website and like the work you do, in particular the landing page for the Acme Hospital System and the ecommerce site for the rental car startup. You produce high quality work, and I respect your attention to detail.\"\nLet the competition write typical emails the typical way.\nPush harder. Be different.

A Saudi Aramco employee sits in the area of its stand at the Middle East Petrotech 2016, an exhibition and conference for the refining and petrochemical industries, in Manama, Bahrain, September 27, 2016. REUTERS\/Hamad I Mohammed \nThe meetings are an indication that preparations for a 2018 initial public offering, which could be the biggest IPO in history, are progressing despite market speculation it could be delayed or even shelved. \nExecutives from Citi ( C.N ), Goldman ( GS.N ) and Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), which are all bidding to be global coordinators for the share sale, are among the teams invited to present their pitches in person, said the three sources, including two bankers who expect to attend the meetings. \nThe talks will be held at the end of January or beginning of February in the Eastern Province city of Dhahran, where the state oil company is headquartered, they added. \nTwo of the sources said the talks would involve members of the banks\u2019 equity capital markets teams, executives who would be directly involved in an IPO, rather than top management. \nSaudi Aramco, Deutsche Bank, Citi and Goldman Sachs all declined to comment. \nThe stock market listing of the national champion is a central part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s reform drive aimed at restructuring the kingdom\u2019s economy and reducing its dependence on oil revenue. \nThe government, which aims to float up to 5 percent of the company this year, says Aramco is worth $2 trillion - but several industry experts have questioned whether a valuation that high is realistic. \nAramco had asked the banks to present written pitches last month, according to the sources. The oil giant told bankers not to come up with a valuation, saying it had not provided enough financial information to do so, two of the sources said. \nPreparations for the IPO might be gathering speed just as the price of oil has approached $70 per barrel, the highest since mid-2015, giving Aramco a better chance to achieve its desired valuation and become the world\u2019s most expensive company. CROWN PRINCE \nThe listing IPO-ARMO.SE is a mammoth undertaking, and any banks chosen to be global coordinators will join JPMorgan ( JPM.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and HSBC ( HSBA.L ), who were appointed last year. \nWith so many banks expected to share the fee pool, the advisory mandates are not viewed in the industry as particularly lucrative. But bankers see such roles as a gateway to a host of other deals they expect to flow from the kingdom\u2019s plan to revamp its economy. \nIn another sign that plans for the IPO are moving ahead, Saudi Arabia has changed the status of Aramco to a joint-stock company as of Jan. 1, according to a cabinet decree published in the kingdom\u2019s official bulletin last week. The change of status is a requirement for Saudi companies before they can list, a senior Aramco source told Reuters. \nHowever the final decision about if and when the listing takes place rests with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, according to several banking sources. \nThe prince led an anti-corruption purge which saw several Saudi royals, ministers and businessmen detained late last year. It was the latest in a series of steps he had taken to assert Saudi influence internationally and amass more power for himself at home. \nAs well as the economic reforms, the daunting list of challenges undertaken by the 32-year-old since his father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015 include going to war in Yemen and cranking up Riyadh\u2019s confrontation with arch-foe Iran. \n(Graphic for Aramco's stock exchange suitors, click tmsnrt.rs\/2xSgSST ) Additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Pravin Char"}

He has also held senior financial roles at British food groups Cadbury and Birds Eye Iglo. \nCompass Chairman Paul Walsh said in a statement: \u201cThe thoughts of everyone at Compass are with Richard\u2019s family and friends, and we extend our deepest sympathies to them.\u201d \n\u201cRichard was known and respected for his great humanity and a no-nonsense style that transformed Compass into one of Britain\u2019s leading companies,\u201d he added. \nCousins led Compass over the past 11 years. He was widely credited with turning the company\u2019s business around and making Compass into one of the FTSE 100\u2019s best-performing firms, and had also been named as one of the world\u2019s best-performing CEOs by Harvard Business Review. \nHe joined Tesco ( TSCO.L ) as an independent director in 2014 at the height of the British supermarket chain\u2019s accounting scandal, stepping down from that role at the start of 2017. \nThe family are believed to have been flying back to Sydney from an exclusive waterfront restaurant in Jerusalem Bay when the plane crashed, the BBC reported. \nPolice are working with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to recover the wreckage of the plane, which is submerged in 13 meters of water near Cowan, north of Sydney. A probe into the cause of the crash has begun, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days. Authorities have warned it may take up to a year to find out what happened. \nThe seaplane was part of the Sydney Seaplanes business that offers sight-seeing trips and has operated since 2005 with no previous record of mishap. Seaplane flights have been canceled until further notice. \nCousins\u2019 son William worked at Open Britain, a group campaigning to keep Britain in the European Union single market, and directors and co-workers praised him as an enthusiastic and talented team member.

The new iPhone X is pictured at the Apple Store Marche Saint-Germain in Paris, France, November 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Benoit Tessier\/Files \nBrowser makers Google, Microsoft Corp and Mozilla Corp\u2019s Firefox all confirmed to Reuters that the patches they currently have in place do not protect iOS users. With Safari and virtually all other popular browsers not patched, hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users may have no secure means of browsing the web until Apple issues its patch. \nApple stressed that there were no known instances of hackers taking advantage of the flaw to date. \nOn Wednesday, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and other security researchers disclosed two major chip flaws, one called Meltdown affecting only Intel Corp chips and one called Spectre affecting nearly all computer chips made in the last decade. The news sparked a sell-off in Intel\u2019s stock as investors tried to gauge the costs to the chipmaker. \nIn a statement on its website, Apple said all Mac and iOS devices were affected by both Meltdown and Spectre. But the most recent operating system updates for Mac computers, Apple TVs, iPhones and iPads protect users against the Meltdown attack and do not slow down the devices, it added, and Meltdown does not affect the Apple Watch. \nMacs and iOS devices are vulnerable to Spectre attacks through code that can run in web browsers. Apple said it would issue a patch to its Safari web browser for those devices \u201cin the coming days.\u201d \nShortly after the researchers disclosed the chip flaws on Wednesday, Google and Microsoft released statements telling users which of their products were affected. Google said its users of Android phones - more than 80 percent of the global market - were protected if they had the latest security updates. Apple remained silent for more than a day about the fate of the hundreds of millions of users of its iPhones and iPads. Ben Johnson, co-founder and chief strategist for cyber security firm Carbon Black, said the delay in updating customers about whether Apple\u2019s devices are at risk could affect Apple\u2019s drive to get more business customers to adopt its hardware. \n\u201cSomething this severe gets the attention of all the employees and executives at a company, and when they go asking the IT and security people about it and security doesn\u2019t have an answer for iPhones and iPads, it just doesn\u2019t give a whole lot of confidence,\u201d Johnson said.

Employees of John Deere Europe and members of German industrial metal workers union IG Metall (IGM) protest at the John Deere factory in Mannheim, Germany, January 9, 2018. REUTERS\/Ralph Orlowski \nWith the economy in robust health and unemployment at record lows, the country\u2019s biggest union is demanding an inflation-busting 6 percent pay hike this year for about 3.9 million workers. \nIt is also making a push for shorter hours, more than two decades after it won the 35-hour work week for Germans. \nAhead of a round of regional negotiations due to begin on Thursday, employers have so far offered 2 percent plus a one-off 200 euro (176.37 pounds) payment in the first quarter and rejected demands for shorter hours. \nIn the state of North Rhine-Westphalia alone, the industrial heartland of Germany, workers at 140 companies including Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) and Thyssenkrupp ( TKAG.DE ) staged walkouts and marched outside factory gates carrying banners. \nIn Bavaria to the south, companies including automotive suppliers Schaeffler ( SHA_p.DE ) and ZF [ZFF.UL] were affected. \nThat adds to more than 15,000 workers that had already taken action across the nation by Monday, and IG Metall has announced further walkouts for Wednesday. \nSuch industrial action is common in Germany before sector-wide pay negotiations, and similar walkouts took place in 2016 and 2015. Slideshow (6 Images) \nThe union has made it clear it is drawing a line in the sand regarding shorter working hours and has threatened to move beyond walkouts lasting only a few hours to all-out strikes across the sector. \nThe union has called for higher wages as well as a right to reduce weekly hours to 28 from 35 and return to full-time employment after two years for shift workers and those who need to care for children or elderly relatives. \nEmployers have so far rejected the demand because it includes a provision under which companies would help make up for the pay shortfall for some workers who shorten their hours. \nTalks between unions and employers\u2019 associations are set for Thursday in the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, where Volkswagen\u2019s ( VOWG_p.DE ) Porsche, Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) and automotive suppliers including Bosch [ROBG.UL] are based. \n\u201cIf we do not see any willingness to even discuss the topic seriously on Thursday, the situation will escalate further,\u201d Roman Zitzelsberger, head of IG Metall in Baden-Wuerttemberg, told German daily Handelsblatt. \nNext door in Bavaria, home to companies such as engineering group Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) and carmaker BMW ( BMWG.DE ), negotiations will resume on Jan. 15, and to the north in North Rhine-Westphalia on Jan. 18. \nThe labour dispute follows a strong year of growth in Europe\u2019s largest economy, driven by domestic demand from record numbers of German workers while borrowing costs and inflation remain low and exporters benefit from a global recovery. \nThat pattern should extend through 2018, with the Ifo economic institute last month forecasting growth of 2.6 percent for the year.

Corn inched down for the first time in three sessions, though prices remained near a two-week high hit the previous day. The Chicago Board of Trade most-active wheat contract rose 0.2 percent to $4.22-1\/4 a bushel by 0245 GMT, after closing up 1.2 percent on Wednesday. Corn slid 0.1 percent to $3.52-1\/2 a bushel following a 1.4 percent gain in the previous session when prices touched their highest since Jan. 4 at $3.53-1\/4 a bushel. Soybeans were little changed at $9.68-1\/4 a bushel, having firmed 0.1 percent on Wednesday. Commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT corn, wheat, soybean and soymeal futures contracts on Wednesday and net sellers of soyoil futures, traders said. Trader estimates of net fund buying in corn were in a wide range from 12,000 to 25,000 contracts. Under pressure from abundant global supplies, Chicago wheat dipped to its lowest since Dec. 13 on Tuesday, lifting hopes that buyers would find U.S. wheat competitive. \"Buyers might finally have emerged given the U.S. wheat, via lower prices and a lower greenback, will have cheapened considerably over the past week,\" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. A weaker dollar, which makes U.S. commodities cheaper for importers holding other currencies, added to the bullish sentiment. The U.S. dollar has dropped to its lowest in three years against a basket of currencies. Corn had been under sustained pressure after the U.S. Department of Agriculture crop report last week showed massive stocks and a bigger-than-expected U.S. harvest. But failure to extend those losses since then prompted speculation that a near-term low had been achieved. A drought in the heart of Argentina's Pampas grains belt is expected to reduce corn yields and cut up to 3.7 million tonnes from the projected 2017\/18 harvest, local analysts said on Wednesday. For soybeans, Brazil's Mato Grosso soybean producers have sold less of their new-crop beans so far than they did last year, when sales were already late compared with long-term averages, as they hoard grains in the hope of better prices ahead. \nGrains prices at 0245 GMT \nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 422.25 0.75 +0.18% +0.42% 425.08 45 CBOT corn 352.50 -0.50 -0.14% +1.81% 350.39 59 CBOT soy 969.25 0.50 +0.05% +0.91% 975.88 61 CBOT rice 12.21 $0.05 +0.45% +3.34% $12.06 73 WTI crude 64.22 $0.25 +0.39% +0.77% $59.89 79 \nCurrencies \nEuro\/dlr $1.220 -$0.006 -0.52% -0.54% USD\/AUD 0.7965 0.000 +0.06% +0.03% \nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents\/bushel.

Sandy Huffaker Corbis via Getty Images By Allan Hugh Cole Jr. 2:16 PM EST \nThe pharmaceutical company Pfizer (PFE) , perhaps best known for its erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, recently announced that it will shut down its research and development efforts related to neurological disorders, particularly Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. \nThe company says that this decision will result in the loss of approximately 300 research jobs, but it also suggests that savings will be applied to other Pfizer pursuits. Perhaps this will include research and development of drugs for other diseases, albeit with fewer researchers, but to date, neither the amount the company will save nor its specific use of these freed-up resources has been detailed. \nAs a 49 year old living with Parkinson\u2019s disease, I think Pfizer\u2019s decision is a disappointment. Like more than 10 million others worldwide, I depend on treatment advances to maximize my quality of life, and historically, large pharmaceutical companies have played a key role in spurring these advances. Any one of us can get these life-changing diseases. At the very least, Pfizer should think about the human element in its decisions. \nOn one hand, Pfizer\u2019s decision makes some sense. Finding better treatments, not to mention cures, for brain diseases has proved difficult, particularly for Pfizer. Neurological research requires large investments of time and money, talent, patience, and resolve, before any potential success, and thus profit, can be found. In other words, this kind of research comes with a lot of risk, and Pfizer, it seems, perhaps because of its track record, has become more risk-averse when it comes to neurological diseases. \nOn the other hand, the potential for profit is extraordinary if and when new treatment breakthroughs occur. With respect to Parkinson\u2019s disease, many researchers and neurologists routinely recognize that we are quite close to having several potentially \u201cgame-changing\u201d treatments available, meaning within the next five years. Consider the 10 million people living with Parkinson\u2019s disease and the more than 44 million people living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and factor in that the frequency of both is expected to increase considerably as people live longer. Some predict a threefold increase in Alzheimer\u2019s cases alone. Moreover, consider that, in 2017, Alzheimer\u2019s cost the United States more than $259 billion, and that estimates suggest the cost will rise to more than $1 trillion by 2050 . \nI don\u2019t know how much is spent annually on treating erectile dysfunction, but clearly, finding treatments and cures for neurological disorders has a profound positive impact on the larger economic and public good. \nAll is not lost. Many pharmaceutical companies continue to work on treatments for neurological diseases, as do many smaller biotech firms and academic medical research centers, and funding sources for these pursuits include private foundations as well as governments. The role that big pharma plays in research, while valuable, is often tenuous, because profit models for many diseases are not always apparent, at least in the short term. \n\nThat\u2019s one reason I support the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research. Its mission is to help minimize the research and development risk that gave Pfizer cold feet. In other words, they make it less risky for companies to invest in research and development by underwriting the costs. The breakthroughs will come. We are close. Maximizing support for the efforts of those such as Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research and academic medical research centers is key, especially now because other major pharmaceutical companies could follow Pfizer\u2019s decision. \nQuestions about Pfizer\u2019s decision remain, a principal one being whether curbing costs related to developing new neurological drugs will result in the price of other Pfizer drugs decreasing. I hope so, particularly in light of pharmaceutical companies frequently pointing to the high costs of developing new drugs as being the primary reason prices are so high for existing drugs. \nAllan Hugh Cole Jr. is a professor and senior associate dean in the Steve Hicks School of Social Work at The University of Texas at Austin.

My first attempt at homemade brunch may not have been as \"Insta-worthy\" as $16 avocado toast, but everyone was well-fed and happy, and my friends didn't spend a penny. \nHere's what I learned after turning $30, plus pantry items, into a three-course boozy brunch for six: \n1. Get creative with what you already have. Plan your meal around what's already in your kitchen. As I learned, even if you don't have much in your pantry, a little bit of creativity can go a long way. \n2. Make a grocery list and stick to it. Once you've planned out what you're going to cook, make a list of the ingredients you'll need. Then, when you're actually shopping, stick to the list. No impulse buys! \nIf you're trying to stick to a specific grocery budget, try going cash only. Determine how much you want to spend on food for the week or for that specific grocery trip and withdraw that amount of cash. When you head to the store, leave your plastic at home so you're not tempted to use it. \n3. Homemade yogurt, if done correctly, is a great money-saving hack. Yogurt is expandable, so you can turn just a half cup into a large batch. There are a bunch of step-by-step recipes online , but the gist of it is: Heat the milk to right below boiling, add yogurt with active bacteria to the heated milk and let it set for about four hours in a warm area. \nI took a wrong turn somewhere along the way, but it you do it correctly, you can take $5 worth of ingredients and make way more for less. \n4. Keep it simple. When you're hosting a bunch of people, simplicity wins. Complex meals with a lot of spices or sauces can get pricey, not to mention time consuming and stressful. \nWhile the yogurt may have been overly ambitious for me, in general, my menu was simple and didn't call for too many ingredients. And since I didn't need to dish out too much on my main course, I could afford to splurge on colorful fruit garnishes and fancier deli chorizo. \nChilaquiles is just one of many simple and tasty options. If you find yourself hosting brunch, try something like french toast, pancakes or an egg casserole. \n5. Cooking may take more effort than dining out, but the savings are huge. Prepping food for six in a tiny New York City apartment was not easy. It took a lot more planning than I anticipated and five stressful and sweaty hours in the kitchen. \nBut the savings are completely worth it. The typical boozy brunch in New York is going to set you back at least $30. I managed to feed six for the same amount of money. Say you skipped four $30 boozy brunches per month and replaced them with $5 homemade meals. That's a savings of $100 a month, or $1,200 a year \u2026 just on brunch."}

Ryanair Boeing 737-800 aircraft taxi at Manchester Airport, Britain, January 8, 2018. REUTERS\/Phil Noble \nThe mishandling of staff holidays caused thousands of flight cancellations, angered passengers and helped pilots to secure union recognition for the first time in Ryanair\u2019s 32-year history, sending the share price down 9 percent in one day in December. \nThe holiday rota errors were a rare serious slip-up by Chief Executive Michael O\u2018Leary, whose formula of dirt cheap, no-frills travel has transformed the continent\u2019s airline sector and handed his shareholders big returns. \nO\u2018Leary had said hell would freeze over before he would welcome unions into Ryanair.

HSBC declined to comment on the decision. \nBut other big Ryanair shareholders are maintaining or adding to their holdings. \n\u201cBecause the share price has fallen, it has become, in our opinion, compellingly attractive,\u201d said Rory Powe, who manages European growth stocks at Man GLG and added to his Ryanair holdings in December. \u201cI don\u2019t see Ryanair\u2019s cost advantage being eroded by anything more than an immaterial amount.\u201d \nRyanair\u2019s longer-term record as an investment may help explain why top shareholders appear reluctant to drop it. \nThe shares are up 150 percent over four years as it tackled a reputation for shoddy services and wooed higher-paying business passengers. Shares in its most successful rival, Easyjet ( EZJ.L ), have barely moved in that time. \nAnalysts agree upcoming union negotiations will be crucial, amid questions over whether O\u2018Leary\u2019s pugnacious management style is still appropriate for a company that was once an upstart challenger but now dominates European short-haul air travel. \n\u201cA unionised Ryanair will still be profitable, cash generative and value-creating in our view but will be a markedly different company,\u201d HSBC analysts said last week, rating the shares \u201creduce\u201d. \nHSBC believes Ryanair unit costs could rise by 20 percent by 2020, with unionisation and the localisation of contracts, and that Ryanair\u2019s talks with continental unions could be tough, \u201c...and airline strikes in these markets are commonplace\u201d. \nBernstein sees a short-term rebound in the stock but believes Ryanair is \u201ccornered\u201d - profitability per passenger will fall if it continues to expand at the current pace but a slowdown in expansion will cause earnings to decline. \n\u201cCATEGORY KILLER\u201d \nOther big Ryanair institutional investors acknowledge the challenges but believe that, with its cost base still below rivals, it can still make bumper profits as the euro zone economy picks up steam, industry capacity growth eases and prices recover. \nRyanair has said it does not expect its costs to increase significantly. \nJonathan Fearon, who runs the Aberdeen Standard European Growth fund, said the market seemed to be pricing in the idea that Ryanair\u2019s cost advantage will disappear. \nBut he said staff costs were only one of many advantages in Ryanair\u2019s broad \u201cultra-low-cost\u201d business model. \nFearon indicated Ryanair was still a favourite: it was a \u201ccategory killer\u201d in short-haul that stood to gain from Alitalia\u2019s troubles and as industry capacity growth slows, boosting fares. \nTony Gibb, investment director at another Ryanair shareholder, Fidelity, said the company\u2019s significant cost advantage, even over EasyJet, was \u201csustainable\u201d and last month\u2019s share slump was \u201cprobably overplayed\u201d. \n\u201cThere is negative press and the share price has come off quite meaningfully but that is probably more of an opportunity than anything else,\u201d said Gibb. \n(Graphic for Ryanair's share price relative to future earnings has ebbed, click reut.rs\/2CIUkCO ) Additional reporting by Conor Humphries and Victoria Bryan Graphics by Ritvik Carvalho; Editing by Susan Fenton"}

(NYSE: NYRT) (the \"Company\" or \"NYRT\"), which is liquidating and winding down pursuant to a plan of liquidation, announced today the Company's Board of Directors has declared a cash liquidating distribution of $2.00 per share to be paid on January 26, 2018 to shareholders of record as of January 19, 2018. The liquidating distribution is being paid from the net proceeds from recent property sales.\nInvestors should note that the ex-dividend date is set by the NYSE. Under the rules of the NYSE, when a distribution is declared in a per share amount that exceeds 25% of a company's stock price, the date on which that company's shares will begin to trade without the dividend, or ex-dividend, is the first business day following the payment date. Accordingly, the NYSE has informed the Company that it will set an ex-dividend date for the cash liquidating distribution of January 29, 2018. On the record date of January 19, 2018, the NYSE will attach a due bill to the shares of NYRT which represents the right to receive the distribution payable on January 26, 2018. Consequently, if a shareholder as of the record date sells shares at any time prior to the ex-dividend date of January 29, 2018, they will also be selling the due bill and will not receive the cash liquidating distribution. Conversely, anyone buying the shares between the record date and the ex-dividend date will also be acquiring the due bill and will be entitled to receive the distribution payable on January 26, 2018.\nSeparately, the Company has announced that it has closed on the previously announced sale of its property located at 333 West 34 th Street in New York, New York for $255.0 million to real estate funds managed by Brookfield Asset Management. The 333 West 34th Street property was part of the collateral for the Company's cross collateralized and secured loan. In connection with the sale, the Company paid approximately $110.6 million on account of the loan as required by the loan documents, resulting in a remaining outstanding principal balance on the loan of approximately $65.6 million. After satisfaction of debt, pro-rations and closing costs, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $134.6 million. The selling price is consistent with the Company's last reported net assets in liquidation as of September 30, 2017.\nAbout NYRT\nNYRT is a publicly traded real estate investment trust listed on the NYSE that owns income-producing commercial real estate, including office and retail properties, located in New York City. NYRT's shareholders recently adopted a plan of liquidation pursuant to which NYRT is liquidating and winding down and, in connection therewith, is seeking to sell its assets in an orderly fashion to maximize shareholder value.

Trump\u2019s Dec. 6 decision sparked regional protests and prompted the Palestinians to rule out Washington as a peace broker in any future talks. \nNabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, described Trump\u2019s policy shift on Jerusalem and the passage of the amendment as \u201ca declaration of war against the Palestinian people\u201d. \n\u201cThe vote clearly shows that the Israeli side has officially declared an end to the so-called political process,\u201d Abu Rdainah said, referring to U.S.-sponsored talks on Palestinian statehood that collapsed in 2014. \nIsrael captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. It says the entire city is its \u201ceternal and indivisible\u201d capital. \nPalestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the capital of a state they seek to establish in the occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. FILE PHOTO: An Israeli flag is seen near the Dome of the Rock, located in Jerusalem's Old City on the compound known to Muslims as Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as Temple Mount December 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Ammar Awad\/File Photo \nThe amendment, long in the legislative pipeline, was passed with 64 lawmakers voting in favor and 52 against. \nOpposition head Isaac Herzog said Jewish Home was leading Israel \u201ctoward a terrible disaster\u201d. Jewish Home\u2019s leader, Naftali Bennett, said the vote showed that Israel would keep control of all of Jerusalem forever. \n\u201cThere will be no more political skulduggery that will allow our capital to be torn apart,\u201d Bennett said on Twitter. Slideshow (2 Images) \nA bid to revive Israeli-Palestinian negotiations led by the president\u2019s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has so far shown no progress. \nOn Sunday, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party unanimously urged legislators in a non-binding resolution to effectively annex Israeli settlements built in the West Bank. [L8N1OV0GP] \nPolitical commentators said Likud\u2019s decision might bolster right-wing support for Netanyahu, who could seek a public mandate in an early election while he awaits possible criminal indictments against him on corruption suspicions. He denies wrongdoing. \nParliamentary elections are not due until November 2019 but the police investigations in two cases of alleged corruption against Netanyahu and tensions among coalition partners in his government could hasten a poll. \nSome commentators, pointing to an existing law that already sets a similar high threshold for handing over territory in a land-for-peace deal, have said Jewish Home was essentially competing with Likud for support among the right-wing base. \n(This version of the story refiles to remove extraneous word in paragraph 14.)

Pressure on Sessions has been rising, and some conservative Republican lawmakers have called on him to resign.\nThe White House said Pruitt will attend a weekend meeting at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with Trump, other Cabinet members and Republican congressional leaders to lay out legislative priorities for the year and discuss a strategy for the November congressional elections.\nSessions will not attend, his office said.\nPruitt served as Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general prior to taking the EPA job, suing the EPA 14 times, each time taking the side of industry.

Lovelace, sold for $26,000. The countess was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron.\nThe third item, a signed letter from legendary naturalist Charles Darwin to a man named Thomas Green about the publication of Darwin's research during his travels aboard the HMS Beagle, went at auction for $5,500, Gazzale said.\nAll told, tax officials recouped $134,500 from selling off the Shkreli items that they seized.\nThe Enigma machine's seizure came seven months before federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, listed it as an asset they wanted him to forfeit in connection with his criminal conviction. The seizure came four months before Shrekli was convicted in the fraud case.\nShkreli's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, first disclosed the Enigma machine's seizure on Thursday in a letter filed in Brooklyn federal court that opposes a forfeiture request by prosecutors.\nBrafman's letter did not contain either the date of the filing or the amount obtained for the machine at auction. Nor did the lawyer's letter mention the historical documents seized by tax officials.\nBrafman, who could not be reached for comment, wrote in his filing that despite the state's auction of the Enigma machine, the 34-year-old Shkreli still owed New York state more than $450,000 in taxes.\nLandon Dowdy | CNBC The German \u201cEnigma\u201d coding machine used during World War II. In a filing in December, federal prosecutors in a filing said they were seeking forfeiture of Shkreli's Enigma machine, as well as of a Picasso painting, a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album and more than $7 million in funds .\nBrafman's letter laid out his objections to the forfeiture, saying prosecutors had failed to establish \"that there are any forefeitable proceeds traceable to Mr. Shkreli's crimes of conviction.\" Those crimes include duping a group of investors in two hedge funds he ran.\nBrafman argues Shkreli \"was not indicted because he stole anyone's money.\"\nBrafman told CNBC last month: \"Our position is clear. ... None of the investors lost any money and Martin did not personally benefit from any of the counts of conviction. Accordingly, forfeiture of any assets is not an appropriate remedy.\"\nA spokesman for Brooklyn federal prosecutors declined to comment when asked about Brafman's letter, and referred questions about the auction to state tax officials.\nBrafman, in his filing, said that in the event Judge Kiyo Matsumoto orders forfeiture in the case, prosecutors \"should not be permitted to substitute assets.\" Brafman then noted the seizure and auction of the Enigma machine by state tax officials.\nThe Enigma machine's code during the war was cracked by a British team lead by Alan Turing, whose last name was used by Shkreli to name one of his companies, Turing Pharmaceuticals. Federal prosecutors are also seeking Shkreli's shares in Turing as part of their forefeiture demand.\nShkreli first gained widespread public notoriety in 2015, when Turing hiked the price of an anti-parasitic drug by more than 5,000 percent . Turing's name since has been changed to Vyera Pharmaceuticals .\nIn a Vanity Fair magazine profile published that same year , Shkreli said he was \"conflicted\" about having purchased an Enigma machine \"because it's a Nazi relic.\"\n\"It's like owning a gas chamber \u2014 like, what the f---?\u2014 but it's a constant reminder that we should use knowledge for good, even if the process is ugly,\" Shkreli told the magazine. \"From the Pythagorean theorem to Fermat's theorem, the math is ugly, but if you hold your nose during the process of proving it, you get to the right place.\"\nShkreli was convicted in August of defrauding a group of investors in two hedge funds he ran by misrepresenting the performance of ther investments . He also was accused, but acquitted of, swindling money from another drug company he founded, Retrophin , to repay those investors.\nShkreli, who is due to be sentenced in the case next month, currently is locked up without bail in a Brooklyn federal jail.\nHis $5 million bail was revoked in September by Matsumoto, who was outraged over his offer on Facebook of a $5,000 bounty for people who grabbed locks of hair off the head of Hillary Clinton."}

Dallas-based MoneyGram specializes in cross-border transfers of funds, and Ant Financial\u2019s takeover bid highlights the significance of moving payments across borders\u2014an action as important to international e-commerce as the ability to move goods from country to country.

A handful of Canadian miners are looking at producing more of the crucial component in lithium-ion batteries, the WSJ\u2019s David George-Cosh reports, betting they can build a bigger supply chain with a socially responsible source of the metal . That question over sourcing is a cloud over the auto-industry efforts to bulk up mass production of electric vehicles, which are powered by the batteries. Most cobalt currently comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where supply is threatened by political, legal and labor issues, leaving suppliers looking elsewhere for the mineral. Canada is the world\u2019s third-biggest producer of cobalt, after the Congo and China, accounting for about 6% of the world\u2019s supply, and new exploration by miners including Vale SA, Sherritt International Corp. and others could increase that share. The efforts have demand and basic economics on their side: the price of cobalt more than doubled over the past year.\nTRANSPORTATION Port Newark in Elizabeth, N.J.

The research will enable operators of thousands of existing horizontal wells that have undergone fracking to determine which of them can be fracked again, the DOE said. It will receive $8 million.\nThe field lab at Virginia Polytech Institute and State University will receive nearly $8 million for investigating the potential for reservoirs in the Nora Gas Field.\nAmong the other projects is C-Crete Technologies LLC in Stafford, Texas which will receive $1.5 million to develop well cement to prevent offshore oil spills and leaks under high temperatures, high pressure and corrosive conditions.\nReporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Frances Kerry\n "}

And what's the best way to withdraw your savings over the years?\nSteve Vernon , consulting research scholar at the Stanford Center on Longevity , set out to answer these questions by collaborating with the Society of Actuaries (SOA) on a research project: \" How to 'Pensionize' Any IRA or 401(k) Plan .\" \"What we wanted to do was identify a strategy that middle-income workers could use that's fairly straightforward and that they could do on their own,\" Vernon tells CNBC Make It .\nAfter analyzing 292 different retirement income strategies, the research team identified the best way for most people to withdraw their money in retirement. They call it the \"spend safely in retirement\" strategy.\n\"This is a strategy that people can use to decide if they've got enough money to retire,\" says Vernon. \"But also, a lot of people are uncertain as to when they'll retire and if they should work part-time for a while, so this strategy can help them think through those questions.\"\nshow chapters The definitive guide to retirement savings plans      10:50 AM ET Wed, 9 Aug 2017 | 01:51 The winning strategy produces \"more average total retirement income expected throughout retirement compared to most solutions we analyzed,\" Vernon reports, and \"provides a lifetime income, no matter how long the participant lives.\"\nHere are two key components of the \"spend safely in retirement\" strategy:\n1. Delay Social Security payments until age 70. \"For middle income people, Social Security is going to be the majority of their income [in retirement],\" says Vernon. \"It will be anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of their total income. \n\"And Social Security is nearly a perfect retirement income generator: It lasts the rest of your life, it protects against inflation, it doesn't go down if the stock market crashes, it's paid automatically into your checking account, part of it isn't subject to income taxes. No other retirement income generator has all of those positive features, so maximizing Social Security is a key part of this strategy.\"\nThe best way to do so is to delay receiving Social Security benefits until age 70, he says.\nshow chapters Here are signs that you are on track for early retirement      2:03 PM ET Wed, 19 April 2017 | 01:30 If you want to retire before then, one option is to work part-time and make just enough to cover living expenses until age 70, notes Vernon.\nIf working until 70 is out of the question for you, the next best thing to do is to use a portion of your retirement savings to substitute the Social Security benefits you're delaying, Vernon says: \"Suppose Social Security at age 65 would have been $20,000 per year and you're delaying it for five years. That's $100,000. So you set aside $100,000 and that's what you withdraw from age 65 to 70.\"\nYou may also have to reduce living expenses during the delay period.\n\"Maximizing Social Security is a key part of this strategy.\" -Steve Vernon, consulting research scholar at the Stanford Center on Longevity \"Pessimists might point out that Social Security is subject to political risk; our leaders can change the amount of benefits paid to current retirees or older workers,\" the report notes, adding, \"when deciding on a Social Security claiming strategy, older workers must weigh this risk against Social Security's other desirable features.\"\n2. Create an \"automatic retirement paycheck.\" To supplement Social Security income, the strategy recommends investing any remaining savings in low-cost mutual funds that are common in IRAs and 401(k) plans, like target date, balanced or stock index funds. \nWhen it comes to withdrawing your savings, you'll want to generate consistent \"paychecks\" from your 401(k) and IRA savings that will last the rest of your life. Use the IRS required minimum distribution (RMD) to calculate how much of your retirement savings you would receive each year. (The IRS requires you to make minimum withdrawals from your retirement savings at age 70-1\/2 to be included in your taxable income.)\nshow chapters Here\u2019s what you need to know about your 401(k) when you get a new job      12:03 PM ET Thu, 6 April 2017 | 01:01 The great thing about this strategy is that many IRA and 401(k) administrators can calculate your RMD and pay it automatically in the frequency you want, so you will essentially be creating an automatic retirement paycheck.\n\"The purpose of the RMD is for the federal government to capture taxable income from retirement accounts. It wasn't devised as a spend-down strategy,\" says Vernon, although \"several analysts have studied the RMD as a drawdown strategy, and they have concluded it's a viable way to produce a stream of lifetime retirement income.\"\nAll in all, the \"spend safely in retirement\" strategy, which can be refined and modified however you like, can \"help virtually anybody generate a stream of income in retirement,\" says Vernon, who plans to use a version of the strategy himself.\nSee the full report from the Stanford Center on Longevity here .\nLike this story?

In April, Trump told Reuters he would either renegotiate or terminate what he called a \u201chorrible\u201d trade deal that has doubled the U.S. goods trade deficit with South Korea since 2012. \nOn Monday, Kim told reporters that he expects \u201can uphill battle for the talks. There is lots of work to do during a short period of time.\u201d \nHe said he expected Trump\u2019s administration to step up protectionism moves to rally his domestic supporters this year. A DIFFERENT APPROACH \nBut South Korea\u2019s trade ministry said that while Washington seeks to significantly change the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, the U.S. wants a \u201cpartial revision\u201d of its deal with Seoul, which will speed up the talks. \n\u201cThey are trying to take a different approach on KORUS FTA from that on the NAFTA,,\u201d Yoo Myung-hee, a director general, told reporters. \nYoo, who led the latest trade talks with U.S., also said \u201call types of auto issues were raised\u201d in Washington, without giving details. \nA top priority for the Americans is maintaining a tariff of 25 percent on imports of Korean pickup trucks, which the existing deal envisaged to be phased out from 2019, sources have said. \nSouth Korean auto companies believe Washington will also seek to increase the 25,000-vehicle per U.S. automaker threshold for shipments to South Korea that can enter the country without meeting Seoul\u2019s domestic safety regulations. South Korea\u2019s vehicle emissions rules are likely to be also on the table, they said. \nThe trade ministry also earlier expected U.S. to demand tougher rules on regional content for the auto sector.

This is the reality.\u201d \nThe Russian defence and foreign ministries did not respond to requests for comment on the talks. Moscow says the reconciliation centre at its air base in Syria routinely holds peace talks with armed factions across the country. \nThe Syrian government\u2019s minister for national reconciliation has said the state intends to get all militants out of eastern Ghouta and restore its full control. \nBut the insurgents want their enemies to observe the truce, which they say includes lifting the siege, opening crossings, and letting dying patients out. It would also involve evacuating the few hundred fighters of al Qaeda\u2019s former Syria branch. \nBoth factions accuse Moscow of not honouring the deals, or turning a blind eye to Syrian army violations. \nDamascus and Moscow say they only target militants. \n\u201cWe send them documentation of how the aircraft drops missiles on residential areas,\u201d said Hamza Birqdar, a military spokesman for the Jaish al-Islam rebels. \n\u201cEither there is silence ... or baseless excuses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say government authorities denied bombing. Then these planes flying over the Ghouta, who do they belong to?\u201d TRUCE PROCESS \nThe conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people and created the world\u2019s worst refugee crisis. Monitors and opposition activists blame Russian bombing for thousands of civilian deaths and much of the destruction - allegations Moscow denies. \nAfter turning the war in favour of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russia has seized the reins of international diplomacy in the past year. It has sought to build a political process outside of failed U.N. peace talks in Geneva. \nOther countries including the United States, meanwhile, have wound down support for the array of mostly Sunni rebels. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin, who first sent warplanes to help Assad in 2015, is pushing for a congress of national dialogue between Syria\u2019s many combatants. \nWith the map of Syria\u2019s conflict redrawn, Russia wants to convert military gains into a settlement that stabilises the shattered nation and secures its interests in the region. \nTo this end, Moscow has been negotiating behind the scenes with armed factions across Syria. Rebel fighters of Jaysh al-Islam sit at their post in Tal Farzat in the besieged rebel-held eastern Ghouta area of Damascus, Syria February 2, 2017. REUTERS\/Bassam Khabieh\/Files \n\u201cWe communicate exclusively with them,\u201d said Birqdar. \u201cBecause in reality, when it comes to Assad and his government, they have become toys in the hands of the Russians. They make no decisions ... except under Russian orders.\u201d \nWith official and secret talks, Russia has built ties to local groups partly to gain influence on the ground, said Yury Barmin, an expert with the Russian International Affairs Council, a think-tank close to the foreign ministry. \n\u201cThere\u2019s one goal. Their inclusion in the truce process,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this is done with the aim of populating these Russian processes, ones led by Russia, with such opposition groups.\u201d \nNO MAN\u2018S LAND \nSince 2013, Syrian government forces and their allies have blockaded eastern Ghouta, a densely populated pocket of satellite towns and farms. \nThe military has suppressed opposition enclaves across western Syria, with the help of Russian air power and Iran-backed Shi\u2018ite militias. Nearly seven years into the war, Assad has repeatedly vowed to take back every inch of Syria. \nThe Ghouta remains the only big rebel enclave near the heavily fortified capital. Slideshow (2 Images) \n\u201cOur communications with the Russian side are through (their) official in Damascus in charge of this file, by phone and in meetings,\u201d said Yasser Delwan, a local Jaish al-Islam political official. \nThey meet Russian forces in no-man\u2019s land, the abandoned farmland between rebel and government territory, at the edge of the nearby Wafideen camp. \n\u201cWe talk about the deal we signed ... implementing it from paper into something practical,\u201d he said. \nBoth rebel forces said Russia instigated the talks. They said Russian officials sometimes blame Iran-backed forces for breaking the truce or use jihadists as a pretext for attacks against the Ghouta. \nFailaq al-Rahman only negotiates with Russian officials outside Syria, said Olwan, their spokesman. \n\u201cIn reality, Russia has never been honest in its support of the political track,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with the failure of the international community ... the factions were forced to negotiate with the enemy.\u201d DE-ESCALATION DEALS \nEastern Ghouta falls under ceasefire plans for rebel territory that Russia has brokered across Syria in the past year, with help from Turkey and Iran. \nWhen the insurgents signed the \u201cde-escalation\u201d deal with Russia last summer, residents and aid workers hoped food would flow into the suburbs, home to around 400,000 people. But they say it has brought no relief. \nDespite lulls in air strikes, the siege got harsher. In some frontline districts, fierce battles rage on. Food, fuel, and medicine have dwindled, especially after the shutdown of smuggling tunnels. \nA Syrian official in Damascus said the army has only retaliated to militants in the suburbs shelling districts of the capital. \u201cAs for the Russian allies, every action takes place on Syrian land in full and total coordination with the Syrian government,\u201d the official said. \u201cThey have a big role.\u201d \nThe Ghouta\u2019s rebel factions, which have long been at odds, say they have no direct contacts with Assad\u2019s government. \n\u201cIn its communications, Russia has always tried to present itself as the solution,\u201d Olwan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see them as mediators. We see them as the final commander in the regime\u2019s ranks.\u201d \nThe Damascus government mostly does not play a role in the talks, said Barmin, the Russia analyst. \u201cDamascus is presented with a fait accompli and must either accept it or not.\u201d Additional reporting by Moscow bureau; Editing by Giles Elgood and Anna Willard"}

Asia ex-Japan shares hit a fresh decade high, hovering close to an all-time record led by gains in South Korea.\nRisk appetite has been whetted by a run of solid data from both developing and emerging economies, confirming the economic expansion is firmly on track.\nThursday\u2019s latest U.S. ADP National Employment Report further boosted the mood, showing private employers added a forecast-beating 250,000 jobs in December, and stoking expectations for key U.S. non-farm payroll data out later on Friday.\nThe upbeat outlook and a tepid dollar also fuelled commodity markets with the Thomson Reuters Core Commodity CRB index at its highest since October 2015 and oil prices holding near the highest levels since May 2015.\n\u201cThat\u2019s providing a macro tailwind for emerging markets \u2013 oil and global trade both speak to stronger emerging markets exports and emerging markets growth, which helps lift people\u2019s expectations on a whole range of EM assets,\u201d said Koon Chow, strategist at UBP.\nCurrencies were trading more mixed on the day but painted an equally upbeat picture for the first trading week of the year.\nTurkey\u2019s lira and Russia\u2019s rouble are on track to end the week around 1 percent stronger against the dollar.\nSouth Africa\u2019s rand eyed an eighth straight week of gains - the longest weekly winning streak since late 2002.\nHowever, analysts thought the cheer may not last, with the latest Reuters poll showing expectations for the rand to weaken by more than 12 percent by end-2018 as the country\u2019s fiscal woes return.\nInspired by the benign backdrop, governments continued to tap international capital markets.

Karadima has denied the allegations and Barros said he was unaware of any wrongdoing. \nThat scandal, which has gripped Chile, and growing secularization, has hurt the Church. \nA poll by Santiago-based think tank Latinobarometro this month showed that the number of Chileans calling themselves Catholics fell to 45 percent last year, from 74 percent in 1995. \nFrancis may speak to it and other problems when he makes his first address on Tuesday morning to national authorities and the diplomatic corps. \nHe then heads to the capital\u2019s sprawling Parque O\u2018Higgins, to say a Mass expected to attract more than 500,000 people. \nWhile in Chile, Francis will likely also face protests from indigenous Mapuche who accuse the state and private companies of taking their ancestral land. \nBachelet last year asked for forgiveness from the Mapuche community for such \u201cerrors and horrors.\u201d \nFrancis flies south to Temuco in Chile\u2019s Araucania region, home of the Mapuche, on Wednesday. \nSeveral churches were attacked in the capital last week, including one with a homemade bomb where unidentified vandals left a pamphlet reading \u201cPope Francis, the next bomb will be in your robe.\u201d \nNo one was injured in the attacks and no one has claimed responsibility. \nShortly before the pontiff\u2019s arrival on Monday, a small group of protesters shut down a street in downtown Santiago, but were quickly dispersed by police. \nSpeaking to reporters aboard the papal plane on the 15-hour flight from Italy, Francis expressed concern about the danger of nuclear war, saying that the world now stood at \u201cthe very limit.\u201d \nHis comment came after Hawaii issued a false missile alert that provoked panic in the U.S. state and highlighted the risk of possible unintended nuclear war with North Korea. \nAsked if he was worried about the possibility of nuclear war, Pope Francis said: \u201cI think we are at the very limit. I am really afraid of this. One accident is enough to precipitate things.\u201d \nHe did not mention Hawaii or North Korea.

We will fight for the rule of law, fight for Hong Kong, fight for the future, fight for the next generations.\u201d\nTwo protesters who dressed up as People\u2019s Liberation Army soldiers said they were concerned about the reach of China\u2019s security apparatus. Others called for full democracy as the only lasting means to safeguard the city\u2019s way of life.\nThe organisers of the march said some 10,000 people had showed up. Police, however, put the figure at 6,200.\nSlideshow (2 Images) The demonstration was largely peaceful, though some protesters who tried to later gather in a forecourt of the government\u2019s headquarters skirmished briefly with security guards.\nThe so-called \u201cCivic Square\u201d was where the 2014 pro-democracy protests first kicked off when a group of protesters stormed over a fence and faced off with local police.\nDespite the defiance on show, some said they feared Hong Kong would continue to be squeezed by Beijing.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s doing what they can,\u201d said Andy Lau who was among the marchers. \u201cIf we have the right to demonstrate then we should. But I\u2018m not feeling positive. I think things will get worse.\u201d\nThe Hong Kong government, in a statement, said it \u201cfully respects the right of Hong Kong people to take part in processions and their freedom of expression\u201d.\nChina\u2019s leader Xi Jinping has said that while Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy under \u201cone country, two systems\u201d, Beijing still holds supreme authority over the city and won\u2019t tolerate any challenge to its authority.\n Chermaine Lee; Writing by James Pomfret; Editing by Adrian Croft\n "}

{"published":"2018-01-21T08:47:00.000+02:00","title":"While political prisoners released, Myanmar's judicial reforms stall","text":"YANGON (Reuters) - Hundreds of political prisoners have been released from Myanmar\u2019s jails in amnesties in recent years, including dozens freed in January 2016, days before democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s party took power for the first time.\nFormer President Barack Obama announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions in October 2016, citing the release of political prisoners and improved human rights as well as the elections that brought Suu Kyi to power. Suu Kyi herself had been under house arrest for 15 years before being released in 2010.\nPrison reform, however, has been put on the back burner under the new government.\nA new prison law was discussed in parliament in 2015, but was not passed. It has not been taken up since then by a new set of lawmakers - most of them from Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy (NLD) - who took their seats in early 2016.\nThe Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a Myanmar group formed by former detainees, says prison reform should include repealing a law that gives police broad powers of arrest and pre-trial detention.\nThe AAPP advocates overhauling vague or outdated rules in the Jail Manual and Penal Code, much of it written during British colonial rule.\nBut the AAPP and rights groups caution that any new legislation on prison reform would not stop politically motivated prosecutions, which would need to be addressed with specific judicial and legal reforms.\nSuu Kyi\u2019s government pardoned, released or dropped charges against hundreds of political prisoners in the month after it took office. But today, 46 people are serving prison sentences for political activities, and another 52 political prisoners are in jail awaiting trial, the AAPP says.\nOTHER PRIORITIES NLD Party spokesman Aung Shin told Reuters prison reform was not yet on the legislative agenda because of other priorities.\n\u201cThere are so many things to do as MPs, it may be a part of the reasons for not including prison reform in the parliament discussions,\u201d Aung Shin said.\nHe also said, however, prisons should be part of a broader examination of legal and judicial reform that the party and legislature was planning. He did not give a time frame for any contemplated legislation.\nAAPP says that 120 former political prisoners from the NLD party are members of the national parliament or regional assemblies.\n\u201cThere are so many former political prisoners in the NLD party, and even in the current parliament,\u201d said Aung Myo Kyaw, head of AAPP\u2019s Yangon office. \u201cIt\u2019s sad they aren\u2019t considering this issue.\u201d\nThe military did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe home affairs ministry says it has improved prison conditions across the country. A ministry report in March said the Correctional Department had relaxed rules on family visits and improved education programs.\nRULE OF LAW Many of the political prisoners, including some today, were jailed in Insein, a 19th-century prison in the north of Yangon that had a notorious reputation for torture, hunger strikes and rioting over inhumane conditions until Myanmar began transitioning to civilian rule in 2011.\nA security officer stands guard in front of Insein Prison in Yangon, Myanmar December 29, 2017. Picture taken December 29, 2017. REUTERS\/Stringer For decades, Insein prison, which has held politicians and poets alongside murderers, thieves and drug dealers, was emblematic of oppressive junta rule and Myanmar\u2019s poor record when it came to the rule of law.\nSome prisoners were kept isolated or were physically and mentally abused while in jail, former inmates say. Amnesty International said misbehaving prisoners, including political prisoners on hunger strike, were still kept shackled in filth in kennels meant for dogs as recently as 2011.\nSuu Kyi herself was briefly held in a hut in the prison compound between spells of house arrest. Leaders of the NLD spent time there before Myanmar\u2019s military rulers started a transition to democracy in 2011 that brought both the release of hundreds of political prisoners and an improvement to prison conditions.\nInsein is where Reuters journalists Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27 have been detained as they face an investigation into whether they breached Myanmar\u2019s Official Secrets Act after the two were detained on Dec. 12.\nBuilt during British colonial rule in the 19th century, Insein covers about 200,000 square meters - larger than New York\u2019s Grand Central station.\nBy some accounts, conditions there have gotten a lot better.\nKyaw Zwa Naing, detained in Insein for two weeks in June after writing a satirical article mocking the military, said \u201cthe prison officers treated us well\u201d.\n\u201cWe could access food supply without limitation. No one threatened us,\u201d he said.\nOVERCROWDED After an inspection in March, the government-backed Myanmar National Human Rights Commission identified overcrowding as a problem and recommended building new dormitories.\n\u201cThe unlucky ones have to sleep right next to the toilet. In Myanmar, we can\u2019t provide international standard cells for inmates,\u201d Commissioner Yu Lwin Aung told Reuters.\nPolitical prisoners and those accused of other non-violent offences are housed with inmates both accused and convicted of violent crimes, according to the AAPP, which regularly interviews recent inmates.\nFamily members say the Reuters reporters each have their own cell and sleep on mats on raised platforms. However, they say the two are fearful because they are being held in the same block as both suspected and convicted criminals.\nMin Tun Soe, a deputy director and spokesperson for the Prison Department said overcrowding was no longer a concern - the prison now houses 12,000 inmates after increasing its capacity to 10,000.\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of reform going on in the prisons, such as new budgets for food supplies, healthcare and education opportunities for inmates, and also reforming the moral behavior of inmates,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe situation is different than it was before,\u201d he said.\nEditing by Bill Tarrant\n "}

It also showed how the body seeks to defend against the damage alcohol can do. \n\u201cSome cancers develop due to DNA damage in stem cells. While some damage occurs by chance, our findings suggest that drinking alcohol can increase the risk of this damage,\u201d said Ketan Patel, a professor at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, who co-led the study. \nThe World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen, citing \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d it causes cancer in humans. \nA study published in 2011 found that alcohol is responsible for around 4 percent of all cancer in Britain - equating to around 12,800 cases a year. Professor Ketan Patel works in the lab at MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, Britain January 2, 2018. Picture taken January 2, 2018. REUTERS\/Chris Radburn \nIn Wednesday\u2019s study, published in the journal Nature, Patel\u2019s team gave diluted alcohol to mice and then analyzed the effect on the animals\u2019 DNA. They found that acetaldehyde can break and damage DNA within blood stem cells, permanently altering the DNA sequences within these cells. \nThis is important, Patel said, because when healthy stem cells become faulty, they can give rise to cancerous cells. Slideshow (7 Images) \nThe researchers also looked at how the body tries to protect itself against damage caused by alcohol. The first line of defense is a group of enzymes called aldehyde dehydrogenases or ALDHs, Patel explained. These break down the acetaldehyde into acetate, which cells can then use as a source of energy. \nIn the study, when mice lacking a critical ALDH enzyme were given alcohol, their DNA suffered four times as damage compared with mice with a properly functioning version of the enzyme. \nPatel said cells also have a second line of defense in the form of a range of DNA repair systems which, most of the time, allow them to fix and reverse different types of DNA damage. \nBut in some instances and in some people - particularly people from South East Asia - the repair systems fail to work, meaning their cells are unable to repair effectively. \n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that alcohol clearance and DNA repair systems are not perfect, and alcohol can still cause cancer in different ways - even in people whose defense mechanisms are intact,\u201d Patel said.

This currently stands at about $544 billion, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com, a website that tracks cryptocurrency prices.\nMuirhead said that during the famous dotcom bubble, where the stock price of internet firms soared, the market cap of companies was \"several trillions.\" In comparison, cryptocurrencies are just over a half a trillion.\n\"The prices might have become a little bit more speculative than perhaps they could be, but you know we see an increasing number of high quality teams coming along and... building interesting applications.

No sitting president has attended the event in nearly two decades, partly to avoid the perception at home of close ties to the wealthy individuals who typically attend.\nFor Trump, at least, the chance to go to Davos and take an economic victory lap has few apparent drawbacks, according to political historians and analysts. With partisans at home well entrenched in their views of the president and leaders abroad already skeptical of him, Trump's trip to mingle with the wealthy and powerful appears to carry less risk than it has for past presidents.\n\"There are so many rules that don't apply to Trump. He's done things that are more problematic [than going to Davos] to people that don't like him this week,\" said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a political risk management firm.\nTrump's plans show chapters Cohn: When the US grows, so does the world 23 Hours Ago | 01:46 Trump will fly to snow-covered Davos overnight Wednesday. A delegation of more than a dozen administration Cabinet officials and advisors, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , has already started to arrive at the event.\nTrump is set to hold bilateral meetings with British Prime Minister Theresa May and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, among others. He is scheduled to meet with European business leaders Thursday and give remarks Friday.\nThe president plans to promote the American business environment in the wake of massive corporate tax cuts and his administration's push to trim regulation on businesses. Despite the elite reputation of the gathering, the White House has tried to cast it as another chance for Trump to look out for working-class Americans.\nTrump wants to \"remind the world that we are open for business,\" his chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn , told reporters Tuesday.\n\"We want the world to invest in America and create jobs for hardworking Americans,\" he added.\nTrump and the 'establishment' show chapters Treasury Secretary Mnuchin: I didn\u2019t realize Davos was \u2018the global elite\u2019 10:37 AM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 | 01:58 Conferring with the political and business leaders attending the forum would appear to contrast with the core messaging of Trump's presidential campaign. Two of the prominent officials attending this year's forum \u2014 Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and German Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2014 appeared in a scathing ad at the end of the Trump campaign in which he pledged to root out corruption in the global \"establishment\" to help overlooked Americans.\nBoth Blankfein and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Wednesday praised Trump's effect on the economy .\nA desire for presidents to be seen as looking out for the interests of typical Americans has generally kept them away from the forum.\n\"Since the late 1990s, globalization has left a bad taste in the mouth of a lot of people in the United States,\" said H.W. Brands, a presidential historian and professor of history at the University of Texas at Austin. \"Even presidents broadly in favor of it think it would make for bad photo ops, to get photographed in this place, in the den of globalization.\"\nBill Clinton was the first and only sitting president to go to Davos. Presidents Barack Obama , George W. Bush or George H.W. Bush never made the trip, at least partly due to its reputation as a haven for wealthy elites.\nObama, known for populist pitches of his own and criticism of Wall Street \"fat cats,\" came into office during the global financial crisis. The younger Bush also had tense relationships with some European allies over his handling of the Iraq War.\nMnuchin recently attempted to distance Trump from the perception that the forum was for globalists, saying he \"didn't realize it was the global elite\" who attended Davos.\nThe goals of the economic forum contrast with the nationalism and protectionism Trump has preached as a candidate and in the White House. The theme of this year's event is \"Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World,\" and one of its goals is to create a \"shared narrative to improve the state of the world.\"\nThe president blamed free trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement for blue-collar job losses. He questioned why the U.S. spends money on wars overseas while its infrastructure suffers and hurts citizens at home. He pulled out of the landmark Paris climate accord, arguing he was elected to represent the people of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\nAll of those arguments are core pieces of his appeal to voters who helped put him in the White House. Yet, experts believe the trip to the epicenter of globalization may not damage Trump with his base at home.\nMost opinion polls have consistently shown roughly 40 percent of Americans support Trump, while at least 50 percent oppose him. Twists and turns in the Russia election meddling investigation, the president's tweeted nuclear threats to North Korea and his widely criticized comments about violence at a white nationalist rally have done little to change voters' opinions.\n\"A lot has happened in the past year. It hasn't fundamentally altered the calculus that he has a pretty solid third of the country behind him and a pretty solid majority of the country deeply opposed to him,\" said Matt Dallek, a political historian and associate professor at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.\nAdditionally, Trump has already faced, and appeared to overcome, concerns about being too close to immense wealth after running a populist campaign. He heard some criticism over his Cabinet choices: for instance, Cohn was Blankfein's right-hand man at Goldman and Mnuchin was a partner at the elite firm. Several other wealthy individuals, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, serve in the president's Cabinet.\nTrump shrugged off those concerns by saying he would rather have successful people helping him make economic decisions.\nBremmer also notes that bipartisan U.S. lawmakers have often attended the World Economic Forum with little apparent blowback. GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, for instance, was in Davos on Wednesday.\n'America First,' but 'not alone' show chapters Cohn: Again, America first, not alone 22 Hours Ago | 01:12 Ahead of Trump's arrival, multiple world leaders at the event warned against protectionism . On Wednesday, Merkel said Germans think \"that shutting ourselves off and isolating ourselves will not lead us into a good future. Protectionism is not the proper answer.\" French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, said \"globalization is going through a major crisis.\"\nInto that group of leaders, Trump brings his \"America First\" message. His presence seems at odds with an event devoted to global integration, experts said.\nAs Trump prepared to leave, the White House tried to counter the perception that his views are incompatible with international cooperation. On Tuesday, Cohn contended that \"America First\" does not mean America \"alone.\"\nMnuchin echoed the sentiment Wednesday. He told reporters in Davos that \"'America first' does mean working with the rest of the world.\"\nCohn also said that Trump believes in trade as long as he deems it \"fair.\"\n\"The president will continue to promote fair economic competition and will make it clear that there cannot be free and open trade if countries are not held accountable to the rules,\" he said.\nObservers said Trump's private comments to world leaders and the tone of his remarks Friday will bear out whether he went to Davos to stir the pot or make nice.\nSaid historian Brands, \"It may be a case of, he's going to stick a finger in the eye of the globalizers right in the lion's den.\"\nWATCH: Cohn says Trump wants everyone at Davos to understand what he's accomplished show chapters Cohn: Trump wants everyone in Davos to understand what he's accomplished 19 Hours Ago | 01:29"}

And, there's no guarantee a military strike by the U.S. won't result in a wider conflict or war on the Korean Peninsula.\n\"Seoul has very strong concerns about the potential for a U.S. 'preventive attack' on North Korea,\" said Bruce Klingner, former chief of the CIA Korea division and now senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Washington-based conservative think Heritage Foundation.\nshow chapters If President Trump were to order a nuclear strike, here\u2019s what would happen 11:01 AM ET Wed, 11 Oct 2017 | 01:33 Adding to the anxiety is \"nuclear button\" rhetoric this month from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump as well as news reports that the White House is considering a possible pre-emptive \"bloody nose\" strike on North Korean missile facilities.\n\"Whatever we want to call it, war footing or not, a strike on North Korea has always been one of the options that various U.S. administrations have had in their toolbox,\" said Benjamin Silberstein, associate scholar at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute.\nPossible catalysts for the limited strike against North Korea could include the regime launching another intercontinental ballistic missile test or an atmospheric hydrogen bomb test, which it threatened to do last year.\nExperts say the springtime historically has been an active period of missile testing by Pyongyang, when the regime complains about massive U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises.\nshow chapters Bitcoin mining \u2014 a new way for North Korea to make money 9:37 AM ET Wed, 13 Sept 2017 | 03:43 The upcoming war games known as Foal Eagle and Key Resolve are set to get underway after the Olympics and involve American and South Korean ships, tanks and aircraft as well as live-fire exercises and more than 230,000 combined troops. The North Koreans view the war drills as provocative because they contain simulated elements sometimes described as \"decapitation strikes\" by special forces that target the regime's leadership.\nSome proponents of the Trump administration's limited-strike option contend that the North Koreans might actually hold back from any military response out of fear that the risks of doing so are too great because it could produce a massive response from Washington and perhaps be fatal to the Kim regime. Yet others disagree, saying the North Korea leader would look bad if he didn't respond since the regime has blamed the U.S. for crippling international sanctions and its other problems. They also contend that a faction of the military could act on its own if Kim failed to order a military response.\n\"Kim would have no choice but to respond back or he'd face the possibility of a coup,\" said Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, a U.S. think tank. \"And maybe even respond more ferociously than we attack him.\"\nshow chapters These fallout shelters won't save you if there's a nuclear attack 2:29 PM ET Fri, 6 Oct 2017 | 02:58 Any retaliation could potentially pose a threat to the greater Seoul area, where about half of the South Korean population lives. North Koreans are known to have thousands of hardened artillery sites, including some dug into mountains, along the Korean DMZ and within range of Seoul.\nKlingner, the former CIA official, just returned from a trip to South Korea where he heard firsthand the concerns of senior officials. He said the unanimous view is that even a limited strike would certainly trigger a response from the North Koreans.\n\"Some are suggesting that the U.S. is thinking of hitting two or three targets, and that North Korea would likely respond proportionately,\" Klingner said. \"Not the all-out artillery barrage on Seoul.\"\nStill, he said there are scenarios where a limited strike by Washington could result in a larger response by the North Korean military.\nAnother wildcard is what China would do if the U.S. were to conduct a strike against North Korea. An editorial last year in China's semi-official Global Times newspaper suggested Beijing might help North Korea if Washington launched a pre-emptive attack.\nChina was noticeably absent last week when diplomats from 20 countries met in Vancouver, British Columbia, to discuss the North Korean nuclear threat and international sanctions.\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson was asked at the meeting whether there might soon be military conflict with Pyongyang and responded: \"I think we all need to be very sober and clear-eyed about the current situation. We have to recognize that the threat is growing. And if North Korea does not choose the path of engagement, of discussion, negotiations, then they themselves will trigger an option.\"\nSome are critical of the Trump administration for giving mixed messages on North Korea and for what some call \"loose talk\" on military options. For example, Trump last year appeared to undercut diplomatic efforts by Tillerson by tweeting, \"Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!\"\n\"Mixed messages from the United States toward North Korea has plagued the Trump administration efforts to reduce the threat posed by the North's nuclear program from Day One,\" said Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, a nonpartisan disarmament group based in Washington.\nAccording to Davenport, the \"uptick in loose talk\" about a possible \"preventive strike\" risks hurting the momentum created by the inter-Korean talks over the Olympics and to advance diplomatic efforts and the denuclearization goal. Also, she said, \"loose talk of 'preventative war' also is dangerous because it increases the likelihood of miscalculation or inadvertent escalation in the region.\"\nRegardless, many don't see the North Korean leader giving up his nuclear weapons anytime soon. They say the regime is well aware of what happened with Libya's Moammar Gadhafi when he gave up his nuclear weapon ambitions after facing Western pressure.\n\"They've been very clear that they have no intention ... to give up 1 inch on their nuclear weapons development,\" said Silberstein. \"That's still where we're at, regardless of how many North Korean athletes come to Pyeongchang.\"\nWATCH: Here's what a land war with North Korea could look like show chapters Here's what a land war with North Korea could look like 8:38 AM ET Tue, 29 Aug 2017 | 02:20"}

We\u2019ve been on top in some games, if not all the games at some stage. They\u2019ve just played those pressurised moments better than us.\u201d \nThe tourists will also take pride from refusing to buckle despite being outclassed in four of the five tests and Root\u2019s determination to bat on Monday typified their fighting spirit. \nThe 27-year-old was 42 not out with England 93 for four at close of play on day four but he experienced diarrhoea and vomiting overnight and was taken to hospital for treatment. \nRoot received an ovation when he came out to resume his innings and had soon secured his 37th test half century with three runs to fine leg. \nHe suffered a recurrence of the symptoms during the lunch break, though, and Tom Curran came out to bat in his place, leaving Root retired hurt for 58 and sleeping in the dressing room when Australia paraded the tiny trophy. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a few weeks they\u2019re going to lift the urn, but seeing them do it in person is tough to watch,\u201d said Anderson. \n\u201cAll the guys in the dressing room are hurting.

Yonhap via REUTERS The inter-Korean Liaison Office at the heart of this new spurt of dialogue between the two sides, sits at the Joint Security Area in Panmunjom, the only spot along the heavily fortified demilitarized zone that divides North and South Korea where troops from both sides stand face to face.\nIf the telephone operators wanted to, they could step out of their office and talk to their counterparts only 80 meters (260 feet) away in a separate building across the demarcation line.\n\u201cLike what happened today (Friday), we mostly exchange what we call a \u2018telephone notice,\u2019 which basically means that a liaison officer calls the other side and reads a document carrying a proposal or official position on the other\u2019s proposal,\u201d said a senior official with South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Unification, which mans the phone and fax lines at the office.\n\u201cBut other times, say, if you need to deliver a document with official seals, you would call them to arrange a face-to-face meeting at a certain time on the demarcation line.\u201d\nThat happened on a regular basis in the past, when relations were better, the official said, and now Seoul is hoping that these new high-level talks, scheduled for January 9, may bring back an era of more cordial relations between the two Koreas.\n\u201cA VERY DELICATE JOB\u201d\nNorth Korean officials had effectively not answered the phone at Panmunjom since February 2016. During that time, South Korean officials would sometimes use a bull horn to shout messages across the border.\nFor the first time in nearly two years, the hotline was used on Wednesday. On the orders of leader Kim Jong Un, a North Korean official called the South in a preliminary step to a formal dialogue.\nOfficials have released few details of that conversation and several others that have since occurred, although some were decidedly anticlimactic.\nAfter several calls on Wednesday, a North Korean official called to check the line. When the South\u2019s officer asked if the North had anything new to say, the official on the other end of the line said \u201cno\u201d and hung up, according to the Ministry of Unification.\nA North Korean flag flutters on the top of their guard post inside North Korean territory in this picture taken near the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas in Paju, South Korea.

The currency is particularly politically sensitive, and its price action is in response to concerns around U.S. policy.\u2022 The government shutdown resolution may indeed fail to pass as tension across political parties remains.\u2022 A further decline in the dollar could be a warning sign of weakness to come in stocks, though this was not evident on Wednesday as stocks ended in positive territory. Bottom line: Political uncertainty in the U.S. and abroad has the potential to rattle markets this week, according to one currency expert."}

Gene Biotherapeutics is actively pursuing the acquisition of clinical development and commercialization rights to new and innovative, late-stage, DNA-based product opportunities focused on multiple forms of cancer to leverage the company's established and validated adenovector-based technology platform and deep experience in the clinical advancement and commercialization of gene therapy product candidates.\nPreviously, the Company established Angionetics Inc., an 85% majority-owned subsidiary, to lead Gene Biotherapeutics' cardiovascular clinical research and commercialization activities. Angionetics is currently focused on independent financings to support advancement of the FDA-cleared, Generx AFFIRM Phase 3 clinical study of patients with refractory angina (myocardial ischemia) due to advanced coronary artery disease. There are an estimated 1.0 million patients with refractory angina in the United States. Gene Biotherapeutics' plan to advance forward to establish Angionetics as an independent company remains unchanged. As previously reported, Gene Biotherapeutics expects to retain a substantial long-term equity investment in Angionetics following completion of the planned external financings. For more information about the Generx AFFIRM Phase 3 clinical study visit www.MyRefractoryAngina.com .\nAngionetics is also considering the initiation of multiple Phase 2 clinical studies to evaluate the Generx angiogenic gene therapy product candidate as a treatment for patients with Cardiac Syndrome X (microvascular dysfunction) and certain forms of congestive heart failure, including ischemic cardiomyopathy.\nAngionetics' Generx [Ad5FGF-4] is a first in class, disease altering, one-time administered, late-stage, angiogenic gene therapy product candidate which has been biologically engineered to enhance blood flow (perfusion) in ischemic regions of the heart by leveraging cardiac plasticity to promote the natural formation and growth of microvascular coronary structures (collateral vessels). This is achieved by stimulating and augmenting the heart's innate natural capacity to modulate the enlargement of pre-existing collateral arterioles (arteriogenesis), and to form new capillary vessels (angiogenesis) in select ischemic regions downstream from large coronary arteries.\nAngionetics is being uniquely positioned to become a leading molecular interventional cardiology company, and is seeking to develop a portfolio of new and innovative, single-treatment, gene-based, catheter-administered therapeutic products focused on the biologic modulation of cardiac conductivity, contraction and angiogenic revascularization to address the global unmet medical needs of millions of patients with multiple forms of heart disease. Consistent with Angionetics' business strategy, the company is currently considering the acquisition of several early-stage gene therapy product candidates. To learn more about Angionetics visit www.angionetics.com .\nAs previously reported, Gene Biotherapeutics further plans to monetize its FDA-cleared, U.S.-patented, Excellagen, a highly-purified, aseptically-manufactured, fibrillar bovine collagen [2.6%] flowable dermal matrix for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic lower extremity ulcers, pressure and venous ulcers as well as other wound healing applications. Excellagen has demonstrated its medical utility as a delivery platform for stem cells, and also carries the potential as a topical dermal delivery vehicle for small molecule drugs, peptides, proteins, and exosomes.

{"published":"2018-01-26T20:55:00.000+02:00","title":"The dollar's terrible week is a warning of what could come if Trump's team missteps on trade","text":"U.S. officials created a small firestorm with their dollar comments in the chilly air of Davos this week, but a much more important factor for the future of the currency will be what they say and do about trade when they leave Switzerland.\nStrategists say the dollar could consolidate now after its latest bout of weakness, and the focus will now be on whether the Trump administration can pursue its goal of new, fair trade agreements without sparking trade wars and new currency volatility.\nThe dollar index has been in a year-long decline, defying forecasts that it should strengthen from the fact that the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and normalizing monetary policy faster than its counterparts. But the opposite has happened, and the dollar weakened as flows increased into the euro and yen, as those economies improved, and central bankers in Europe and Japan look closer to removing their own heavy handed accommodation.\nThen this week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stirred the pot, with a possibly innocuous comment to journalists at the annual World Economic Forum about dollar weakness being good for U.S. trade. To markets, that sounded like a not very subtle endorsement of the falling dollar and a step away from the long-running U.S. policy of verbally supporting a strong dollar. The comment also took on more significance since it was made at the Davos confab, dubbed the 'epicenter of globalization' by one strategist.\n\"The dollar had a terrible start to the year way before Mnuchin came in and made those comments. The trend didn't come from that, so we obviously had some volatility down and up this week on the back and forth from that. I don't think the trend is about that. It's about global growth, about the shift in some capital flows, such as Chinese capital flows, and that's separate from whatever that one sentence comment was that was made by Mnuchin and others,\" said Jens Nordvig, CEO of Exante Data.\nMnuchin's comments also came just as the U.S. launched trade sanctions against Chinese solar panels and South Korean washing machines . Crucial trade talks were also underway this week in Canada, as the U.S., Mexico and Canada try to reshape the 24-year-old NAFTA agreement. The Treasury secretary's comments triggered not so subtle criticism from Europe's central bank head Mario Draghi about unnamed officials talking down their currency.\nMnuchin and later President Donald Trump tried to walk back the weak dollar comments. Trump triggered a temporary rally in the dollar Thursday, when he said on CNBC that Mnuchin's comment was taken out of context and the dollar should get stronger with the U.S. economy. On Friday, Mnuchin, also on CNBC, used some of the exact language of his predecessors\u2014that a strong dollar was in the \"best interests\" of the country.\nBut the market continues to sell the dollar, and some strategists expect that to continue this year, even after a period of possible consolidation. The dollar index touched a new three-year low Friday.\nIt could accelerate if Trump takes broader trade actions that are seen as protectionist.\nAdam Galica | CNBC Steven Mnuchin interviewed by CNBC at Davos, Switzerland, January 26, 2018 \"The next focus for markets is whether Trump pivots to a much more protectionist, isolationist policy, or he tries to play a little bit better in the global game,\" said Mark McCormick, North America head of foreign exchange strategy at TD Securities.\nTrump, in the past, has kicked off his own dollar selloff. Just before his inauguration, he discussed how he liked a weaker dollar, and the dollar index has lost more than 11 percent since then. A weak dollar is a double-edged sword\u2014 good for multinational profits and selling U.S. goods abroad but bad for U.S. dollar assets, like Treasurys.\n\"The tone we got this week was the dollar was front and center for Davos. You've had back and forth on Mnuchin and Trump and Mnuchin again on what actual dollar policy is. I think everyone's fully aware Trump has had a preference for a weaker dollar, whether there's anything they can do or not to accelerate it,\" said McCormick. \"It's clear they have a focus on bilateral trade deficits.\"\nTrump did promote his 'America first' policies at Davos, and in a speech said that does not mean America goes it alone. He also said the U.S. was looking for fair trade, as he touted the growth of the U.S. economy, the stock market's performance, the new GOP tax law and the fact that the U.S. is 'open for business.'\n\"It's the most important thing to watch,\" said Nordvig of evolving U.S. trade policy. He said if NAFTA is dissolved, it would be an immediate negative for the peso but the dollar would lose flows to Europe and Japan. It would also be negative for the record setting stock market.\n\"We saw the solar stuff this week. It was expected. The next thing to watch is the next installment. It's pretty unpredictable,\" said Nordvig. U.S. officials have warned other actions are coming.\nAlan Ruskin, Deutsche Bank head of G-10 currency strategy, sees some consolidation after the dollar's fall and the sharp increase in the euro, up 1.7 percent this week. But he too says the markets are keeping a close eye on trade, and whether the Trump administration makes moves beyond the actions its already taken on specific products.\n\"What we've been looking for is a shift back to the point where rates matter and carry matters. So far, we haven't seen that for quite some time. There are a lot of different balls in the air, as far as currencies are concerned,\" said Ruskin. \"There's trade related issues coming to the fore now, particularly as they relate to the U.S. and China. This is an opening gambit. There's a bigger story in the background.\" Ruskin said the market is watching the U.S. trade relationship with China, and the fact the U.S. has significant issues with China, including on intellectual property rights.\nNordvig said the currency market has been making some interesting moves when it comes to China. \"\n\"What's really remarkable, in the last month we've had a big move in the dollar. We had a big move in the dollar against a lot of crosses. China had a big move, and we track the invention and thers' no intervention whatsoever. This is alike a historic thing because they used to always intervene when the currency was getting stronger. The fact they are not doing anything is a very big deal,\" he said, noting countries are very careful now about being interventionalist. \"I think they realize if they want to have a reserve currency over time, they want to have a flexible currency. If they stop their appreciation, there's one way risk. It can only go down. I think they want to have two-way risk.\"\nAs the dollar flounders, the market has focused on the fact that other currencies, like the euro and yen are becoming more attractive as reserve currencies, though the U.S. is so important it is not expected to lose its reserve status.\nBut the concern has been that dollar assets could lose their appeal if the dollar becomes too weak, if the Trump administration really does want to talk down the green back. McCormick said there was some speculation that the Trump administration weak dollar comments were a response to the reports earlier this month that China was considering cutting back on Treasury purchases because they are no longer as attractive and because of Trump trade policies. China is the largest holder of Treasurys, but it's not expected to back out of the Treasury markets in a significant way.\n\"I think if they started to pick a trade war with China that would be super dollar negative against euro and yen. But high beta currencies, like emerging market currencies , would also not perform well in that environment,\" McCormick said.\nHe said NAFTA is a test case for how the U.S. may behave on the broader world stage. \"It will be interesting to see how Trump goes back home to a different audience, how he talks on trade whether he is more bellicose,\" said McCormick, adding the upcoming Congressional midterm elections may shape how Trump talks about trading partners.\nTrump gave a surprise nod to the possibility of U.S. joining a multilateral trade deal when he has pushed the idea of bilateral deals when he said he reconsidering joining the Trans Pacific Partnership. Trump withdrew from the multilateral trade pact last year and says he'd reconsider if the U.S. could get a better deal, but analysts were skeptical anything would come of that."}

Teleperformance has worked with Apple Inc, and said on its website that its El Salvador location serves seven international clients, mainly from the United States.\nRamos, whose misdemeanor offense in the United States fell short of the kind of crimes that disqualify some potential call center employees, earns $600 a month. That is just over half of what he made in the United States but double El Salvador's minimum wage.\nHe said he felt safe working in an office rather than a street environment. Tattoos he wore openly in California could be misinterpreted as gang-related in El Salvador and make him a target for attack, he said.\n\"The economic situation is a bit better than what you can make anywhere else, and the environment is safe,\" he said.\n\"FAST GROWTH\"\nSome Salvadorans fled to the United States during its 1980s civil war. Others came later, feeling violence, poverty and natural disasters. Many gained temporary protected status (TPS) following destructive earthquakes in 2001, allowing them to live and work legally in the United States.\nIt is unknown how many Salvadorans will return home after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to cancel TPS from September 2019 gave them 18 months to leave or seek lawful residency.\nSome call center executives foresee a larger pool of talent as a consequence of the move.\n\"There is certainly going to be enough momentum that there is going to be very fast growth,\" said Jorge Orellana, who oversees Contacto Tu Call Center in San Salvador where 250 employees service U.S. insurance, emergency and finance firms.\nBoth local and foreign companies have taken advantage of El Salvador's English-speaking workers, proximity to the United States and low labor and operational costs, he added.\nFor U.S. clients the location has been an attractive option compared with more distant outsourcing hubs like India and the Philippines.\nThe industry has also landed in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama.\n\"This happened in Mexico when young people who had grown up in the U.S. started coming back to Mexico, and it would be surprising if something similar doesn't happen in El Salvador,\" said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington.\nFor some deportees, the call center industry, which El Salvador's investment promotion agency (PROESA) says employs 25,000 people, is not an option because their U.S. police records raise security concerns with clients.\nWilliam Lopez, 51, was deported just over a year ago from California, where he lived for four decades until being convicted of domestic violence. He denies the charge.\nThe stain on his record has stopped Lopez securing call center jobs but the father of two now works with a non-profit training other deportees for such work.\n\"We're expecting many people with the suspension of TPS... I think some of the best jobs that exist here are call centers. It's clean work, well organized and the salary isn't bad for pay in this country,\" he said.

Reports that a software fix would slow the performance of affected PCs contributed to the strong reaction. \nBut in a mid-afternoon statement, Intel (intc) said the early reports were wrong. And mobile chip designer ARM Holdings said its chips were also affected and that it was working with Intel and AMD (amd) on a fix. That helped Intel shares claw back some of the drop and the stock closed down only 3%, while AMD ended with a 5% gain. \n\u201cRecent reports that these exploits are caused by a \u201cbug\u201d or a \u201cflaw\u201d and are unique to Intel products are incorrect,\u201d Intel said. \u201cBased on the analysis to date, many types of computing devices \u2014 with many different vendors\u2019 processors and operating systems \u2014 are susceptible to these exploits.\u201d \nARM, which is owned by SoftBank Group, said in a statement: \u201cARM have been working with Intel and AMD to devise mitigation for a new method identified by security researchers that can exploit certain high-end processors, including ours\u2026Software mitigation measures have already been shared with our partners. ARM takes all security threats seriously and we encourage individual users to ensure their software is up-to-date and always practice good security hygiene.\u201d \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. \nAMD said its chips were affected by some but not all of a series of related security exploits uncovered by researchers. AMD has already developed a simple software fix for its chips that will not impact PC performance, an AMD spokesman said. \u201cDue to differences in AMD\u2019s architecture, we believe there is a near zero risk to AMD processors at this time,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe expect the security research to be published later today and will provide further updates at that time.\u201d \nThe problem arose in the software that runs the core processing center on Intel chips, known as the kernel. Researchers found that programs running on a PC could gain access to parts of the kernel\u2019s stored memory that were supposed to be off limits. That could allow a malicious hacker to read confidential information like passwords or data files cached in memory, the tech news site The Register reported . \nSome of the confusion resulted from the fact that researchers at Google (googl) had found several different exploits to crack the kernel\u2019s protected data, but had not published their full findings when some of the details began to leak. One exploit with two variations, dubbed Spectre, impacts virtually all major chip lines, while another, called Meltdown, is limited to Intel\u2019s chips. \nIntel said it had already begun distributing software fixes to eliminate the issue and denied that the patches would noticeably hamper the performance of affected systems. \u201cContrary to some reports, any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time,\u201d Intel said.

That includes more than three million Americans, only half of whom are aware they have the disease, according to the Glaucoma Research Foundation. \nCoffee, or caffeine in general have previously been linked to increased glaucoma risk, although recent studies don\u2019t agree, Coleman and her colleagues write. \nTo evaluate the relationship between specific caffeinated drinks and glaucoma, Coleman and colleagues analyzed data on a sample of more than 10,000 people in the U.S. who were representative of the entire population. Participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 2005-2006 answered questions about their diets and lifestyles, had medical exams and blood tests and also underwent eye examinations. \nAbout 1,700 participants were over age 40, had no other known eye diseases and had full eye examination results from the survey. In this group, Coleman\u2019s team found that just over 5 percent, 82 people, had glaucoma. \nAlmost half of participants reported drinking coffee often, but less than 10 percent drank hot tea daily. The research team found no associations between coffee, iced tea, decaffeinated tea or soft drink consumption and the likelihood of having glaucoma. \n\u201cTea drinkers should keep drinking and don\u2019t need to stop because of a fear of glaucoma,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cThis makes sense, but we\u2019ll see if it holds up in future studies.\u201d \nFuture studies should look at the habits, activities and nutrition that affect lifestyle and glaucoma risks, said Idan Hecht of Tel-Aviv University in Israel, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. \n\u201cIn the past few years, there has been a tremendous increase in interest, and subsequently research, into the ways lifestyle changes can influence diseases,\u201d Hecht told Reuters Health by email. \nRecent research indicates that vitamins C, E and zinc can help vision. Other studies indicate that antioxidants in tea could have similar effects, he noted. \n\u201cPatients can and should be involved and take an active role in the management of their ailments,\u201d Hecht said. \u201cExercising, eating healthy and trying novel ways to improve your health is something you should definitely explore and bring up with your physician.\u201d \nEnvironmental factors could play a role in glaucoma risk as well, said Dr. Ahmad Aref at the University of Illinois at Chicago. \n\u201cAs our population grows older, we need to think about the other factors that could help, particularly when it comes to the health benefits of physical activity,\u201d he told Reuters Health by phone. \nOverall, both medical and non-medical approaches are key to treating the disease in the future, Aref added. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough disease because we don\u2019t have a way to bring vision back once it\u2019s lost,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we can do is prevent it from getting worse, and we want to help patients do that.\u201d \nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2Bszp7c British Journal of Ophthalmology, online December 14, 2017."}

Activision has seen a 76 percent rise while rivals Take-Two and EA have also skyrocketed 129 percent and 42 percent, respectively, in that time. The rally in the space has been driven by strong video game sales and the growing esports industry, one Activision is now heavily involved in with Wednesday's launch of the company's Overwatch game esports franchise league. \nBut aside from strong fundamentals, Gordon also sees an Activision breakout out from a technical standpoint. \n\"There's a good breakout going here through the $68 level,\" he said Thursday on CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\" \"I'd like to take advantage of continued upside here in Activision as we break through $68.\" \nTo play for the breakout, Gordon suggested buying the February 67.5\/72.5 call spread for $2.25, or $225 per options spread. This is a bullish strategy where someone will buy a call and sell a higher strike call of the same expiration to offset the cost. The goal is for the stock to rise above that lower strike call by more than the cost of the trade, or in this case above $69.75 by Feb. 16. \nBut Gordon is also keeping his eye out for the company's earnings report on Feb. 8. \n\"Earnings are on Feb. 8, so if we have a nice comfortable margin in this trade, go ahead and carry it through,\" he said. \"If we don't and you want to book profits ahead of earnings on Feb. 8, cut the trade.\" \nActivision has rallied more than 9 percent since the start of the year, fueled this week by the Overwatch League's launch."}

Its Governor Adam Glapinski reiterated that he saw no need for a change in rates this year, adding that they may stay on hold even after 2018. Those comments were not a surprising as December inflation figures were benign. The zloty, instead of weakening, firmed 0.15 percent against the euro by 1541 GMT, to 4.1766. It benefitted from dollar selling after a report that China was ready to slow or halt its U.S. treasury purchases. Central European government bonds followed a rise in U.S. bond yields. Central Europe's most liquid currencies have tracked the dollar's movements this year. Dollar weakness helped the zloty hit a 2-1\/2-year high on Friday. Erste analyst Katarzyna Rzentarzewska said the NBP could bring forward rate hikes if demand driven by wages and a tight labour market starts to boost inflation from the middle of 2018. \"We currently see the possibility of the first rate hike in the fourth quarter of 2018, if inflation expectations keep increasing and overshooting of inflation target becomes highly likely,\" she said in a note. A surge in wages has fuelled a rebound in inflation in the region since 2016, but so far only the Czech and the Romanian central banks have started to raise rates from record-low levels. The Romanian bank's (NBR) first hike in a decade, delivered on Tuesday, gave a short-lived lift to the leu, but its comments indicating leniency on some weakness sent the currency lower. It consolidated on Wednesday, trading at 4.641 against the euro, up 0.1 percent. The crown eased slightly after Czech National Bank Governor Jiri Rusnok said he expected at least two more rate hikes by 25 basis points each this year, and December data showed 2.4 percent annual inflation, in line with forecasts. New Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, battling allegations his business empire illegally tapped EU subsidies a decade ago, looks certain to lose a parliamentary confidence vote on Wednesday.

FILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May visits Frimley Park Hospital near Camberley, Britain, January 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Toby Melville \nEarlier this week, officials at the National Health Service (NHS) in England recommended that hospitals cancel all non-urgent appointments and operations until next month. \nMay, during a visit to a hospital outside London, said she recognized it is frustrating for patients who had their operations postponed. \n\u201cI know it is difficult, I know it is frustrating, I know it is disappointing for people and I apologize,\u201d she told Sky News. \nA flu outbreak, colder weather and high levels of respiratory illnesses have put hospitals in England under strain with many operating at or near full capacity. \nThe issue is potentially damaging for May, already weakened after losing a parliamentary majority in last year\u2019s election and struggling to pacify her deeply divided party as she navigates the final year of Brexit negotiations. \nThe NHS, which delivers free care for all and accounts for a third of government spending on public services, is typically one of the most important issues for voters during elections and one which is often regarded as a weakness for May\u2019s Conservative party. \nOpposition parties regularly accuse the government of failing to adequately fund the health service. A patient is pushed down a corridor in Frimley Park Hospital near Camberley, Britain, January 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Toby Melville \n\u201cMinisters refused to provide the funding top NHS officials said was necessary and now patients are paying the price,\u201d said Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats. \nFounded in 1948 by the opposition Labour Party, the NHS is a source of huge pride for many Britons who are able to access free care from cradle to grave. \nBut tight budgets, an aging population and increasingly complex medical needs have left many hospitals struggling during the winter in recent years. Slideshow (4 Images) \nThe pressure continues to grow, according to new data on Thursday. \nThe number of patients stuck in ambulances for at least an hour almost doubled to more 4,700 cases during the Christmas week compared with the week before. \nDepartment of Health guidelines say ambulance crews should be able to hand patients over to hospital staff within 15 minutes of arrival at hospital. \nThe average bed occupancy for the Christmas week was 91.7 percent. Doctors say that anything above 85 percent is unsafe. \nThe conditions have led some doctors taking to Twitter to vent their frustrations. \nOne London-based doctor wrote that conditions were so bad that he was practicing \u201cbattlefield medicine\u201d, while another apologized for the \u201c3rd world conditions\u201d caused by overcrowding.

The percentage decrease was the largest since August 2016.\nNovember's sales pace was revised down to 689,000 units, still the strongest performance since July 2007, from the previously reported 733,000 units.\nUnseasonably cold temperatures at the end of December probably also hurt sales. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for 10.1 percent of the housing market, tumbling 7.9 percent to a pace of 679,000 units last month.\nNew home sales, which are drawn from permits, are volatile on a month-to-month basis. Sales plunged 9.8 percent in the South last month after jumping 6.6 percent in November amid reconstruction efforts following the devastation caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Sales fell 10 percent in the Midwest last month.\nNew home sales surged 14.1 percent from a year ago. They increased 8.3 percent in 2017 to 608,000 units.\nA strong labor market, which is near full employment, has unleashed demand for housing that has not been matched with an increase in supply. As a result, house price inflation has outpaced wage growth, pricing some first-time home buyers out of the market.\nA report on Wednesday showed sales of previously owned homes declined 3.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57 million units last month as inventory of houses dropped to a record low.\nIn December, there were 295,000 new homes on the market, an increase of 3.9 percent and the highest level since April 2009. The stock of new home sales still remains well below its peak during the housing market bubble. At December's sales pace it would take 5.7 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 4.9 months in November.\nA six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand."}

REUTERS\/Amit Dave\/Files Last month the United States triggered a new round of litigation at the WTO, arguing that India had failed to abide by a ruling that it had illegally discriminated against foreign suppliers of solar cells and modules.\nIn a statement published by the WTO on Monday, India said it had changed its rules to conform with the ruling and that a U.S. claim for punitive trade sanctions was groundless.\n\u201cIndia underscores that the United States\u2019 request is not a valid request,\u201d the Indian statement said.\nIt said Washington had skipped legal steps, failed to follow the correct WTO procedure, and omitted to mention any specific level of trade sanctions that it proposed to level on India, leaving India \u201cseverely prejudiced\u201d.\nIndia would be vindicated if the proper process was followed, it said.\n\u201cIn view of the above, India strongly objects to the U.S. request of 19 December 2017,\u201d it said.\nRenewable energy has become an area of severe trade friction as major economies compete to dominate a sector that is expected to thrive as reliance on coal and oil dwindles.\nIndia unveiled its national solar programme in 2011, seeking to ease chronic energy shortages in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy without creating pollution.\nBut the United States complained to the WTO in 2013, saying U.S. solar exports to India had fallen by 90 percent.

A wall of shelves in the Reuters section of the press room at the Supreme Court is overflowing with thousands of thick legal briefs (a misnomer of the highest order), documenting cases working their way up through the U.S. court system.\nLast November, the Supreme Court made a big technological leap and began sharing case materials on its website so those stacks of multi-colored briefs could disappear. However, the intense planning for the upcoming session will not change.\nThe court divides its work by terms, running from October to June. The justices are back at work for a new round of oral arguments on Jan. 8.\nOne mission-critical task for reporters on the beat is carefully considering the importance and impact of each case coming to the court. Making those decisions early gives them a jump on reporting that needs to be ready for the day a decision is announced.\nCoverage of each Supreme Court session is divided into three key areas: announcements on new cases the justices will hear, oral arguments and rulings. Reuters is present when the nine Supreme Court Justices hear oral arguments, sitting in the second row of the courtroom to the left of the bench near Justice Elena Kagan.\nFor ruling announcements, reporters receive actual copies of court opinions in the court\u2019s public information office. \u201cThe time pressure is very real to be first and accurate,\u201d says Lawrence Hurley, who has been covering the court for Reuters for the past five years.\nMost closely watched are rulings on cases argued in the previous session. Reporters pre-write stories with various outcomes, and the multimedia team creates graphics with different scenarios, so they are ready to be published when a ruling is made.\nSo far this term, which began in October, the Supreme Court has issued one ruling. Hurley and colleague Andrew Chung are watching for decisions on several high-profile cases, including President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban policy, which could soon return to the court, and that of a Christian baker who refused to make a cake for a gay couple.\nBackstory To our readers, from the Editor-in-Chief Read about Reuters Backstory and the Trust Principles During the January 2018 session, Hurley says Reuters will pay close attention to oral arguments over an Ohio voting law that was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union, which claimed the law violated individual voting rights. The case involves Ohio\u2019s appeal of a lower court ruling that blocked the Republican-led state\u2019s policy of purging people from voter-registration lists if they do not regularly cast ballots.\nHurley says the Supreme Court beat is one the broadest and most interesting at Reuters.\n\u201cYou\u2019re covering immigration, gay rights, criminal justice issues, the conflict between White House and other branches of government as well as the states,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the big issues that are dividing the country at any given time nearly always end up here.\u201d\nReporting By Lauren Young; Editing by Toni Reinhold\n "}

It has exceeded 10 percent in elections since and took 11.9 percent in the November 2015 vote. \nFounded by an ex-colonel involved in a 1960 military coup, the MHP espouses a mix of Turkish nationalism and scepticism towards the West. It is virulently opposed to autonomy for Turkey\u2019s Kurdish minority. \nThe MHP support base once included sympathisers of the \u201cGrey Wolves\u201d, a nationalist youth group that fought street battles with leftists in the 1970s.

REUTERS\/Kai Pfaffenbach \nThe bank warned on Friday that weak trading, low client activity and a 1.5 billion euro ($1.8 billion) negative impact from a tax overhaul in the United States would result in a \u201csmall\u201d loss for the full year. \nCEO John Cryan has cautioned that the bank\u2019s turnaround would be a long, hard slog but said in July he expected a return to profit in 2017. \nThe bank\u2019s announcement took investors by surprise and its shares fell sharply, closing 5.2 percent down. \n\u201cThe share price reaction speaks for itself,\u201d said a trader in Frankfurt. \u201cInvestors are disappointed.\u201d \nIn March, Deutsche announced an overhaul that included integrating its Postbank retail bank with its in-house consumer bank, as well as the partial sale of its asset management business. \nShareholders said another loss would add pressure on Cryan, who was appointed in 2015 to steer the bank\u2019s return to profit. \n\u201cIf the bank performs too poorly compared with its competitors, then one would need to start another debate about the strategy,\u201d Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment, was quoted as saying by Handelsblatt newspaper. \nSpeich, whose fund holds Deutsche stock, said management had about two quarters to show they were delivering an improvement. \nThe company has struggled to keep revenue from shrinking and experienced a 10 percent drop in the third quarter. The bank had warned that the fourth quarter could be rough and confirmed that view on Friday. \n\u201cTrading conditions in the fourth quarter 2017 were characterised by low volatility in financial markets and low levels of client activity in key businesses,\u201d Deutsche Bank said in its statement. \nRevenue at Deutsche\u2019s cash-generating bond-trading division was expected to drop 22 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago, the bank said. \nThe bank is due to report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Feb. 2. It posted a net loss of 1.4 billion euros in 2016 and 6.8 billion euros in 2015. \nThe company has been recovering from multiple legal battles, ranging from its role in the marketing of U.S. mortgage-backed securities to a so-called mirror trading scheme that could be used for money laundering. \nLast year, a looming $14 billion fine from the U.S. Department of Justice had unsettled clients and investors and prompted talk of a government bailout. \nThe bank said the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent would translate into an average tax rate for the whole group at the lower end of a range between 30 percent and 35 percent. \nThe lower effective tax rate would require a revision to the valuation of deferred tax assets, causing the negative hit to Deutsche\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings, it said, adding that it would not have any cash impact. \n($1 = 0.8306 euros) Reporting by Tom Sims; Additional reporting by Andrea Lentz and Andreas Cremer; Editing by David Goodman and Edmund Blair"}

The chance of a rate hike on Jan. 17 jumped to 86 percent after the report while the two-year yield pushed to its highest since June 2011 at 1.795 percent. Expectations for a hike hit nearly 80 percent on Friday after data showed the economy added almost 80,000 jobs in December\nPressure on production capacity continued, with the share of firms reporting they would have some or significant difficulty meeting an unanticipated increase in demand hitting its highest level since the 2008-2009 recession, the bank said.\nStill, the survey noted increasing concern about the renegotiation of NAFTA, which U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to terminate. Negotiations are ongoing.\n\u201cWhile respondents are increasingly concerned about the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and rising protectionism more generally, most see healthy U.S. growth and the low Canadian dollar benefiting their sales over the next 12 months,\u201d the bank said.\nInflation expectations were modest and unchanged from the third quarter, the survey showed, suggesting corporate Canada has not been able to raise prices despite economic strength.\n\u201cOne notable feature in the survey is that despite the capacity constraints and growing labor shortages, inflation expectations are still quite muted,\u201d said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.\nBank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has said the bank needs to tighten monetary policy gradually before inflation bubbles up, rather than slam on the brakes when it appears.\nFirms said competitive pressures dampen their ability to raise output prices despite the acceleration in input prices, the survey showed.

Then Foles and his offence tore up the league's stingiest scoring defence, with long TD throws to Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith. LeGarrette Blount had an 11-yard scoring run when things were decided in the first half, and the Eagles were headed to an NFL title game the Vikings (14-4) hoped to be in at their own stadium.\n\"You know everyone was against us,\" Foles said. \"Coming out here and stick together and (we) come away with an amazing victory against a great team.\"\nBlake Bortles and the stingy Jaguars (12-7) led New England 20-10 early in the fourth quarter, but couldn't hold against the defending champions.\nThe NFL's second-ranked defence kept Brady and the Patriots at bay for most of the game, but lost linebacker Myles Jack and defensive tackle Marcell Dareus on consecutive plays on New England's winning drive.\nIt was New England's 13th win in 14 games since their 2-2 start. Their only stumble since September was a 27-20 loss at the Dolphins on Dec. 11.\nBrady, wearing a black bandage on his right hand after needing stitches to close a cut that happened on a play during practice earlier in the week, showed no signs of being hampered.\nAnd, with the game \u2014 and the season \u2014 possibly on the line, the Patriots star came up big again.\n\"I've had a lot worse,\" Brady said. \"I didn't know that on Wednesday. It was a crazy injury. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday was a little scary. Then I started getting some confidence and today we did just enough to win.\"\nBrady finished 26 of 38 for 290 yards and two touchdowns to Amendola.\nIt's the eighth Super Bowl appearance for Brady and coach Bill Belichick, who have won five times \u2014 including last year's 34-28 overtime rally against the Falcons.\n\"It's pretty amazing,\" Brady said. \"Just to be on a team that wins these kinds of games, it's just a great accomplishment.\""}

Unless extended, a series of mandatory furloughs and service cuts would kick in.\nAny shutdown, even for a few days, would be costly. Congressional fiscal gridlock resulted in a 16-day stalemate in October 2013 that cost the economy more than $1 billion a day, according to most estimates.\nIf lawmakers miss the Jan. 19 deadline, some benefits, like unemployment insurance and veterans' benefits, could be delayed or reduced. Among the headaches: national parks, museums and many passport offices would shut down; the Small Business Administration and FHA would stop guaranteeing new loan applications; farm subsidy checks would stop flowing; and IRS tax processing would slow down.\nKeeping the government spending at existing levels, or raising spending, could trigger automatic spending cuts as part of a system, known as the sequester, that was put in place in 2011 to hold the line on spending. To head off automatic cuts across the board, Congress will have to raise those spending caps.\nBut lawmakers have been deadlocked along party lines over how to raise the caps. Republicans want to boost military spending by $650 billion through the end of this fiscal year. Democrats insist that any increase in military spending must be matched dollar-for-dollar with higher domestic spending.\nEven if they can agree on a spending plan, lawmakers face another fiscal deadline of March to increase the debt ceiling. That's when the Treasury Department is expected to run out of cash to pay the government's bills without borrowing more money.\nHEALTH INSURANCE \nSome 9 million children will be left without health insurance unless Congress votes to renew funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Last year, Congress blew past a Sept. 30 deadline to reauthorize funding for the federally funded, state-administered program.\nBefore leaving for the holidays, lawmakers added $3 billion in funding to the federal program to keep it from running out of money. Without those funds, about a third of the states would have begun suspending coverage this month, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nWhile the temporary fix buys the program a little more time, some states have already started notifying families that they may soon lose coverage.\nAlso unresolved is an effort to help contain health insurance premium costs under the Affordable Care Act. As part of her approval for the tax reform package, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine won a promise from GOP leadership to support a measure to restore federal payment to insurers. The Trump administration ended those subsidies last year.\nDACA \nIn September, Trump ended the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program with a six-month delay to force congressional action. The program, known as DACA, protects from deportation nearly 800,000 young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and permits them to work.\nThe expiration deadline is not until March 5, but the program could become a sticking point in government funding talks this month if Democrats decide to use it as leverage.\nBipartisan congressional leaders plan to meet with White House officials on Wednesday about government funding and DACA.\nTrump has thrown more uncertainty into the delicate talks with tweets in recent days. On Tuesday, he claimed that Democrats \"are doing nothing\" to protect the young immigrants . Last week, he said he would not accept a DACA deal without funding for his proposed border wall .\nDemocrats have repeatedly pushed back against efforts to secure funding for a physical barrier between the U.S. and Mexico.\nDISASTER FUNDING \nCongress has pushed to pass tens of billions of dollars more in disaster aid funding for a series of devastating natural disasters last year. Hurricanes ravaged Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida, while wildfires damaged California.\nIn December, the House passed an $81 billion relief bill. The Senate did not take up the legislation, as some lawmakers said it did not include enough money for a battered Puerto Rico.\nIn November, the White House requested less money \u2014 $44 billion \u2014 than was included in the House legislation.\nWATCH: Lawmakers are gearing up for a budget fight show chapters US lawmakers are gearing up for a budget fight      5 Hours Ago | 00:49"}

The composite new orders index climbed to 58.0 last month \u2014 its highest since July 2007 \u2014 from 57.3. That demand pushed companies to add staff; hiring growth matched a 17-year record high set in November.\nEuro zone unemployment peaked at 12.1 percent in the first half of 2013. It has now declined to 8.8 percent.\nThe services PMI, which is part of the composite, soared to its highest in more than six years, 56.6, up from 56.2 in November. That followed a report on Tuesday showing the manufacturing PMI climbed to its highest in more than two decades of survey data .\nBut price pressure eased, a disappointing development for the ECB, which has been struggling to boost inflation. The rate of increases in input costs and what business charge consumers slowed for the first time in five months. Still, inflationary pressures remain at levels not seen in over six years.\n\"Based on past experience, the extent to which demand appears to be outstripping supply for many goods and services suggests that inflationary pressures could continue to build in the coming months,\" noted Williamson.\n\"A big question for 2018 will therefore be whether relatively high unemployment and spare capacity in many countries will continue to hold down pay growth and keep a ceiling on consumer price inflation.\""}

The federal government has requirements for human-driven vehicles, that don\u2019t necessarily correspond with a vehicle driven by AI. For instance, human-driven vehicles require an airbag in a steering wheel. But if there isn\u2019t a steering wheel in the vehicle than that requirement would be impossible to meet.

But it could sting exporters and farmers longer term since the United States is Canada's biggest wheat, hog and cattle export market. \nThe country's energy industry does not expect tariffs to be imposed on oil and gas exports, said Nick Schultz of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, given that would amount to an additional cost to U.S. refiners, which import 3 million barrels a day of Canadian crude.

For a fiscal conservative, I don't see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people's money,\" he said.\nMeadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party's debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt.\n\"It's interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,\" Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS.\nCrowley said the Republican tax bill would require the United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich.\n\"This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we've ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we're going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,\" Crowley said.\nRepublicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years, will boost the economy and job growth.\n'ENTITLEMENT REFORM'\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or \"entitlement reform,\" as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018.\nIn Republican parlance, \"entitlement\" programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy.\nDemocrats seized on Ryan's early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs.\nBut the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown.\nDemocrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the \"Dreamers,\" people brought illegally to the country as children.\nTrump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits.\nThe president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers.\nRepresentative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. \"We need to do DACA clean,\" she said.\nOn Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said.\nTrump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.\n(Reporting by Kevin Drawbaugh; Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton in Florida; Editing by Peter Cooney)"}

Someone who can teach me new things and inspire me,\u201d El-Hassan wrote on her dating profile. \nShe sent messages to him on the WhatsApp messaging service with links to websites with details on making ricin. He sent back her graphic videos of IS beheadings, shootings and killing prisoners using explosives. \nWhen police arrested him in Dec. 2016, Mohammed, who worked in a food factory making meals for supermarkets, possessed instruction manuals on mobile phone detonators, ricin and how to make explosives, prosecutors said. \nHe had also contacted an IS commander via Facebook and offered to carry out a \u201clone actor\u201d mission. \nMohammed, who the BBC reported was Eritrean-born and had come to Britain from Sudan as an asylum seeker, and El-Hassan were both found guilty of preparing for act of terrorism at London\u2019s Old Bailey court and will be sentenced next month.

It struck a coalition deal with the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO), making Austria the only western European country with a far-right party in government. \nThe FPO controls the interior, foreign, defense and social affairs ministries, among others. \nAt the start of a two-day cabinet meeting in a castle near Slovenia, Kurz said the government would cut benefits for Austrian residents\u2019 children who live in a country where the cost of living is lower. \n\u201cIt is an unfairness built into the system that, for two children who do not even live in Austria but in Romania, roughly 300 euros a month are transferred to Romania and that is almost the average income there,\u201d Kurz told reporters standing alongside Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache. \nPayments vary depending on children\u2019s age and number but start around 114 euros ($138) a month for an only child. \n\u201cWe will reach a decision in cabinet here so that child benefit payments are not made abroad to the same extent as before,\u201d Kurz said, adding that adjusting payments to the local cost of living would save \u201cmore than 100 million euros (a year)\u201d. A general view of a two-day cabinet meeting in Seggau, Austria, January 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Heinz-Peter Bader \nThat pales in comparison with the 2.5 billion euros in savings the government aims to make this year. Kurz said the move was being made so quickly because it was one of the easiest to prepare. \nThe plan is part of a broader government agenda that includes cutting taxes, reducing benefits for refugees and restricting new immigrants\u2019 access to many social services for five years. \nAustria borders eight countries, including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia, where wages are significantly lower. Eastern Europeans make up a large part of its workforce in sectors including healthcare and construction. Slideshow (6 Images) \nIn 2016 Austria transferred 273 million euros abroad to EU and European Economic Area countries in benefit payments for 132,000 children. \nThe European Commission criticized Germany last year for a similar plan to cut child benefits, which was later abandoned. It gave a guarded reaction on Thursday. \n\u201cWe take note and we will examine the laws with regard to their compatibility with EU law if and once adopted,\u201d a Commission spokeswoman said. \nKurz said a legal paper commissioned by the government \u201cclearly shows that it is legally possible to take these measures\u201d, adding: \u201cWe have prepared this well.\u201d \n($1 = 0.8289 euros) Reporting by Francois Murphy; Additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla in Vienna and Robert-Jan Bartunek in Brussels Editing by Jeremy Gaunt"}

Digital currency proponents say the greater potential lies in the blockchain technology behind bitcoin. Blockchain creates a rapid, permanent and open record of transactions between two parties, thereby eliminating the need for a central party, such as a bank. \nBitcoin became the first application of blockchain technology nearly a decade ago, and in the last several years developers have used the technology to create other digital coin systems.

Other applications of blockchain technology create tokens that can be used to access the network's services, such as cloud storage or trading. \nAll these applications can create the next generation of the internet, or a \"world computer,\" the value of which could rise into the trillions of dollars, Steves said in the report. \nHowever, the growth of cryptocurrencies comes with very high risks. \nSteves pointed out in his report that many storage systems for bitcoin are hackable, and governments have no incentive to catch thieves of a currency not recognized as legal tender.

A record-setting blast of cold is expected to follow the system.\nSouthwest Airlines warned travelers that flights to and from 19 East Coast airports may be canceled, delayed or diverted due to the storm and encouraged travelers to change their travel dates.\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said Wednesday it had 524 pieces of snow equipment at the area's airports that can melt up to 500 tons of snow an hour but that flights may still be canceled due to high winds and poor visibility.\nAirlines frequently offer travelers a chance to change their travel dates far in advance of a storm in an effort to avoid chaos at the airport, where travelers may be stranded, and to prevent a crush of frustrated travelers from overloading their employees.\nInternational flights are a priority Long-haul international flights are often among the last flights airlines cancel, because they generate much more revenue than short, domestic flights and are serviced by much larger aircraft.\nThe cancellation of an international flight can cause logistical problems to snowball into disruptions lasting more than a day because both aircraft and crews are out of position. U.S. airlines have much greater access to aircraft and crews within the country.\nEven though JFK had suspended operations midmorning, only 253 flights, about 40 percent of its scheduled departures, were canceled out of the major international hub. Many international flights, particularly lucrative trans-Atlantic routes, depart in the evening, so some airlines appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach. \nWhile flights might not be canceled due to weather, transit disruptions could force airlines to call off flights because flight attendants and pilots may not be able to reach their assigned planes. \nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the largest airports in the New York area, said late Thursday morning that the AirTrain, which connects the subway with the airport's terminals, has been suspended.\nIt was unclear how much the storm will cost airlines. Last year, a string of strong hurricanes that hit airlines' hubs cost airlines hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue, but clearing runways from a snowstorm is a much faster process than recovering from the floods, power outages, structural damage to airports and other infrastructure damage that 2017's storms caused."}

The Monero cryptocurrency logo is seen in this illustration photo January 8, 2018. REUTERS\/Thomas White\/Illustration \nThe application, which was created on Dec. 24, uses host computers to mine a cryptocurrency called Monero. It then sends any coins to Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang, said cybersecurity firm AlienVault, which examined the program. \n\u201cCrypto-currencies may provide a financial lifeline to a country hit hard by sanctions, and as a result universities in Pyongyang have shown a clear interest in cryptocurrencies,\u201d the California-based security firm said in a release, adding that the software \u201cmay be the most recent product of their endeavours.\u201d \nThe company added a caveat that a North Korean server used in the code does not appear to be connected to the wider internet, which could mean its inclusion is meant to trick observers into making a North Korean connection. Kim Il Sung University, however, plays host to foreign students and lecturers, not just North Koreans. \nKim Il Sung University did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Government officials representing North Korea at the United Nations were not immediately available for comment. \nOthers have flagged increasing signs of North Korean interest in cryptocurrencies and underlying blockchain technology. \n\u201cWith economic sanctions in place, cryptocurrencies are currently the best way to earn foreign currency in North Korea\u2019s situation. It is hard to trace and can be laundered several times,\u201d said Mun Chong-hyun, chief analyst at South Korean cybersecurity firm ESTsecurity. \nCryptocurrency watchers say technical details of Monero, the 13th-largest crypto asset in the world, according to www.coinmarketcap.com, with a total value of more than $7 billion, make it more appealing than bitcoin to those who value secrecy. \nMonero funds go to an unlinkable, one-time address generated with random numbers every time a payment is issued. That makes it less traceable than bitcoin, where transactions can be linked to specific, albeit anonymous, private addresses, cybersecurity experts said. \nSouth Korea-based Bithumb, the world\u2019s busiest cryptocurrency exchange, is also the largest Monero trading exchange in the world, with about 24 percent of trading volume. The next largest were Europe-based exchange HitBTC and Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, as of Monday. \nCybersecurity firm FireEye cited in a November blog post a series of North Korean activities against South Korean cryptocurrency targets such as exchanges. Analyst Luke McNamara wrote that \u201cit should be no surprise that cryptocurrencies, as an emerging asset class, are becoming a target of interest by a regime that operates in many ways like a criminal enterprise.\u201d \nIn early November, Federico Tenga, the Italian co-founder of bitcoin startup Chainside, posted on his Twitter account pictures and comments on his visit to lecture on bitcoin and blockchain technology at the Western-funded Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. \n\u201cThe lectures were at a quite basic level to give a general understanding of blockchain technologies, which are also very relevant to trade, supply chains and other e-business,\u201d a spokesman for the university said. \n\u201cWe believe this teaching can give the next generation of North Korean professionals additional concepts that may be valuable as they seek to develop their country,\u201d the spokesman added. \u201cWe\u2019re acutely aware of issues around sanctions, which we keep under regular review and take care to avoid any sensitive or proscribed areas.\u201d \nTenga said his lectures were geared toward explaining the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies. \n\u201cThe focus of the lectures was to make the students understand what the blockchain is, how it works (special focus on proof of work) and what are the main use cases. My aim was simply to spread technical knowledge, not suggesting them how to use it,\u201d Tenga told Reuters in a series of messages. \nAlienVault\u2019s report said one North Korean IP address, 175.45.178.19, has been active on bitcoin trading sites. That is the same address used to control compromised web servers in 2014-15 cyberattacks on South Korean energy, traffic, telecommunications, broadcasting, financial and political institutions, according to security firm AhnLab . \nThe report also observed that North Korean IP addresses have downloaded several episodes of the automotive TV series Top Gear and documentaries by the show\u2019s former presenter James May.

REUTERS\/Carlos Barria\/File Photo And yet the plan, announced in September, set off sharp criticism from other sectors that Trump has also vowed to help, such as natural gas and utilities.\n\u201cSubsidies don\u2019t make you competitive - and don\u2019t make you great again,\u201d said Robert Flexon, the president and chief executive of Dynegy Inc, a Houston-based utility that owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants.\nSquabbling over the proposal exemplifies the administration\u2019s larger struggle to deliver on promises of a sweeping \u201cenergy renaissance\u201d across the coal, oil, gas and nuclear industries.\nTrouble is, policies that help one of those sectors often hurt another, illustrating the complexity of energy regulation and the difficulty in appeasing competing interests. While election campaigns often seek to neatly divide voters into two camps - those supporting energy vs. those supporting the environment - such rhetoric fails to capture the messier policy impacts on profits, hiring and emissions reductions across the energy landscape.\nThere is little evidence that Trump\u2019s moves so far have aided energy firms of any stripe; some administration proposals have languished amid divisive politics, while other regulatory changes have seen their impact muted by market forces.\nUtilities, for instance, have shown little interest in buying more coal-fired power despite the regulatory rollbacks in Trump\u2019s pro-coal push.\nA broader measure of investor sentiment on the energy industry - the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 energy index - lost more than 7 percent in 2017 even as stock markets soared.\nWhite House and Energy Department officials did not respond to requests for comment.\nAnother political flashpoint has been the administration\u2019s waffling over proposed changes to biofuels policy.\nTrump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency initially entertained a plan from oil refiners to upend regulations requiring them to blend ethanol into their gasoline - then rejected it after a backlash from the ethanol industry, rooted in Midwest corn-growing states that supported Trump\u2019s election.\nThe dispute sparked open warfare among the congressional backers of various industry interests, including threats to block Trump\u2019s agency nominations and accusations he had welched on campaign promises.\nEven the coal industry, which played a starring role in Trump\u2019s campaign, has seen a marginal return on its lobbying efforts. It has, for instance, had little success so far in attacking subsidies for wind and solar power.\nTrump and others in his administration have criticized renewable energy as expensive and dependent on government support. But the White House has not sought to repeal tax breaks expected to provide $12.3 billion to renewable energy firms by 2020, which other Republicans continue to support.\nFossil-fuel firms clearly have more influence on policy under Trump and easier access to decision makers. Coal, oil, and gas company executives have met regularly with senior administration officials, according to official agency schedules.\nTheir policy victories include rollbacks of regulations limiting emissions of carbon, methane and other pollutants; the opening of Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling; and the lifting of a coal-mining moratorium on federal lands.\nBut the impact of these moves on production, profits and jobs remains uncertain. Demand for additional drilling and mining leases on federal lands has been thin, and top U.S. oil and gas companies have told shareholders in regulatory filings that environmental regulations have little impact on their business.\nWhile coal advocates have generally cheered Trump\u2019s ascension, White House policies have so far had little effect on U.S. coal consumption.\nRobert Murray, chief executive of private coal company Murray Energy Corp., said Republican efforts to boost coal have addressed only the \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d of overturning a few environmental regulations while avoiding tougher issues.\nThe oil and gas industry, also championed by Trump, similarly feels let down by an administration it had hoped would strip away government interference, said Susan Ginsburg, a senior vice president of regulatory affairs for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents small oil and gas companies.\nFILE PHOTO: People show their support as Donald Trump speaks in Charleston, West Virginia, U.S., May 5, 2016. REUTERS\/Chris Tilley\/File Photo The industry, she said, expected that \u201cmarkets would be allowed to work.\u201d\nHELP FOR COAL HURTS NATURAL GAS For the coal industry - which has seen a decade of decline amid competition from cheap natural gas - the wish-list for the Trump administration is long.\nIn the months after Trump was elected, Trump and senior cabinet members including Energy Secretary Rick Perry met with mining executives such as Murray. Other administration officials met with lobbyists for coal firms including Peabody Energy Corp, the nation\u2019s largest miner.\nMurray handed the White House a long list of recommendations, including rescinding pollution controls, slashing the EPA\u2019s size and ending green energy incentives.\nEmails obtained by the Sierra Club in October revealed that Peabody had also given the administration a list of proposals, including a controversial electricity pricing measure based on the argument that coal and nuclear plants improve grid reliability.\nPerry proposed in September that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reward coal and nuclear plants that have 90 days of fuel supply in reserve by covering their operating costs through power pricing changes. FERC is expected to decide on the request by Jan. 10.\nSlideshow (2 Images) That proposal irritated oil and gas producers, along with renewable energy firms. Both were caught off guard, said a Washington-based oil-and-gas lobbyist who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern over offending the administration.\n\u201cNobody in the oil and gas industry, or in the renewables industry for that matter, was consulted,\u201c the lobbyist said. \u201dIt just came out of nowhere.\u201d\nThe American Petroleum Institute, which represents major U.S. oil and gas companies, wrote that the plan \u201cupsets the very foundations of the competitive wholesale electricity markets.\u201d\nMichael Steel, a spokesman for the Affordable Energy Coalition, which has oil major BP as a member, called the proposal an unfair subsidy.\n\u201cThe Department of Energy is trying to pick winners and losers in a way that will raise costs for consumers by billions of dollars,\u201d Steel said.\n\u2018BROKEN PROGRAM\u2019\nThe political dustup over biofuels policy provides another telling example of the difficulty appeasing competing industry camps.\nThe Renewable Fuel Standard was introduced under former President Geor"}

Any report that suggests that the products are not safe is totally false.\" \nA report in December from WJAR-TV in Rhode Island cited Kristi Warner, who mailed her daughter's glitter makeup kit to a lab, which said it contained tremolite asbestos, a toxic, cancer-causing material. \nWarner works at the Deaton Law Firm, which focuses primarily on mass tort asbestos litigation. Warner sent the products to be tested, because her background made her aware of the potential danger of the makeup, which was a gift to her daughter, she told CNBC at the time. \nSean Fitzgerald, director of research and legal services at the Scientific Analytical Institute, which conducted those tests, frequently testifies on behalf of plaintiffs in asbestos tort litigation. He did the initial tests for free for Warner, he told CNBC. When the lab tested more products to see if asbestos results proved to be widespread, the Deaton Law Firm footed the bill, he said. \nFitzgerald told CNBC on Thursday that he stands by the results. He said some companies can use testing methods that, although approved, are not up to today's testing standards. \nTesting methods are not always black and white. Last year, Fitzgerald's testimony in an asbestos suit against Colgate-Palmolive was excluded, because the judge deemed that Fitzgerald \"[modified] and\/or var[ied] from accepted methodologies,\" according to legal news website Law360. \nFitzgerald addressed the issue in the Colgate-Palmolive suit by saying his testing methods have been accepted in other courts, and each judge views testing methods differently. \nClaire's also said in its statement that it has made multiple request for detailed test data, but it has not been provided. \nFitzgerald said the detailed data is with his client, the Deaton Law Firm. Warner said that a document has been sent over to Claire's outlining testing methods. She also said the firm was still in possession of the items that had produced the asbestos positive results, so Claire's has not tested those specific products for asbestos. \nA source familiar with the situation said Claire's believes the documents sent to its lawyers were insufficient. \nJohn Deaton, who founded the East Providence, Rhode Island, law firm, could not be immediately reached for comment on Thursday."}

The GOP has framed passing funding legislation as crucial to supporting American military and national security efforts. \n\"For people to hold up money for our military for these unrelated issues \u2014 and for deadlines that don't even exist this Friday \u2014 that makes no sense,\" Ryan told reporters. \nRepublicans have control of the House, Senate and White House and can pass a spending bill on their own. Some Republicans, however, have criticized the notion of passing another short-term funding plan. Congress in late December last approved a stopgap bill through Friday. \nHouse Republicans hope to pass another temporary measure this week to extend government funding through Feb. 16. It would reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program for six years and delay some Affordable Care Act taxes .\nThe GOP does not plan to approve legislation this week to shield hundreds of thousands of young immigrants who were protected by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which President Donald Trump ended in September. The immigrants could start to face deportation after March 5. \nOn Wednesday morning, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the funding measure a \"loser.\" He added that Democrats \"will do everything we can\" to avoid a shutdown. \n\"If, God forbid, there's a shutdown, it will fall on the majority leader's shoulders and the president's shoulders,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \nSchumer decried Trump's rejection of an immigration deal bipartisan senators brought to him Thursday. It would have protected the immigrants shielded by DACA and made concessions to Republicans, including increasing funding for some border security measures and making changes to extended family migration. \nEarlier last week, Trump signaled to bipartisan lawmakers that he would sign whatever they passed. \nIn remarks Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said bipartisan talks on immigration continued, but added that he did not believe the issue needed to be resolved this week. \n\"There's no cause whatsoever for manufacturing a crisis and holding up funding for the vital services of the federal government,\" McConnell said."}

Put down your phones, turn off the television and get some shut eye. \nIn a media-saturated world where most people are always plugged in, that advice may seem easier said than done. There's little doubt that, for those reasons, people are losing out on sleep: Experts recommend at least seven hours per night for adults aged 18 to 60 years old. \nStudies show that sleeping less than 7 hours increases the risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes, stroke, depression and heart disease to name a few. Yet, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 35 percent of adults are not getting enough sleep . \nIt's something that Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington knows all too well. Ten years ago, the media mogul says she collapsed due to exhaustion, and broke her cheek bone in the process. Huffington referred to it as her \"wake up call\" and knew she needed to make changes in her life. \nHuffington felt so strongly about the issue that she launched a new company called Thrive Global that focuses on reducing stress and improving wellness. \n\"I wanted to create a company that could both work with corporations to change their culture and help them see the connection between well-being and business metrics, and also have a media platform where we could have all the latest science and new role models,\" Huffington told CNBC's \"On the Money\" in an interview. \nFor example, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos recently wrote a piece for Thrive on why he sleeps 8 hours per night. \n\"People did not expect a major executive to actually be getting the sleep he needed to make the best decisions,\" Huffington explained. \nIf you're one of the estimated 83 million Americans that isn't getting the proper res t, Huffington recommended tips to help you achieve better sleep, including: Keep your phone out of your bedroom at night; Take a minute in the morning to remember what you're grateful for, and; Set your intention for the day before looking at your phone \n\"If you think about it, your phone is everybody else's agenda for you,\" said Huffington. \"Ending your day without your phone and starting your day without your phone are keys.\" \"... If somebody is taking care of themselves it means they are not going to burn out\" -Arianna Huffington, Thrive founder \nThrive Global even sells a phone bed charging station , so that when you go to bed, so do your devices. \nIn addition to products like the phone bed, Thrive offers what may seem like a counterintuitive solution, a mobile app that's currently available to Android users, with an iOS version in the works. Jodi Luchs \nThe idea behind the app is to help users set up boundaries when it comes to using their phone. Turning on \"Thrive Mode\" blocks calls, texts, and allows users to set up an auto reply. \nSo what would happen if Huffington emails an employee about work and gets a \"Thrive mode\" reply message? \n\"I actually love that,\" Huffington told CNBC. \"We all have to learn to work in teams. And if somebody is taking care of themselves it means they are not going to burn out. And we know that burnt out employees are over 30 percent more likely to change jobs.\" \nWhen it comes to social media, Huffington says we're at a major inflection point. \n\"It's about ten years since the smartphone has become so ubiquitous and such a big part of our lives, so now we're establishing the rules of the road,\" she said. Yet Huffington added that the responsibility to regulate social media usage isn't just on individuals, but companies as well. \n\"Companies are beginning to realize the backlash - and to take steps to basically produce products that are not so addictive,\" Huffington explained. \"Otherwise they are going to be regulated.\" PhotoAlto\/Frederic Cirou\/Getty Images \nOn the Money airs on CNBC Saturdays at 5:30 am ET, or check listings for air times in local markets."}

As the industry gathers in Detroit for its annual confab, carmakers are revving up their plans for the next generation of vehicles. Ford on Sunday said it\u2019s more than doubling its electric battery investment to more than $11 billion by 2022. A day earlier, General Motors revealed it had asked regulators to approve its driverless car. Toyota, Volkswagen and others are tanking up, too. Investors, though, aren\u2019t buying it.\nMost of the world\u2019s major carmakers trade in a narrow range between 7 and 9 times this year\u2019s expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. That suggests the industry is not only failing to grow, but in decline. Only Toyota and Honda are worth more than the 10 times net income that implies an expanding business, based on their estimated calendar-year results.\nIn a usual cycle, such skepticism would be expected. Vehicle sales in North America are retreating from record highs and European growth remains sluggish. Meanwhile, interest rates are rising, albeit slowly, making car loans more expensive.\nThis time round, though, the industry is grappling with what are likely to be fundamental changes to the business model. The wealth of data captured from connecting vehicles to the internet could represent more $120 billion-a-year revenue opportunity, reckon UBS analysts \u2013 think everything from improved diagnostics to traffic info to infotainment and shopping.\nAnd autonomous cars may alter how we own and use transportation \u2013 and how vehicle manufacturers make money. GM reckons it could bring in 10 times or more the average $31,000 in revenue it currently earns over the lifetime of a vehicle from owning and operating its own fleets of self-driving taxis and ride-sharing vehicles. It\u2019s hoping to roll out its first commercial fleet of self-driving taxis in cities next year.\nThere are admittedly questions about how fast such new technologies will be accepted and adopted. Sourcing raw materials for electric batteries is an issue, too. Miner Glencore reckons cobalt supplies will have to triple by 2030 to meet automakers\u2019 planned demands.\nNone of these concerns weighs on Tesla. It trades at 230 times unadjusted 2020 earnings, the first year it\u2019s expected to turn a profit, despite missing several production targets as Chief Executive Elon Musk tries to turn it into a mass producer.\nMusk, of course, has a cult following. If shareholders in his longer-lived rivals had the same belief in them, carmaker valuations would soar.\n "}

Analysts at Brazilian bank BTG Pactual said the market had expected a settlement of $5 billion to $10 billion. \nPetrobras preferred shares ticked up nearly 1 percent to 16.71 reais. U.S.-traded shares were up 1.78 percent at $10.89. \nMoody's brushed off concerns about the impact of the fine on the company's balance sheet, noting it was expected to generate some $30 billion in cash this year and make capital investments of around $15 billion. \n\"Petrobras' liquidity position is adequate and the payment of the agreed class action settlement amount is not a material concern,\" it said. \nJeremy Lieberman, an attorney for the investors, called the deal an \"excellent result\" and said it was the largest ever involving a foreign securities issuer in the country. \nThe deal came as the U.S. Supreme Court was set to consider on Jan. 5 whether to hear Petrobras' appeal of a lower court decision certifying the case as a class action. Petrobras said it and the investors would ask the Supreme Court to put off considering the case while the settlement awaits approval. \nIf the Supreme Court does take the case, it could delay its resolution for years. \nU.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan must still approve the accord. \nInvestors had sued Petrobras after prosecutors in Brazil accused executives of accepting more than $2 billion in bribes over a decade, mainly from construction and engineering companies. \nPetrobras claimed it was a victim, and denied wrongdoing in a securities filing on Wednesday. But its market value has plunged as its central role in the scheme continues to be unwound by investigators. \nPetrobras said it hoped the settlement would resolve all investor claims in the United States, though some claims involving non-U.S.-based Petrobras securities purchased outside the United States still remain. \nThe deal came days after Brazil's securities regulator CVM formally accused eight former Petrobras executives of corruption. \nThe accusations relate to possible irregularities in the contracting process for three drilling ships, according to a legal filing by the regulator last Friday. \nAmong the accused in CVM's filing are former Petrobras Chief Executives Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli. Neither could be reached for comment. \nThe largest securities fraud settlements in U.S. history include $7.2 billion stemming from the collapse of Enron, $6.2 billion over an accounting scandal at WorldCom and $3.2 billion over an accounting scandal at Tyco International, according to Stanford Law School's Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.

They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!\u201d \nAs many as a dozen people may have died in the protests, according to state TV and local reports. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, seeking to calm the unrest, on Sunday defended the Iranian people\u2019s right to protest while urging them to work with his administration to address what he said were justified grievances about the economy. \nThose comments came after Rouhani\u2019s government restricted access to social media, which has become an important source of information about the protests. \nThe rare public show of dissent comes at a time when prices and joblessness are on the rise and Trump\u2019s administration has placed additional sanctions on the country. Trump said on Twitter a day before that the U.S. will be watching \u201cvery closely\u201d for human rights violations during the protests. \nIn another Twitter posting on New Year\u2019s Day, Trump called out Pakistan and said his administration was seeking to get tougher with that nation. In October he said leaders there were beginning to respect the U.S. again and pointed to the release of a U.S. woman and her Canadian born husband as proof the country is working with the U.S. \nPakistan is a partner with the U.S. in the fight against terrorism, yet it was was also the hiding place where 9\/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden lived for years before being killed in a nighttime raid by Navy Seals. \n\u201cThe United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!\u201d Trump tweeted.

The federal government sent troops to Rio de Janeiro and other areas last year to quell violence generally related to the drug trade. \nThe report calls for international bodies such as the United Nations and the Mercosur trade bloc to offer more support to stop illegal arms trafficking, as well as for more bilateral agreements such as a 2006 deal between Brazil and Paraguay to cooperate in combating the arms trade. \nEight foreign stores are named selling the most high caliber guns that ended up in Brazil, with five located in Florida, although a store in Paraguay was the largest individual seller. \nGuns from the United States generally enter Brazil through direct shipments of assembled weapons, shipments of gun parts or indirect shipments through a third country, with Paraguay being the top intermediary. \nOutside the military, Brazilians can legally own guns only if they meet a series of stiff checks and even then can buy only small caliber weapons. In these instances, guns are allowed for rural residents who need them for daily subsistence, hunters and those who can prove they need a gun for self-defense. \nWhile laws on gun purchases in the United States vary from state to state and also depend on the type of weapon being sold, it can be a fairly simple process to buy a gun, or to acquire one that was legally sold to another person. \nWhile the overwhelming majority of guns entered over land, the report detailed an instance of 22 assault rifles sent to Brazil in a shipment of furniture, having been sewn into mattresses, with most ending up in Sao Paulo and Rio. \nIn another incident, 60 assault rifles that originated in Miami were discovered inside pool heaters in a cargo shipment at a Rio airport. \nThe entry of high caliber arms into the country is associated with gangs carrying out robberies of banks, ATMs and armored cars as the criminals want to guarantee they will have superior fire power in a confrontation with the police or armed guards, according to the report.

They have to be fit and have good stamina, and at the same time be able to focus, to shift from the energetic skiing to being a calm shot,\u201d explained Chabloz, who now coaches young biathletes in Sweden. \nEach miss is penalised by either by straight time penalty or the athlete being forced to ski in a \u201cpenalty loop\u201d that is usually 150 meters long. \nThis means that a considerable lead built up while skiing can be quickly wiped out if the shooter fails to hit the target. \nFor Chabloz, it is the simplicity of the sport that makes it so appealing to athletes and audiences alike. \n\u201cIt\u2019s about skiing fast and shooting straight,\u201d he said.

(NYSE: FC), a global performance improvement company that creates and distributes world-class content, training, processes, and tools that organizations and individuals use to transform their results, today announced financial results for its fiscal 2018 first quarter, which ended on November 30, 2017.\nIntroduction\nWith the fiscal 2016 launch of the All Access Pass (AAP), the Company began a major transition in its business model. Previously, the Company sold content and solutions one course, or one solution at a time, and often to only one team at a time. However, two years ago the Company determined the it could substantially expand the breadth and depth of its client impact, and the lifetime value of its clients, by offering its world-class content and offerings through a Subscription as a Service (SaaS) model featuring the All Access Pass in its Enterprise Division and The Leader in Me subscription service in its Education Division. The SaaS model provides the Company\u2019s clients with a compelling value proposition in which they receive: (1) unlimited access to the Company\u2019s content and solutions; (2) the ability to assemble, integrate and deliver this content through an almost limitless combination of delivery modalities, and soon in 16 languages worldwide; (3) the services of an implementation specialist to help curate and organize the content and solutions in the AAP to exactly meet their needs; (4) a cost per population trained which is less than or equal to that offered by other providers for just a single course through a single delivery modality; and (5) an array of affordable add-on implementation services to help them accomplish their key \u201cjobs-to-be-done.\u201d\nAs expected, the transition to the SaaS business model has been disruptive, especially to the Company\u2019s reported financial results, since subscription revenues are generally deferred and recognized over the contract period. But the Company believes that the transition to a SaaS business model is working and some of the benefits of this business model became evident in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as sales increased 20% over the prior year to $47.9 million. Increased sales and improved gross margin were partially offset by increased operating expenses as the Company continues to work through the transition to a SaaS model and seeks to reorganize and optimize its operations in order to improve profitability. The Company believes that the first quarter of fiscal 2018 represents a key inflection point that will begin a pattern of improved financial performance compared with prior periods. However, the ongoing transition to the SaaS business model may continue to present challenges to the Company\u2019s quarterly financial results during certain periods of fiscal 2018 when compared with the prior year.\nFinancial Overview\nThe following is a summary of key financial results for the quarter ended November 30, 2017:\nRevenue: Consolidated revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 20% and totaled $47.9 million compared with $39.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As mentioned above, the improvement in sales was primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred high-margin subscription revenues. In addition, the Company\u2019s sales were also favorably impacted by the acquisition of businesses in the second half of fiscal 2017, a large intellectual property contract that was obtained in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, increased onsite presentation revenue, and increased Education Division revenues. All Access Pass Contracts and Unbilled Deferred Revenue: For the quarter ended November 30, 2017, the Company invoiced $12.3 million of All Access Pass contracts and $5.1 million of related materials, compared with $7.1 million of AAP contracts and $6.4 million of related products in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. At November 30, 2017, the Company had $15.9 million of unbilled deferred revenue, which represents business that is contracted but unbilled, and excluded from its balance sheet. Gross profit: First quarter 2018 gross profit was $32.9 million compared with $25.3 million in the prior year. The Company\u2019s gross margin for the quarter ended November 30, 2017 increased to 68.6 percent of sales compared with 63.6 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in gross profit and gross margin was primarily due to the recognition of previously deferred revenue and the other factors described above. Operating Expenses: The Company\u2019s operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by $5.4 million compared with the prior year, which was primarily due to a $4.7 million increase in selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, and a $0.7 million increase in amortization expense. Increased SG&A expenses were primarily due to increased associate costs resulting from new sales and sales related personnel, especially in the Education Division, and increased commission expense on higher sales; and $1.2 million of increased expense associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities from previous business acquisitions. Increased amortization expense was due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations which occurred in the second half of fiscal 2017. Operating Income (Loss): The Company reported a loss from operations for the first quarter of $(3.3) million compared with a loss from operations of $(5.4) million in the first quarter of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $0.6 million, compared with a loss of $(2.8) million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Net Income (Loss): The Company reported a first quarter 2018 net loss of $(2.4) million compared with a net loss of $(4.0) million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, reflecting the above-noted factors. Cash and Liquidity Remain Strong: The Company\u2019s balance sheet and liquidity position remained healthy through the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company had $8.1 million of cash at November 30, 2017, compared with $8.9 million at August 31, 2017. At November 30, 2017, the Company had $21.0 million of available borrowing on its revolving line of credit facility. Fiscal 2018 Outlook: Based on anticipated increases in its SaaS business, the Company reaffirms its previously announced Adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2018, which is expected to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million.\nBob Whitman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \u201cWe were pleased that, as expected, the first quarter of fiscal 2018 represented an inflection point where the strong growth of our SaaS business more than offsets declines in our traditional facilitat"}

The probes are looking into allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election to help Republican Trump. Moscow denies interference and Trump denies any collusion. \nIn the letter released by the senators, Grassley and Graham neither identify anyone to whom they believed Steele lied nor do they identify any news outlet. The letter makes reference to a \u201cTop Secret\u201d memo that they said relates to \u201ccertain communications between Christopher Steele and multiple U.S. news outlets\u201d regarding the \u201cdossier.\u201d \nSteele had no immediate comment. \nAfter Trump won the Republican nomination in July 2016, backers of Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton started financing Steele\u2019s work via Washington research firm Fusion GPS. The firm had also worked on \u201copposition research\u201d for one of Trump\u2019s opponents in the Republican primary. \nIn an emailed comment, Joshua Levy, a lawyer for Fusion GPS, suggested that the senators\u2019 letter was an effort to undermine the special counsel\u2019s investigation. \n\u201cAfter a year of investigations into Donald Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, the only person Republicans seek to accuse of wrongdoing is one who reported on these matters to law enforcement in the first place,\u201d Levy said. \u201cWe should all be skeptical in the extreme.\u201d \nAlthough several news organizations, including Reuters, were briefed on Steele\u2019s dossier before the November 2016 election, most decided not to report on the material because its inflammatory and sometimes salacious content could not be verified. \nCongressional panels, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, set out to investigate U.S. intelligence agency allegations that Russia conducted a campaign of hacking and disinformation to undermine U.S. democracy in the election, but some of the bipartisanship has eroded. Graham, Grassley and some other Republicans have used official resources to investigate the Steele dossier, Trump critics and officials working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Mueller. \nTwo Trump campaign associates, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and aide George Papadopoulos have pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in Mueller\u2019s probe. \nU.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, on Friday criticized the Republicans\u2019 letter. \n\u201cThis action was taken without any bipartisan cooperation, or even consultation,\u201d Blumenthal said in a statement. \u201cThese vaguely stated, secret allegations seem designed more to distract attention from the priority issues for investigation, and discredit the FBI and other law enforcement.\u201d \nThe Democratic senator said it was \u201cindisputable fact\u201d that the probe of Russian meddling in the election and any possible Trump campaign role \u201cwas triggered by information completely independent from the dossier.\u201d Reporting By Mark Hosenball; editing by Grant McCool"}

Fresh from his $52.4 billion deal with Walt Disney, the media mogul may be a major beneficiary of a new book about dysfunction in President Donald Trump\u2019s White House. The expos\u00e9 is ripping apart the alliance between the president and his erstwhile aide and Breitbart News boss Steve Bannon.\nJournalist Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire and Fury\u201d is a scorcher aimed at the Oval Office. Bannon, chief strategist for all of seven months after running the tail end of Trump\u2019s election campaign, sets plenty ablaze, heavily criticizing both the president and his family.\nTrump said Bannon, who returned to his job as chairman of conservative news network Breitbart last summer, had \u201clost his mind.\u201d The president\u2019s lawyers threatened to sue Wolff\u2019s publisher, which responded by moving up the release to Friday. Breitbart\u2019s board is mulling whether to oust Bannon, and the Mercer family, one of the outlet\u2019s main shareholders, has distanced itself from him.\nMurdoch plays a relatively small part in this tale as a man whose approval the president craves: \u201cTrump would brag that Murdoch was always calling him; Murdoch, for his part, would complain that he couldn\u2019t get Trump off the phone,\u201d Wolff wrote.\nBut the repercussions of Wolff\u2019s tell-all could play into Murdoch\u2019s hands. Breitbart\u2019s influence in conservative circles has grown considerably, not least thanks to Bannon\u2019s rapport with Trump, despite its small size: Fox News brings in some $1.5 billion of profit a year, compared with just $1.5 million at Breitbart, according to the book. And Murdoch\u2019s network has been hit by a rash of sexual-harassment allegations that forced out both its architect - now-deceased Roger Ailes - and popular host Bill O\u2019Reilly.\nBannon\u2019s possible defenestration may turn the tables by hobbling Breitbart\u2019s clout. The timing couldn\u2019t be better: Murdoch is preparing to launch what executives are starting to refer to as New Fox - the mainly news-and-sports business that will be left once the deal with Disney is complete. Having his upstart rival wounded on the sidelines would make that transaction all the sweeter.\n "}

But a weaker-than-expected holiday season thwarted that strategy, and Toys R Us increasingly risks lagging behind the likes of Walmart , Target and Amazon as its sales wane.\nToday, in the U.S. alone, Toys R Us operates roughly 880 stores, including those under the Babies R Us brand.\nMany of these stores are leased back to a separate entity created by the company known as Toys R Us Property Co., or Propco. A handful of the retailer's locations are owned by real estate investment trusts including Kimco , Brixmor and DDR , and a smaller portion of stores are directly owned by the chain.\n\"The open question in the Toys case is what the impact will be on the two Propco loans that will be impacted by such real estate rationalization,\" Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea said.\nAs Toys R Us has borrowed money and secured loans with its physical assets, many of its stores today are still tied up in financing, O'Shea explained, resulting in a somewhat-conflicting situation as those stores go dark.\nAs for the remainder of Toys R Us' real estate not serving as collateral, similar to Wissink, O'Shea said he expects more closures to come as leases are terminated and negotiations with landlords progress.\n\"There is no doubt that shuttering loss-making shops will allow the company to save money and focus its efforts on other channels and locations,\" Neil Saunders managing director at GlobalData Retail, told CNBC.\n\"Unless Toys R Us finds a way to become relevant to consumers, these store closures will do very little to ensure the future viability of the company,\" Saunders said.\nMoving forward, Toys R Us has said it plans to invest more heavily in its website, loyalty program and Babies R Us registry offering.\nWith more store closures potentially on the horizon, certain competitors could reap more benefits from Toys R Us' downsizing than others (i.e. mom and pop shops).\nTarget is a top candidate to win customers' dollars, according to UBS analysts Arpine Kocharyan and Michael Lasser. Walmart also sits in close proximity to many of Toys R Us' stores, and Amazon continues to expand and promote its toy assortment online, as it did this past holiday season.\nThrough the first half of 2018, though, as Toys R Us closes this first round of stores and liquidation sales persist, other toy retailers are going to have to adjust their inventories in order to \"minimize risk,\" Jefferies' Wissink said. But demand should balance back out in the second half of the year and ahead of the 2018 holiday season.\n\"Clearance events during February, March, and April will coincide with holiday inventory exits and Easter, but generally reflect a three-month period of relatively small sales volume within the year,\" she added. Thus, \"the overall impact to the industry is likely to be less meaningful than events of this nature at other points in the year.\""}

Most of its assets, including its sister pages Deadspin, a sports site, and Jezebel, a feminist blog, were bought in 2016 for $135 million by media company Univision Holdings Inc. \nThiel has not said why he wants Gawker, though the potential acquisition would let him take down stories regarding his personal life that are still available on the website, and remove the scope for further litigation between him and Gawker. Thiel, who is Facebook Inc\u2019s first major investor and a co-founder of payment service PayPal Inc, did not respond to a request for comment. \nGawker\u2019s bankruptcy plan administrator Will Holden, of consulting firm Dacarba LLC, and the website\u2019s bankruptcy attorney Gregg Galardi, of law firm Ropes & Gray LLP, have tried to block Thiel\u2019s bid, according to court papers. \nGalardi in late November asked a U.S. bankruptcy court judge to deny Thiel\u2019s request to bid, according to court papers. He also argued Thiel is \u201cnot a \u2018proper\u2019 purchaser\u201d because he could end up as the target of litigation, according to court papers. \nThiel funded former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan\u2019s lawsuit against Gawker after the site published a sex tape featuring Hogan. The former wrestler, whose real name is Terry Bollea, won a $140 million judgment against the site, and later settled for $31 million. \nGawker in 2007 published a story about Thiel\u2019s homosexuality. \nMultiple bidders have submitted offers for the site, Holden said in a phone interview on Thursday. Holden will choose a winner as soon as this month, and then request approval for the deal from a U.S. bankruptcy court judge, the sources said. If Holden excludes Thiel\u2019s bid, Thiel could ask the judge to consider it if it is higher than rival offers. \nThe value of Thiel\u2019s bid could not be learned, though the sources said Gawker is only now worth a few million dollars. \nKevin Lee, the co-founder and executive chairman of Didit, a marketing firm, said he also submitted a bid, without disclosing its value. If successful, Lee said, he plans to use the site to raise money for readers\u2019 preferred charities. \nThe terms of the Univision sale restrict new articles from being published on Gawker until March 9. \nA group of former Gawker employees this week abandoned their effort to bid, one of the sources said. They had launched a campaign seeking $500,000 in donations through fundraising site Kickstarter, but failed to reach their goal and have returned the approximately $90,000 they did collect. \nReporting by Jessica DiNapoli; Editing by Daniel Wallis\n "}

Toru Yamanaka\u2014AFP\/Getty Images By Bloomberg 9:44 PM EST \nToshiba Corp. (tosbf) has agreed to sell claims in its Westinghouse U.S. nuclear unit to bolster its capital by 410 billion yen ($3.68 billion) by March, helping it to erase negative shareholder equity and avoid being delisted. \nThe Tokyo-based company plans to complete the sale of the claims to an entity controlled by the Baupost Group LLC this month, it said in a statement Thursday. The deal will generate after-tax profit of 170 billion yen. Toshiba shares rose as much as 2.9% in Tokyo. \nThe sale will end the Japanese conglomerate\u2019s troubled foray into overseas nuclear power, which started with the $5.4 billion acquisition of Westinghouse in 2006. Two power projects went billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule, forcing the U.S. entity to seek bankruptcy protection in March. The resulting multibillion-dollar losses pushed Toshiba\u2019s liabilities beyond its level of assets, threatening its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Toshiba was forced to put its crown-jewel semiconductor business up for sale to plug the hole in its balance sheet. \nThe nuclear asset sale and 600 billion yen raised in December through new share issuance together will resolve its capital shortage by the end of its fiscal year, Toshiba said in the statement. Under TSE\u2019s requirements, two straight years of negative shareholders equity are grounds for delisting. \nOver the past two months, Toshiba paid its guarantees on nuclear projects in South Carolina and Georgia, entitling it to a total of about $8.1 billion in claims against Westinghouse.

On two occasions, it said, he enlisted help from brokers to manipulate Libor. \nBetween 2008 and 2009, the watchdog said he entered into 28 \u201cwash trades\u201d, two identical trades that cancel each other out. \nThe trades had no legitimate purpose other than to pay two broker firms as thanks for personal hospitality Danziger had received, the FCA said in its statement. \nDanziger has denied that the trades and hospitality were connected. \nIn a notice of its decision on Danziger, the FCA detailed a phone call that one broker made to a colleague of Danziger\u2019s at RBS on June 26, 2009. \nThe broker said he had been out with Danziger the previous evening, and asked whether Danziger was in the office. He \u201cowes me a little switchy today\u201d, the broker is alleged to have said. \nThe FCA said that in a separate phone call with another individual on the same day, the broker said he had run up a 2,000 pound drinks bill that evening and that Danziger had told him to \u201cput a switch through\u201d. \nThe FCA said \u2018switch\u2019 was a term used for wash trade, and that Danziger executed one later that day. \nThe regulator first proposed action against Danziger in 2014, but this was put on hold due to a then ongoing investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.

That's one reason demand for freelancers and consultants is rising. Forrester predicts that spending on outsourced software help will accelerate by 6 percent in 2018.\nTo find the best possible contractors for the job, large firms, including Cisco , Ford and Orange Telecom, are using artificial intelligence from a San Jose start-up called Tara Intelligence.\nTara AI matches projects with freelance programmers who have the exact skills required to complete them. To do this, the start-up developed a \"scraping engine\" that constantly scours the open web, figuring out who worked on code that resembles a project that a business needs to get done.\nAccording to Tara AI CEO and co-founder Iba Masood: \"Developers give us access to their Github. We see projects similar in nature to what you are trying to build. And then we connect you to the right and available talent.\"\nTara AI's software also helps businesses automatically scope out and manage projects with freelancers, monitoring the pace and quality of their work, and making sure contractors are paid on-time for their code commits, for example.\nDevelopers who score work via Tara AI are paid flat rates, which are set automatically and correspond with a project's level of difficulty. Whether they're men, women, retirees or twenty-somethings with a fresh undergraduate degree, developers get paid the same wages for the same work.\n\"Some people are better at negotiating,\" Masood said. \"But we think developers should be paid based on their actual abilities and the work they deliver.\"\nTara AI faces competition from large tech consultancies like Tata or Insight Global, and freelancer and developer marketplaces online like Upwork, Codementor and Gigster.\nMasood says her company has just raised $3 million in seed funding to make its platform the go-to resource for businesses in need of contractors with specialized programming skills, especially in data analytics, machine learning and mobile.\nInvestors in Tara AI include: Y Combinator, Moment Ventures, GSV, Lattice VC and Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, among others.\nThe new funding will help Tara AI grow from about a dozen full-time employees today to 30 or more in the next year, and to establish a new office in Buffalo, New York. The company is also developing a set of bug prediction algorithms that can augment the skills of programmers, and help them cut down the time it takes to finalize their code."}

We throw them around in meetings, e-mails and important documents (such as resumes and client proposals), and they land, like fingernails across a chalkboard, on everyone who has to hear or read them.\nNo matter how talented you are or what you've accomplished, using words incorrectly can change the way people see you and forever cast you in a negative light.

It's bad enough to have a roomful of people witness your blunder and something else entirely to stumble in front of 100,000!\nOften, it's the words we perceive as being more \"correct\" or sophisticated that catch us by surprise when they don't really mean what we think they do. These words have a tendency to make even really smart people stumble.\nIronic vs. Coincidental A lot of people get this wrong. If you break your leg the day before a ski trip, that's not ironic \u2014 it's coincidental (and bad luck).\nIronic has several meanings, all of which include some type of reversal of what was expected. Verbal irony is when a person says one thing but clearly means another. Situational irony is when a result is the opposite of what was expected. O. Henry was a master of situational irony. In \"The Gift of the Magi,\" Jim sells his watch to buy combs for his wife's hair, and she sells her hair to buy a chain for Jim's watch. Each character sold something precious to buy a gift for the other, but those gifts were intended for what the other person sold. That is true irony.\nIf you break your leg the day before a ski trip, that's coincidental. If you drive up to the mountains to ski, and there was more snow back at your house, that's ironic.\nAffect vs. Effect To make these words even more confusing than they already are, both can be used as either a noun or a verb.\nLet's start with the verbs. Affect means to influence something or someone; effect means to accomplish something. \"Your job was affected by the organizational restructuring\" but \"These changes will be effected on Monday.\"\nAs a noun, an effect is the result of something: \"The sunny weather had a huge effect on sales.\" It's almost always the right choice because the noun affect refers to an emotional state and is rarely used outside of psychological circles: \"The patient's affect was flat.\"\nLie vs. Lay We're all pretty clear on the lie that means an untruth. It's the other usage that trips us up. Lie also means to recline: \"Why don't you lie down and rest?\" Lay requires an object: \" Lay the book on the table.\" Lie is something you can do by yourself, but you need an object to lay .\nIt's more confusing in the past tense. The past tense of lie is \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 lay : \"I lay down for an hour last night.\" And the past tense of lay is laid: \"I laid the book on the table.\"\nshow chapters Make your family more savvy around money with these fun ideas 11:35 AM ET Wed, 22 Feb 2017 | 01:28 Accept vs. Except These two words sound similar but have very different meanings. Accept means to receive something willingly: \"His mom accepted his explanation\" or \"She accepted the gift graciously.\" Except signifies exclusion: \"I can attend every meeting except the one next week.\"\nTo help you remember, note that both except and exclusion begin with ex .\nBring vs. Take Bring and take both describe transporting something or someone from one place to another, but the correct usage depends on the speaker's point of view. Somebody brings something to you, but you take it to somewhere else: \" Bring me the mail, then take your shoes to your room.\"\nJust remember, if the movement is toward you, use bring; if the movement is away from you, use take .\nBringing it all together English grammar can be tricky, and, a lot of times, the words that sound right are actually wrong. With words such as those above, you just have to memorize the rules so that when you are about to use them, you'll catch yourself in the act and know for certain that you've written or said the right one.\nDr. Travis Bradberry is the award-winning co-author of the No. 1 bestselling book, \"Emotional Intelligence 2.0\" and the co-founder of TalentSmart, the world's leading provider of emotional intelligence tests and training, serving more than 75 percent of Fortune 500 companies.\nLike this story?

(NASDAQ: CHSCP, CHSCO, CHSCN, CHSCM, CHSCL), the nation's leading farmer-owned cooperative and a global energy, grains and foods company, today reported net income of $180.1 million for the first quarter of its 2018 fiscal year (three-month period ended Nov. 30, 2017), compared to net income of $209.2 million for the same period a year ago.\nConsolidated revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $8.0 billion, the same as fiscal 2017. Pretax income was $199.6 million and $225.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\"Despite challenging market conditions, CHS experienced a solid first quarter thanks to our continued focus on three key priorities: strengthening relationships, sharpening operational excellence and restoring financial flexibility,\" said CHS President and Chief Executive Officer Jay Debertin. \"In the first quarter, we recorded solid earnings from our businesses and reduced long-term debt. These actions are helping to strengthen and grow CHS.\"\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, reporting segment results were:\nEnergy\nEnergy generated pretax income of $113.1 million during the first quarter, compared to $70.0 million during the same period last year. The $43.1 million increase was primarily driven by improved margins within refined fuels.\nAg\nThe Ag segment, which includes domestic and global grain marketing and crop nutrients businesses, renewable fuels, local retail operations, and processing and food ingredients, generated pretax income of $74.5 million for the three months ended Nov. 30, 2017, compared to $109.2 million for the same period the previous fiscal year. The $34.7 million decrease was primarily the result of lower margins in grain marketing, processing and food ingredients and renewable fuels. Lower volumes in grain marketing and processing and food ingredients also contributed to the decrease. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in earnings in the crop nutrients and country operations businesses.\nNitrogen Production\nThis segment is comprised of the company's investment in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CF Nitrogen), and generated pretax income of $5.7 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $27.0 million during the same time in fiscal 2017. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to a gain of $29.1 million from an embedded derivative associated with CF Nitrogen that was recognized in fiscal 2017. There was no comparable gain in the current fiscal year. This decrease was partially offset by higher urea and urea ammonium nitrate prices.\nFood\nThis segment is comprised of the company's investment in Ventura Foods, LLC (Ventura Foods), and generated pretax income of $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $10.6 million during the same period of fiscal 2017. The decrease in earnings was due to lower margins at Ventura Foods.\nCorporate and Other\nThis category is primarily comprised of the company's wheat milling joint venture and its financing, hedging and insurance operations, and generated pretax income of $5.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $8.7 for the same period of fiscal 2017. The decrease in earnings was due to lower earnings from the wheat milling joint venture and less interest revenue due to amending a receivables securitization agreement in late FY17, pursuant to which we no longer receive interest income from those receivables.\nCHS Inc.

This hydrogel is a liquid at temperatures below body temperature but begins to gel, harden, upon injection as the temperature increases to normal body temperature, thereby locking the particles in place. The particles emit a very high concentrated and contained beta irradiation to kill the tumor. The beta radiation has a short penetration distance so there is minimal collateral damage to healthy tissues outside of the injected area.\nRadioGel TM also has a short half-life \u2013 delivering more than 90% of its therapeutic radiation within 10 days. This compares favorably to other available treatment options requiring up to 6 weeks or more to deliver a full course of radiation therapy.

It lists an Eylea biosimilar at the preclinical stage on its pipeline chart, putting it behind the Momenta\/Mylan candidate. \nEylea, which treats a leading cause of blindness in the elderly - wet age-related macular degeneration - and related eye conditions, accounts for most of Regeneron\u2019s revenue. \nRegeneron shares fell 1.5 percent to $388 in extended trading. Momenta shares rose 6 percent to $15, while Mylan shares were unchanged from their Nasdaq close at $43.14. \nU.S. Eylea sales rose 12 percent in the third quarter to $953 million.

Massachusetts and Maine are on track to follow suit later this year. \nWith California and its 39.5 million residents officially joining the pack, more than one-in-five Americans now live in states where recreational marijuana is legal for purchase, even though cannabis remains classified as an illegal narcotic under U.S. law. \nThe marijuana market in California alone, which boasts the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy, is valued by most experts at several billion dollars annually and is expected to generate at least a $1 billion a year in tax revenue. \n\u201cAdding California to the regulated [recreational] market for cannabis is a really big deal,\u201d said Heather Azzi, a senior attorney for the Marijuana Policy Project, an advocacy group working to liberalize marijuana laws. \nUruguay became the first and only country to legalize recreational marijuana sales nationally, permitted through its pharmacies starting in July 2017, but is far smaller in comparison, with a population of just 3.4 million. \nStill, most California jurisdictions are sitting out the highly anticipated New Year\u2019s Day inauguration of recreational cannabis sales. \nMany, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, will not be ready for days or weeks because of additional red tape required by city and county governments before would-be retailers can obtain their state licenses.

REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage \nBut business will almost certainly be brisk at newly permitted shops ready on Day One. They number about four-dozen outlets across California, according to an authoritative guide to the cannabis market, GreenState, published by the San Francisco Chronicle. \nStores authorized to carry recreational weed were set to go on New Year\u2019s Day in San Diego, San Jose, Santa Cruz, Oakland, Berkeley, Eureka and Desert Hot Springs, among other locales. Hundreds more are expected to open throughout the state as the year progresses. \nMany previously operated strictly as medical cannabis dispensaries under a patchwork of local regulations, and will now be licensed by the state for recreational merchandise as well. Slideshow (9 Images) \nAmong the very first will be the Oakland-based Harborside dispensary, which has long ranked as the largest U.S. medical marijuana outlet. It planned to opens its doors at 6 a.m. local time on Monday. \nCustomers in the recreational sector - which state regulators prefer to call the \u201cadult use\u201d market - are only permitted to buy an ounce (28 grams) of raw cannabis or its equivalent at a time. \nMedical patients can buy unlimited quantities, but must present a doctor\u2019s note and have purchased a medical ID card. \nThe stage for Monday\u2019s grand opening was set when voters passed a ballot measure in November 2016, Proposition 64, immediately legalizing personal possession and use of recreational pot by adults 21 and over. \nBut it has taken California lawmakers and bureaucrats over a year to devise a licensing, regulatory and tax structure for all phases of the commercial distribution chain. \nCalifornia in 1996 became the first state to legalize marijuana for medical use, and more than 30 states have since done likewise.

The interview, which would deal with a limited portion of questions, could take place within the next several weeks, the Post said, citing a person close to the president. \nSekulow and Dowd did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the Washington Post report. White House attorney Ty Cobb declined to comment on it, saying it was policy not to comment on communications with the special counsel's office. \nEarlier on Monday, a source familiar with the issue said discussions about Trump's possible testimony have been going on among lawyers.

(AP) \u2014 The state of Oregon sued the agrochemical company Monsanto on Thursday over pervasive pollution from PCBs, the toxic industrial chemicals that have accumulated in plants, fish and people around the globe for decades. The company called the lawsuit baseless.\nThe lawsuit seeks $100 million to use to mitigate pollution, particularly along a 10-mile (16 kilometer) stretch of the Willamette River in Portland that will be the target of a $1 billion cleanup announced by federal authorities in 2016.\nOregon's lawsuit cites internal memos and correspondence indicating that Monsanto knew early on about the toxic effects of PCBs.\nA 1937 internal company memo said that exposure to vapors at high temperatures or ingestion of the substances by animals produced \"systemic toxic effects\" and prolonged skin contact could lead to an acne-like rash, the lawsuit alleged.\nMonsanto said in an emailed statement that the litigation undermined decontamination efforts in the Portland Harbor overseen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The agency declared the area a \"superfund site\" in 2000.\n\"Monsanto voluntarily stopped producing PCBs more than 40 years ago and didn't use or dispose of any PCBs in the state of Oregon. Cleanup efforts are underway in Oregon with the full group of responsible parties under supervision of the EPA, and it's most important that everyone stay focused on that work,\" said Scott S. Partridge, Monsanto's vice president of global strategy.\nIn Oregon, more than two dozen rivers and streams have tested positive for PCB contamination and fish and wildlife in more than 40 watersheds have also shown signs of pollution, according to court documents.\nA variety of fish species in Oregon are vulnerable because the PCBs accumulate in their fatty tissues. When seals, eagles, osprey, orca whales and humans eat those fish, that contamination is passed on, the lawsuit alleged.\nIn some cases, dead orca whales that washed up on shore have been treated as hazardous waste, the lawsuit said.\n\"PCBs cause a wide range of systemic toxic effects in humans and animals and can seriously impair the endocrine, neurologic, and reproductive systems,\" according to the lawsuit.\nPortland's harbor suffered the most pollution because it was lined for a century with businesses that relied heavily on PCBs for manufacturing, metal recycling, fuel storage, railways and other industrial uses.\nPCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, were used in many industrial and commercial applications \u2014 including paint, coolants, sealants and hydraulic fluids. Monsanto, based in Missouri, produced them from 1935 until Congress banned them in 1979.\nAccording to the EPA, PCBs have been shown to cause a variety of health problems, including cancer in animals as well as effects on the immune, nervous and reproductive systems.\nSeveral cities \u2014 including Portland, Oregon, and the California cities of Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose, Long Beach and San Diego \u2014have also sued Monsanto over PCB pollution. Washington became the first state to sue Monsanto over PCBs in 2016.\nThe new lawsuit said that a study included in a 1955 Monsanto internal report that said \"the toxicity of these compounds has been repeatedly demonstrated\" and that prolonged skin exposure could cause a \"serious and disfiguring dermatitis.\"\nA 1968 study of a waterway near a Monsanto plant characterized the creek as a \"potential source of future legal problems,\" the lawsuit said.\nYet Monsanto told officials around the country the contrary, the lawsuit alleged. In a letter to New Jersey's Department of Conservation that year, Monsanto wrote, \"Based on available data, manufacturing and use experience, we do not believe PCBs to be seriously toxic.\"\nOregon's lawsuit seeks damages for public nuisance, unjust enrichment and cites trespassing \u2014 saying the contamination hurt the state's natural resources.\nFollow Gillian Flaccus on Twitter at http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/gflaccus"}

Spotify declined to comment.\nIn the past, sources have told CNBC that Spotify would put a direct listing on the NYSE sometime during the fourth quarter of 2017 or first quarter of 2018, assisted by Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs , and Allen & Co. On Wednesday, sources added that Spotify had been trying to confidentially file in the fourth quarter, as early as October, but still didn't have SEC clearance.\nOnce Spotify obtained that clearance, it was able to file an F-1, an SEC document for foreign private issuers that serves as a catchall for first-time security offerings.\nSpotify, which was founded in Stockholm, initially thought that it may not need to do a quiet period or a traditional F-1. But as part of the SEC clearance process, it now needs both, sources said.\nAxios previously reported some details, citing unnamed sources, including that Spotify filed IPO documents in December for a public offering, citing unnamed sources.\nA direct listing is slightly different than a traditional IPO. During an IPO, the company offers investors shares first, which allows underwriters to set an initial price. A direct listing allows investors to buy shares only through the open market, with no predetermined price.\nNews of Spotify's F-1 filing comes on the heels of a new copyright lawsuit against the company. Wixen Music Publishing claims that Spotify used thousands of songs without a license .\nBut sources told CNBC that it is \"business as usual\" at Spotify, and the suit is not seen as overly concerning in terms of the public offering.\n\u2014 Written by CNBC's Anita Balakrishnan .

The quarter percentage point hike to 2 percent made the NBR the second central bank among those of the European Union's eastern nations to start to lift rates from record low levels, after two hikes by the Czech central bank (CNB) since August. While the CNB has the lowest inflation target in the region at 2 percent, markets have been gripped by overheating concerns in Romania where a surge in wages has helped the economy to grow by a stellar annual 8.8 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Between August and November, Romania's annual inflation rate surged two percentage points to 3.2 percent. In a Reuters poll, five analysts had expected the bank to hold fire, while four projected a quarter point hike. Some Romanian government debt prices eased, with 3-year papers bid at a yield of 3.45 percent, up 13 basis points according to Reuters data. The leu jumped more than a third of a percent against the euro past 4.62 after the decision. It gave up almost all of the gains to trade at 4.6335 at 1418 GMT, after NBR Governor Mugur Isarescu said the bank would consider the 5-6 percentage point range for leu moves as sustainable. The Polish central bank (NBP) is unlikely to follow the Czech and Romanian central bank rate hikes any time soon, after Polish figures for December showed lower-than-expected inflation. It is unlikely to encourage expectations for interest rate hikes at its meeting on Wednesday, and that could weigh on the zloty which hit six-and-a-half-year highs against the euro last week. It eased 0.3 percent to 4.1672 by 1418 GMT. The region's currencies generally started the year strengthening, lifted by a rise in risk appetite in global markets and the prospect of healthy economic growth in Central Europe. \"The zloty will probably not be helped by comments after the MPC (central bank) meeting,\" ING analysts said in a note, adding that a correction could weaken the zloty to 4.2 in the next couple of weeks, even though a big easing is unlikely. Erste analysts said in a note that they did not expect anything new from the NBP, and the zloty could stay flat.

The zloty gained 0.3 percent and the Czech crown 0.2 percent.\nThe crown and the forint set multi-week highs, and the zloty reached its strongest level since August 2015, at 4.1605\nPolish manufacturing grew at its fastest pace in 34 months.\nING senior economist Piotr Poplawski said the figures suggested that fourth-quarter annual economic growth was above 5 percent.\n\u201cHowever, the effect (on the zloty) may be short-lived, given the moderate chance that the data would encourage the NBP (Polish central bank) to hike rates,\u201d he said.\n\u201cClearly, the dollar\u2019s weakness translates into higher flows into our region, supporting the euro as well as us,\u201d he added.\nThe zloty set a 3-year high against the dollar at 3.4483.\nTrade was slow in the region as several markets, including the Polish stock exchange, stayed closed after the long New Year weekend.\nThe regional PMI data indicated robust demand from abroad and at home, fuelled by a fast rise in wages due to a region-wide labour shortage, after millions of workers moved to richer Western European countries.\n\u201cIt is still a fact that manufacturers have a difficult time with finding workers, which can hinder further growth,\u201d Komercni Banka analyst Viktor Zeisel said in a note.\nEconomic output figures may raise questions later this year about a possible rise in inflation pressures related to the labour shortage, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said.\n\u201cEconomic overheating, that is not a question right now, at least not yet,\u201d the trader said.\nHungarian government bonds were little changed on Tuesday.\nLong-term yields may drop further from current near-record-lows when the National Bank of Hungary launches long-term interest rate swap auctions later this month.\nThe facility and a scheme to buy mortgage notes are aimed at boosting mortgage lending at low fixed interest rates.\nThe Hungarian central bank has not showed any sign of worrying about inflation, which remains well within its target range, or a trend towards higher bond yields in core developed markets.

The issues have been resolved,\u201d spokeswoman Mpumi Sithole said.\nUnder the new structure, four of the Mapela Trust\u2019s nine trustees will be elected directly by local communities instead of just two that were picked by the chief to represent them.\nThe other trustees include an independent chairperson, the Kgoshi, a member of a traditional council, a member elected by village chiefs and a senior Amplats representative.\nAmplats\u2019 Sithole said the community would elect their representatives before any cash was allocated to local projects.\nProtests over the fund that erupted more than two years ago prompted the temporary closure of the Mogalakwena mine, leading to the loss of 8,600 ounces of its annual 200,000-plus ounces of production.\nLocal communities had hired prominent South African human rights lawyer Richard Spoor to spearhead their case.\nOther South African mining companies have also been cutting deals with tribal leaders who have royal titles and feudal-style control over their former homelands, often islands of rural poverty where most blacks were confined under apartheid.\nThe bulk of the platinum reserves in South Africa, the world\u2019s top producer of the precious metal, lie in or near these tribal areas.\nImpala Platinum and Lonmin have also had operations disrupted by community protests linked to deals with tribal chiefs.\nSocial and labor violence, alongside soaring costs and depressed world platinum prices, have made two-thirds of South Africa\u2019s platinum operations unprofitable at current prices, according to the country\u2019s Chamber of Mines.\nEditing by Edmund Blair\n "}

A Gaza economist said restoration of power from Israel, the enclave\u2019s main electricity supplier, could raise that figure to six hours. Gaza\u2019s sole power station generates only a small amount of electricity.\nIn April, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced he was cancelling the guarantee, part of a bid to press Hamas to loosen its hold over the enclave, a decade after the Islamist movement seized the territory from forces loyal to him.\nPrompted partly by Abbas\u2019s sanctions and fears of financial and political isolation, Hamas signed an Egyptian-brokered reconciliation agreement with his Fatah movement in October and agreed to hand over administrative control of the Gaza Strip to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority.\nBut both groups have failed to finalize details of the deal, which had been due to be completed on December 1. The Authority\u2019s decision to resume the electricity payments could help smooth the way towards completing the accord.\nThe PA\u2019s request coincides with heightened Israeli-Palestinian tensions.\nPalestinians have been mounting protests in the occupied West Bank and violence has flared along the Israel-Gaza border since U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Dec. 6 that he was recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\nIn the West Bank on Wednesday, Israeli troops shot dead a 17-year-old Palestinian during a confrontation with stone-throwing protesters, Palestinian medics said. An Israeli military spokeswoman said he appeared to have been holding a firearm.\nHis death raised to 13 the number of Palestinians killed in clashes with Israeli forces since Trump\u2019s declaration, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.

But most Americans who could benefit from them have never used them and most millennials in the red don't even understand how they work, according to a survey from CompareCards.com by Lending Tree . \nThe cards essentially let you move your credit card balance from a high-interest card to one that charges you no interest during a 0 percent introductory period, which typically lasts from six to 21 months, depending on the card. \n\"They can save you anywhere from hundreds to thousands upon thousands,\" Bruce McClary, the vice president of communications for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling , tells CNBC Make It . show chapters 10:18 AM ET Fri, 26 May 2017 | 00:58 \n\"The average household with revolving credit card debt pays $904 in interest a year,\" CNBC reports , citing a finding from NerdWallet. Using a balance transfer card, you temporarily escape those interest payments while you focus on getting out of the red. \n\"The goal is paying off the balance at the lowest possible interest rate without adding new debt back into the mix,\" says McClary. So make sure to first do the math. Figure out how much you need to pay each month to pay off your balance before the 0 percent introductory period is up. \nAccording to a study done by Consumer Intelligence, about a third of people with balance transfer cards fail to do this. That mistake could make your situation worse. Once the introductory period is up, the rate rockets to as high as 25 percent, reports WiseBread . \nAs a former credit counselor, McClary saw this firsthand. \"People took advantage of the balance transfer and ended up continuing their normal spending habits,\" he says. \"Instead of eliminating their debt, they essentially doubled it.\" \nTo ensure you're using a balance transfer card correctly, he also recommends avoiding making purchases with the card, because the 0 percent interest rate doesn't usually apply to new spending. show chapters 7:56 AM ET Mon, 24 July 2017 | 01:10 \nWhen you select a card, consider its one-time balance transfer fee, which ranges from 3 to 5 percent. If you have a large balance, you want to make sure what you will save outweighs that fee. \nAnd if you transfer the balance of multiple old credits cards, don't close them all at once, because that can hurt your credit score, says McClary. Waiting six months between each one you close is a good rule of thumb. \nUltimately, if used with the goal paying off your debt, balance transfer cards can be very effective. \nAnd, with debt hitting a record high in November, now could be an opportune time to try them. The federal funds rate also went up a quarter point last month. As CNBC reports , that hike will raise interest rates for people who carry a balance on their cards. \n\"Your debt will only grow faster and faster unless you take action,\" says Schulz. "}

By early December, foreign holdings of Treasury bills had hit a record 338 billion Egyptian pounds ($19 billion), up from 532 million pounds in mid-2016, central bank data showed. \nIn U.S. dollar terms, foreign holdings of Treasury bills are now nearly three times the previous high in 2010 - with about half the investment coming in the last few months of 2017. \nCharles Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital, estimates the Egyptian pound EGP= is 16 percent undervalued compared to its long-term average and with inflation EGCPY=ECI coming down from its 2017 peak of 33 percent, Egypt remains one of the most attractive emerging markets. Slideshow (2 Images) \nThe stock market, which has a capitalization of $45 billion, has also benefited from net inflows of foreign funds, which came to 7.5 billion pounds in 2017, the highest since a record 8.4 billion pounds in 2010, according to exchange data. \nSince the pound floated on Nov. 3, 2016 - slumping from 8.8 to the dollar to 17.7 now - the Egyptian blue-chip index .EGX30 has climbed more than 70 percent. \nRobertson expects the rally to continue for the next two years now the shock of the 2016 currency devaluation has passed, economic growth is picking up and high inflation is receding. \nGRAPHIC-Real effective FX Rates: reut.rs\/2CWIzJY DIRECT INVESTMENT \nMore importantly for Egypt\u2019s longer-term stability, investment by foreign companies and acquisitions by foreign private equity firms are rising - the kind of commitment that is less likely to be affected by short-term market fluctuations. \nEconomists say the fact Egypt has a population above 90 million, the third highest in Africa behind Nigeria and Ethiopia, coupled with a young and growing labor force make it an attractive destination. \nNet inflows of foreign direct investment into Egypt came to $7.9 billion in the year to the end of June, according to government data, helped by the energy sector. While below the government\u2019s $10 billion target, it was the fourth annual increase in a row and the highest since $8.1 billion in 2008-09. \nInflows peaked at $13.2 billion in 2007-08 before plummeting to $2.2 billion in 2011 during the Arab Spring uprising that ousted long-serving President Hosni Mubarak, disrupted the economy and ushered in years of political instability. \nPartly because of the improving outlook for gas supplies and a growing solar power industry, foreign private equity firms are expecting a surge in investment in the energy sector. \nHashem Fouad, chief investment officer at Dubai-based Enara Capital, said his firm was working with Chinese interests on opportunities in Egypt. \n\u201cWe achieved financial closes worth $200 million in the renewable energy sector in 2017 and expect more deals this year,\u201d he said. \nOthers are focusing on sectors likely to benefit as the economy expands, and exporters helped by the weaker currency. Solh at Gulf Capital said his firm was looking at companies in healthcare, education, water and food. \n\u201cWe are backing companies that are very export-oriented, earning hard currencies in dollars or euros so we are partially hedged to the currency,\u201d he said. \nGateway Partners is also focusing on export-orientated sectors and consumer industries. \n\u201cWe believe sectors related to consumer - retail, real estate, healthcare and education - and export manufacturing industries like textiles, agri-processing, and many other manufactured products are attractive,\u201d said Malas. \nThe impact of the devaluation on exports and imports, coupled with the surge in foreign fund inflows, has also helped Egypt start to address the chronic trade deficit and balance of payments problems that have plagued the country for a decade. \nThe central bank\u2019s foreign reserves surged to $37 billion in December from just over $24 billion a year earlier, while gross domestic product growth accelerated to 5.2 percent in the July-September quarter from 3.4 percent a year ago.

The pace of job growth is, however, expected to slow this year as the labor market hits full employment. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 148,000 jobs in December after surging by 252,000 in November.\nThursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 35,000 to 1.87 million in the week ended Dec. 30, the lowest level since December 1973.

He was 91. \n\u201cOne of the greatest entrepreneurs of the 20th century, Ingvar Kamprad, has peacefully passed away at his home in Smaland, Sweden, on Jan. 27,\u201d Ikea said in an emailed statement on Sunday. The founder of Ikea, as well as a bank for its customers, Ikano, \u201cwas \u201csurrounded by his loved ones,\u201d and died \u201cfollowing a short illness.\u201d \nKamprad had an estimated net worth of $58.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making him the world\u2019s eighth-richest person. The wealth was accumulated by producing furniture for the masses that was affordable and easy to transport. The Ikea flat packs revolutionized the way in which tables, chairs and other items could be stored and shipped, before being assembled by the customer. \n\u201cWe are mourning the loss of our founder and dear friend Ingvar,\u201d Jesper Brodin, chief executive officer of the Ikea Group, the largest retailer in the Ikea franchise system, said in a statement. \u201cHis legacy will be admired for many years to come and his vision \u2013- to create a better everyday life for the many people -\u2013 will continue to guide and inspire us.\u201d Frugal Billionaire \nKamprad was known for driving an old Volvo, recycling tea bags and taking home little packets of salt and pepper from restaurant visits. He was known as \u201cUncle Scrooge\u201d and \u201cThe Miser\u201d in the Swiss village of Epalinges, near Lausanne, where he moved in the 1970s before returning to Sweden a few years ago. He also avoided wearing suits and ties and traveled coach when flying. \nIkea\u2019s corporate culture mirrors Kamprad\u2019s celebration of frugality. Executives of the company travel on low-cost airlines and lodge in budget hotels. Its employees follow a basic pamphlet written by Kamprad in 1976, \u201cThe Testament of a Furniture Dealer,\u201d which states that \u201cwasting resources is a mortal sin,\u201d and stipulates Ikea\u2019s \u201cduty to expand.\u201d \nBrodin, who during his career at Ikea worked for 10 years as an assistant to Kamprad, said in a phone interview on Sunday that the billionaire \u201cstarted as a 17-year-old with two empty pockets, but a ton of entrepreneurship. He used to tell me that he never knew it would become so big.\u201d \nKamprad\u2019s death \u201cwill affect us all and we\u2019ll take time to be sad and reflect on what Ingvar achieved,\u201d Brodin said. \nCondolences poured in from politicians, business leaders and royalty. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said his country had lost a \u201cunique entrepreneur who meant a lot to Sweden\u2019s business community.\u201d \nForeign Minister Margot Wallstrom said Kamprad \u201cpre-eminently put Sweden on the world map. A fantastic entrepreneur who contributed to bringing Sweden out into the world. My thoughts are with his family and relatives.\u201d The Ikea Experience \nEntire families descended on the company\u2019s stores each week and Ikea\u2019s merchandise became ubiquitous. Shoppers drop off their children at Ikea day-care centers, dine at Ikea restaurants and select from among thousands of products ranging from leather sofas to soup ladles. In 2017, 403 Ikea stores in 49 countries received 936 million visitors, and the chain generated sales of 38.3 billion euros ($47.6 billion). \nU.K. style magazine Icon in 2005 named Kamprad the most influential taste-maker in the world, and wrote \u201cif it wasn\u2019t for Ikea, most people would have no access to affordable contemporary design. The company has done more to bring about an acceptance of domestic modernity than the rest of the design world combined.\u201d \nThe name Ikea is made up of the founder\u2019s initials and the first letters of the Elmtaryd farm and Agunnaryd village where he was raised. His flat-pack furniture was invented by Ikea employee Gillis Lundgren in 1956 when he tried to fit a table into the back of a car. Realizing the table was too bulky, Lundgren removed the legs. Storing and selling Billy book shelves or entire kitchens in pieces has let Ikea cut storage space and fill its trucks with more goods. \nThe concept of having customers pick up most of their own furniture in adjacent warehouses and transport it home for self-assembly also helped drive down costs. Childhood Business \nIngvar Feodor Kamprad was born March 30, 1926, near the southern Swedish town of Almhult. His father, Feodor, looked after the family farm and his mother, Berta, ran a lodging house on the property during the summer. At age 5, Kamprad started his business ventures by selling matches to his neighbors. Buying in bulk in Stockholm and selling at a premium in smaller quantities, he got his introduction to a business practice he would cherish at Ikea. \nThe entrepreneur, who was still attending high school in Gothenburg, moved on to fish, Christmas-tree decorations, seeds and pencils, which he sold from his bicycle. Founding Ikea in 1943, Kamprad then started marketing pens, wallets and nylon stockings in the local media, and distributed them using a milk van. He began selling furniture in 1948. \nIn the 1990s, Kamprad found himself under attack when his association with a pro-Nazi group, five decades earlier, came to light. Kamprad apologized to Ikea employees, saying his membership was the \u201cgreatest mistake of his life.\u201d \nIkea opened its first store in Almhult, Sweden, in 1958. \nKamprad stepped down as CEO in the late 1980s. He continued to wield power as an adviser to the holding company, and he designed an ownership structure to ensure Ikea\u2019s future survival and independence. An Ikea employee magazine in 2012 revealed that his three sons had been given more active roles at the closely held company. In 2013, he relinquished his role as chairman of Inter Ikea Group. \n\u201cSince 1988 Ingvar Kamprad did not have an operational role within Ikea but he continued to contribute to the business in the role of senior advisor, sharing his knowledge and energy with the Ikea co-workers,\u201d the company said on Sunday.

REUTERS\/Steve Marcus\/File Photo \nLG Electronics Inc ( 066570.KS ) chose Google for televisions it unveiled this week, but opted for Alexa in refrigerators because of its online shopping functionality. BIG BRANDS NOT ONLY PLAYERS \nWhen Lenovo Group Ltd ( 0992.HK ) decided to create an assistant-enabled screen last summer that would sit on a kitchen counter like a mini-TV, it turned to Google. That was due to a many-year relationship that would help the PC maker get the product in stores fast, said Jeff Meredith, vice president for consumer computers and smart devices at Lenovo. \nThe biggest brands are not the only players in voice assistants. \nTelevision maker TCL Corp ( 000100.SZ ) is turning to video set top box manufacturer Roku Inc ( ROKU.O ), which makes TCL\u2019s TV operating system and has data on TCL customers that could improve personalisation, said Chris Larson, senior vice president for North America at TCL. \nRoku\u2019s assistant will be less complicated than Google or Alexa, and TCL had to stick to one assistant because it would too expensive to support multiple models, Larson added. \nJBL, by comparison, offers several speaker models, each with a different assistant. \nPeople can use a speaker with Cortana for Skype calls and access to their Outlook work calendar, said Michael Mauser, president of lifestyle audio at JBL parent Harman Kardon, a Samsung Electronics Co ( 005930.KS ) subsidiary. \nUsers who want multiple speakers find Google\u2019s linking functionality more appealing, he said. \nFord Motor Co\u2019s ( F.N ) announced a year ago that Alexa would come to cars. That followed outreach by Amazon, which had seen social media posts about people using the portable Echo Dot smart speaker in their vehicles, said David Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices and services.

Since then, he and President Donald Trump have said those remarks were taken out of context. Mnuchin and Trump spoke as they attended the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\"I made the comment two days ago in a press gaggle in the morning. What I said was actually very even-handed and consistent with what I said before,\" Mnuchin said Friday in an interview on CNBC's \" Squawk Box .\" He added a strong \"long-term dollar\" is in the country's best interests.\nHowever, comments from the president and Treasury secretary did little to boost the dollar . In early trading, the currency was down about 0.4 percent against a basket of its global competitors, though it was off the lows of the session.\nMnuchin's comments were nothing terribly new from the administration. Trump himself has said in the past that he prefers a weak greenback.\nFor his part, the Treasury secretary repeated that he is not trying to influence the currency markets.\n\"Had the news printed my entire transcript the first time as opposed to just taking out one little point and kind of imply that I was trying to talk down the dollar, which I wasn't doing,\" he said. \"As a matter of fact I was very clear in my open, saying the dollar is the most liquid trading market in the world, and where the dollar is in the short term is not of concern to us, and we respect that the market sets where the dollar is.\"\nHe added that it is not the policy of the administration to intervene in the currency markets.\nBank of America Merrill Lynch strategists also think the markets misinterpreted Mnuchin's comments and should be focusing on what he said about the long-term dollar direction rather than the short-term market vagaries.\n\"Mnuchin's statements, when taken in their entirety, reaffirm the existing strong USD policy by linking dollar value to relative US economic fundamentals ... while implicitly acknowledging a more competitive and thus growth-supportive USD valuation situation vs. this time last year. Recent comments by President Trump would seem to confirm our read,\" BofAML said in a note to clients."}

(\u201cViamet Pharmaceuticals\u201d) today announced that it has entered into an agreement with NovaQuest Capital Management, L.L.C. (\u201cNovaQuest Capital\u201d) for the acquisition of Viamet Pharmaceuticals, including the company\u2019s product candidate, VT-1161, which successfully completed Phase 2b clinical trials for the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) and onychomycosis, or fungal nail infection. Upon closing of the acquisition, Viamet Pharmaceuticals will be a portfolio company of NovaQuest Capital, which will focus on further development of VT-1161 and related assets. Viamet Pharmaceuticals is a subsidiary of Viamet Pharmaceuticals Holdings, LLC, which will retain ownership of the remaining Viamet group of companies and assets, including worldwide rights to the MIDAS (Metalloenzyme Inhibitor Design And Synthesis) technology platform and development programs addressing invasive fungal infections, oncology and orphan diseases.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20180103005247\/en\/\nKey members of Viamet Pharmaceutical\u2019s development team will be employed by the NovaQuest Capital portfolio company, which will maintain operations in Research Triangle Park, N.C. NovaQuest Capital Partner, Patrick Jordan, will assume the role of the company\u2019s interim Chief Executive Officer. Robert Schotzinger, M.D., Ph.D., will remain as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Viamet group of companies.\n\u201cThe team at NovaQuest Capital has been providing novel solutions to the biopharmaceutical industry to fund the development and commercialization of key assets for nearly two decades. Our team has become increasingly involved in operations with our partner companies, and this acquisition is a logical next stage in the evolution of our business,\u201d said Ron Wooten, Chief Investment Officer and Founding Partner of NovaQuest Capital.\n\u201cThere were many partnering opportunities for VT-1161 that arose given the impressive positive data that emerged from the Phase 2b trials in RVVC and onychomycosis. A key criterion for us when evaluating these opportunities was the commitment of the partner to the areas of women\u2019s health and dermatology. In NovaQuest, we found a partner that shared our vision and enthusiasm regarding the need to advance novel treatments in these underserved therapeutic areas,\u201d said Dr. Schotzinger. \u201cAt the Viamet group, we will continue to focus on leveraging our metalloenzyme expertise in therapeutic areas including infectious disease, oncology and orphan diseases. We believe that VT-1161 is only the first of many exciting future candidates that will emerge from our MIDAS technology.\u201d\n\u201cThe data for Viamet Pharmaceutical\u2019s VT-1161 program are very compelling, and we see the potential for VT-1161 to become a centerpiece for NovaQuest Capital in the fields of women\u2019s health and dermatology,\u201d said Mr. Jordan. \u201cVT-1161 has demonstrated a high degree of potency against Candida species, and potentially a higher barrier to drug resistance. Furthermore VT-1161 may avoid the side effects that limit the use of current oral antifungal therapies, such as liver toxicity and drug-drug interactions, underscoring its potential to be a first-in-class treatment option for patients with RVVC and a best-in-class treatment option for patients with onychomycosis.\u201d\nApproximately 5 to 8 percent of women of childbearing age suffer from RVVC, and there are currently no approved therapies in the United States. RVVC can lead to intense discomfort and a substantial negative impact on psychological well-being. Onychomycosis, a fungal infection that primarily involves the nail, nail bed and surrounding tissues, is an extremely common infection, affecting approximately 32 million individuals in the United States. It can be a significant medical issue for diabetics or other patients with compromised immune systems or poor circulation of the lower extremities.\nFinancial terms of the acquisition are not being disclosed. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Guggenheim Securities, LLC acted as financial advisor, and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP acted as legal advisor, to Viamet Pharmaceuticals. Wyrick Robbins Yates & Ponton LLP acted as legal advisors to NovaQuest Capital.\nAbout VT-1161\nVT-1161 is a potent and selective, orally-administered inhibitor of fungal CYP51 which has successfully completed Phase 2b clinical trials for the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), a common and difficult to treat infection in women, and onychomycosis, or fungal nail infection. VT-1161 blocks the production of ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane. In preclinical studies, VT-1161 has demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against both Candida species and dermatophytes, including those species that cause RVVC and onychomycosis. Given the clinical and preclinical profile of VT-1161, Viamet Pharmaceuticals believes that it may avoid the side effects that limit the use of current oral antifungal therapies, such as liver toxicity and drug-drug interactions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track designations to VT-1161 for the treatment of RVVC .\nAbout NovaQuest Capital Management, L.L.C.

Azar also vowed to uphold Obamacare as long as it remained the law but said that the program needed changes.\n\"I believe I have a very important obligation to make the program work as well as possible,\" Azar said during the wide-ranging hearing that lasted more than two hours. \"What we have now is not working for people.\"\nRepublicans have been trying to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. Repealing and replacing Obamacare was one of President Donald Trump's most frequently repeated campaign promises but Congress has repeatedly tried and failed to do so.\nAzar said he favored elements of a Republican Senate Obamacare repeal bill that failed to garner enough support last year, which would have fundamentally restructured Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor and disabled.\nThe doomed measure proposed repealing enhanced federal funding for Medicaid under Obamacare and instead providing block grants to states based on the number of enrollees in each state. The block grants, coupled with the repeal of Medicaid expansion, would slash funding to the 31 states that expanded the government program under Obamacare.\nAzar said he supported that element of the legislation because it would provide states more flexibility in deciding how to run their Medicaid programs. Some Republican lawmakers have floated the idea of taking on Medicaid reform as a legislative priority this year.\nAzar spent about a decade at Eli Lilly & Co, including five years as president of its U.S. unit. Democrats on Tuesday pointed to a handful of Lilly drugs whose prices more than doubled under Azar's watch and fiercely questioned how seriously he would work to make prescription drugs more affordable.\nDuring the questioning, Azar did not dismiss the possibility of allowing Medicare, the government health program for the elderly, to negotiate drug prices, a favored proposal among Democrats.\nAzar vowed to work with Republicans and Democrats on his four top priorities: drug pricing, making healthcare more affordable and helping people who cannot purchase insurance on the Obamacare market, Medicare reform and the opioid epidemic.\nSenator Ron Wyden, the top-ranking Democrat on the committee, said Azar's promise to work on a bipartisan basis was a welcome change from the previous health secretary, Tom Price, who Wyden said did not work with Democrats.\nPrice, a former U.S. Republican Representative, resigned in September amid a furor over his use of expensive taxpayer-funded private charter jets for government travel.

[nL1N1P204P] \nInternational flights to Terminal 4 were suspended and passengers who had already arrived there were diverted to other terminals, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport. \nThe airport on Twitter advised travelers to check with their airlines before arriving. \n\u201cThere are about 3 inches (7.5 cm) of water inside the west end of Terminal 4, we have maintenance crews on the scene mopping and cleaning up,\u201d Scott Ladd, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said in an email. \nPort Authority police and the Fire Department of New York were on the scene and assisting Port Authority operations managers and maintenance personnel, and the cause of the rupture was still being investigated, Ladd said. \nThe flooding hit just as the airport was crawling back to normal after a winter storm labeled a \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d forced the airport to close on Thursday. \nWhen operations resumed on Friday, the backlog led to hundreds more delays or cancellations, crowding the terminals with stranded passengers. \nMore than 500 flights into or out of JFK were canceled and nearly 1,400 delayed from Friday morning to Sunday afternoon, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware. \nThe extreme cold and recovery from Thursday\u2019s snow storm created a \u201ccascading series of issues for the airlines and terminal operators,\u201d the Port Authority said. \nEquipment froze and baggage handling was delayed, which was compounded by staff shortages and heavier than normal passenger loads, the Port Authority said. The backlog left passengers stuck on planes for long stretches while waiting for other aircraft to get in and out of gates. Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Sandra Maler"}

An unexpectedly harsh cold snap across North America resulted in record gas demand New Year's Day, while at the same time natural gas producers from Pennsylvania to North Dakota are being forced to shut in some production at the well head due to the cold temperatures.\n\"We could consume upwards of a quarter of the stored natural gas just this month,\" said John Kilduff, energy analyst with Again Capital. The Energy Information Administration releases weekly data Thursday, and Kilduff said he's looking for a draw down of 225 billion cubic feet, more than double the normal level for this time of year.\n\"Things could start to get tight for sure. Even if we have a normally cold winter, things get tight,\" he said. \"These are big demand numbers we're seeing. Monday was a record. I think Saturday could eclipse Monday's record.\" Analysts said about 143 billion cubic feet of gas was consumed Monday, the largest on any one day in four years.\nThe U.S. is the biggest natural gas producer in the world, and analysts see no chance that supplies will run out or be unavailable but a shortage could mean prices will be higher. \nThe unexpected cold spell across North America is now being compounded by a massive winter storm, dubbed a bomb cyclone, that is expected to create blizzard conditions in parts of New England, and potentially dump more than a foot of snow.\nThe storm is expected to run up the east coast, creating huge surf and high winds and bringing an even colder wave of frigid temperatures to a third of the eastern half of the U.S. by the weekend. Freezing rain or snow is expected from Florida to Canada.\nNatural gas futures Wednesday were down 2.2 percent to $2.98 per million British Thermal Units, off a high of $3.10 per mBtus Tuesday.\n\"Overnight we saw warming trends in the 12-to-15 day forecast and the 16-to-21 day,\" said Bespoke Weather chief weather analyst Jacob Meisel. \"We're still expecting what could be a record drawdown next Thursday by the EIA for the week ending this Friday. That would include the three day holiday weekend for New Year's.\"\nMeisel said the futures market is now expecting natural gas storage to be 1.265 trillion cubic feet by the end of winter, compared to the five-year average of 1.7 trillion cubic feet.\n\"What the market is focusing on right now is the comparison to the five year average, and we're going to walk into the spring season with stockpiles below the five year average. The question is whether we're able to produce our way out of the problem,\" he said. \"I'm confident in saying we're basically walking into spring, 2018 with a shortage of gas.\"\nThat means gas prices could be higher. In the cash market Wednesday, prices have been volatile, and Meisel said Henry Hub cash have been volatile and hit a high over $7 Wednesday. \n\"If there was some sustained cold through the winter, we could see draw downs as low as 1,000 bcfs,\" Meisel said. \"Right now we're just trying to figure out this warm up. We are having one more cold shot that will be focused Jan. 12 to 14, that spooked the market a little bit [Tuesday'. There are concerns cold could stick around a little longer than anticipated. That's what would get the market going if the warmer weather we're expecting isn't ending up verifying.\"\nS&P Global Platts analysts said they believe the potential for supply shortages is in fact, limited by the rapid production. \"Indeed the notion of \"just in time\" shale production is going to change the way market prices during the peak period for winter demand,\" they noted, adding that New England is a market where consumers high prices due to insiffucient investment in midstream delivery and therefore pay high prices during peak demand.\nMeisel said it's possible colder weather could return by the end of January or early February . \"The forecast at this point is highly uncertain,\" he said.\nEven so, the weather has already been historic. The city of Boston tied its own 100-year-old record on Tuesday when it experienced seven consecutive days of temperatures that did not top 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures were expected to be in the mid 20s degress Fahrenheit Wednesday."}

Intel, Nvidia and Amazon were among companies with self-driving car announcements this week at CES. Getty Images Intel Corp. Senior Vice President and CEO and Chief Technology Officer of Mobileye Amnon Shashua (L) speaks in front of a Ford Fusion with Mobileye autonomous driving technology during a keynote address by Intel Corp. \nThe promise of self-driving cars has gone mainstream, and this week's massive CES trade show was proof. \nAmazon , Intel , Nvidia and Cisco all made announcements about autonomous driving at CES, joining a host of rivals and partners that have publicly reported their efforts. To accommodate, the annual Las Vegas trade show expanded its space for self-driving technologies this year by over one third. \nThey're coming late to the game: Alphabet's Waymo, Elon Musk's Tesla and the auto giants have all been developing self-driving technology for years. But nearly all the major tech companies now agree that the market potential is too big to ignore. \nHere's where the 12 most valuable U.S. tech companies are focusing their investment in autonomous driving, ranked by market cap from biggest to smallest. Apple Source: Apple Inc. Apple CarPlay. \nRumors of an Apple Car were put to bed last year when CEO Tim Cook said the company was working on \"autonomous systems,\" or software that could power self-driving cars. That was a relief to investors who worried about Apple taking on Tesla , Toyota , GM and other car manufacturers. \nCook hasn't made firm promises about self-driving technologies or dates by which they'll hit the market. Apple is partnering with Hertz to test its autonomous software in some of the company's rental cars (Lexus SUVs) on the streets of San Francisco, according to filings with the California Department of Motor Vehicles. \nSiri, CarPlay and other Apple software will probably get more usage once autonomous vehicles become a reality and drivers are free to pay attention to their screens, not the road. Alphabet \nGoogle has been talking up autonomous vehicles since 2009 when Sebastian Thrun launched the company's groundbreaking driverless car effort. \nIn late 2016, Alphabet renamed its self-driving car unit Waymo. Seen as a leader in the nascent industry, Waymo is building an end-to-end self-driving system filled with sensors and software so \"you can go door to door without taking the wheel,\" as its website says. Waymo claims to have 4 million miles of real-world driving experience and data gathered from cities including Mountain View, California, as well as Austin and Phoenix. \nWaymo has an early-rider program in Phoenix that lets people use its autonomous cars for their daily transportation needs. It's teaming up with Avis to make the vehicles rentable. The company has also partnered with AutoNation to provide vehicle maintenance and support, and with Intel for processors to power the cars. Microsoft VCG | Getty Images Baidu driverless cars in test run during the 3rd World Internet Conference (WIC) on November 17, 2016 in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province of China. \nMicrosoft has a number of partnerships with automakers developing internet-connected and autonomous vehicles including BMW, Ford, Renault-Nissan, Toyota and Volvo. But its most intriguing deal in this new market is with the Chinese internet company Baidu . \nBaidu is developing an open source platform that it hopes will become the \"Android\" of self-driving cars, dubbed Apollo. Microsoft joined Baidu's Apollo \"alliance,\" gaining a channel for sales of Azure cloud services to companies that use Apollo to build and run their self-driving cars. That deal only applies to companies using Apollo outside of China. \nAdditionally, Microsoft has partnered with and provides Azure cloud services to Ola, Uber's competitor in India, which is expected to offer self-driving vehicles on its app eventually. Amazon Getty Images \nAmazon's efforts in autonomous transportation appear most focused on getting items to consumers as quickly and efficiently as possible. \nAt CES, Amazon was part of a Toyota announcement evealing a self-driving food delivery vehicle called the e-Pallette, just a concept car for now. According to NBC News , Tim Collins, a vice president for Amazon Logistics, said that the partnership with Toyota allows Amazon to \"collaborate and explore new opportunities to improve the speed and quality of delivery for our customers.\" \nThe Wall Street Journal reported in April that Amazon has cobbled together a team of about a dozen people to work on driverless vehicles for delivery. And in January, Recode reported on a patent that was awarded to Amazon for autonomous cars navigating reversible lanes. Facebook Sheryl Sandberg speaks about overcoming grief and resilience at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. \nChief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg traveled to Germany in September to address the prestigious Frankfurt Motor Show, attended by Chancellor Angela Merkel . \n\"We're the only company in Silicon Valley that's not building a car,\" she quipped. \nAmong the big five tech companies, Facebook has perhaps the smallest role in the car itself, but Sandberg was in Frankfurt to talk about its sponsorship of a \"new mobility world,\" tying together the auto and tech industry. \nFacebook's research in virtual and augmented reality will potentially be used to give consumers a feel for the autonomous driving experience. It's all pretty vague right now. Intel Source: Mobileye A still image from a Mobileye video. \nThe chipmaker wants to become one of the world's biggest automotive suppliers. To that end, it acquired Mobileye for around $15.3 billion last year and partnered with Waymo to provide sensors and connectivity. \nMobileye, out of Israel, makes systems used for collision detection and other features in self-driving vehicles. Intel made a number of self-driving vehicle announcements at CES. It revealed that BMW, Nissan and Volkswagen all plan to use Mobileye technology to create \"high-definition maps\" that enable self-driving cars to get around safely. \nThe company is building a test fleet of 100 cars and showed off one of them at the show. The cars are equipped with twelve cameras, radar and laser scanners, and other chips, processors and systems developed by Intel and Mobileye. Oracle David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle Corp., speaks during the Oracle OpenWorld 2016 conference in San Francisco, on Sunday, Sept. 18, 2016. \nFinding a role for Oracle in the self-driving revolution will be quite a stretch. The closest thing we've heard so far is co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison refer to a \"self-driving database.\" \nIn a September earnings call with analysts, Ellison compared the database of the future with the car of the future. \n\"Self-driving cars eliminate the labor cost of driving, plus the high cost associated with human driving errors,\" he said. \"Self-driving database eliminates the labor cost of tuning, managing, and upgrading the database, thus avoiding all of the costly downtime associated with human error.\" \nIn other words, don't expect Oracle to drive you to and from work.

This is Sy. \nTennis legend Serena Williams is widely regarded as one of the greatest athletes on the planet, and perhaps ever. She recently achieved another stunning milestone\u2014saving her own life after giving birth, according to a fascinating profile in Vogue . And Williams\u2019 harrowing experience serves as a high-profile microcosm of the racial inequities which still haunt the American medical system. \nVogue outlines how Williams, who suffers from blood clots and must take anti-clotting medication because of it, knew that something had gone terribly wrong just a day after giving birth to her child: \nThe next day, while recovering in the hospital, Serena suddenly felt short of breath. Because of her history of blood clots, and because she was off her daily anticoagulant regimen due to the recent surgery, she immediately assumed she was having another pulmonary embolism. (Serena lives in fear of blood clots.) She walked out of the hospital room so her mother wouldn\u2019t worry and told the nearest nurse, between gasps, that she needed a CT scan with contrast and IV heparin (a blood thinner) right away. The nurse thought her pain medicine might be making her confused. But Serena insisted, and soon enough a doctor was performing an ultrasound of her legs. \u201cI was like, a Doppler? I told you, I need a CT scan and a heparin drip,\u201d she remembers telling the team. The ultrasound revealed nothing, so they sent her for the CT, and sure enough, several small blood clots had settled in her lungs. Minutes later she was on the drip. \u201cI was like, listen to Dr. Williams!\u201d \nSuch a scrape with death makes for a sensational story when it features an icon; but it\u2019s also the story of millions of women of color across the nation, as ProPublica explores in a searing investigative series on the effect socioeconomics has on motherhood in America . \nOne piece in that series, titled \u201cHow Hospitals Are Failing Black Mothers,\u201d carries special poignance given Williams\u2019 ordeal. \u201cIt\u2019s been long-established that black women\u2026 fare worse in pregnancy and childbirth, dying at a rate more than triple that of white mothers. And while part of the disparity can be attributed to factors like poverty and inadequate access to health care, there is growing evidence that points to the quality of care at hospitals where a disproportionate number of black women deliver, which are often in neighborhoods disadvantaged by segregation,\u201d writes Annie Waldman. \nIndeed, the public data highlights that when it comes to death and disease , from cancer to blood disorders to postpartum complications, the American medical system has a stubborn and long-standing racial gap. \nRead on for the day\u2019s news, and enjoy your weekend. We\u2019ll be back on Tuesday following the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Sy Mukherjee @the_sy_guy DIGITAL HEALTH \nTelemedicine may actually help you lose weight. A new study suggests telemedicine can help people keep track with their weight loss goals, according to MobiHealthNews. \u201cOur findings suggest that health coaching using a telemedicine-based weight loss program may be effective at reducing clinically significant body weight (more than 5 percent) in obese adults,\u201d wrote the study authors. \u201cThe current weight loss program combines three key elements shown to improve weight loss outcomes: a low-calorie diet with a preference for low glycemic carbohydrates, physical activity monitoring, and support for behavior change through a multi-disciplinary approach to treatment.\u201d ( MobiHealthNews ) INDICATIONS \nAstraZeneca scores an expansion for its \u201cPARP\u201d cancer drug. British drug giant AstraZeneca has won Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its cancer drug Lynparza to treat certain types of metastatic breast cancer . It\u2019s a particularly significant label expansion for the drug because it\u2019s part of a new class of treatments called \u201cPARP inhibitors\u201d\u2014and, until now, these kinds of drugs had only been approved for ovarian cancers, suggesting there\u2019s a far bigger market for the treatment type. THE BIG PICTURE \nA presidential checkup. President Donald Trump will be getting a physical exam today, his first medical checkup since assuming the presidency. That\u2019s fairly par for the course, but there\u2019s bound to be some added drama to this presidential physical given the renewed chatter about Trump\u2019s mental fitness (a conversation that some mental health experts have called essential while others have slammed it as unethical and counterproductive to democracy).

The president should only be judged by his policies","text":"When it comes to defeating Donald Trump , his rivals have so far been stymied at every turn.\nDefeating him at the ballot box didn't work.\nBlocking his key goals in Congress hasn't worked. He just signed into law a tax reform bill that also landed a crippling blow to Obamacare through repeal of the individual mandate.\nHoping to remove President Trump from office by way of special counsel Robert Mueller 's eight-month-long Russian collusion investigation hasn't worked. At least it hasn't worked so far.\nSo enter phase four in the anti-Trump movement's efforts to remove, delegitimize, or at least weaken the duly elected president of the United States: They're making the case that he's crazy.\nThat effort got a major boost in recent days thanks to the release of Michael Wolff's new book \"Fire and Fury.\" The book includes several accounts of President Trump's alleged erratic behavior and general lack of fitness for the job.\nThe most damning thing about the book is that Wolff says many of those accusations about the president came from members of the White House staff and even the cabinet. That's unprecedented.\n\"Judging by the intense scrutiny that comes for a candidate and his or her entire family would any fully sane person ever run for President of the United States?\" Indeed, President Trump's public behavior is totally out of sync with what we've seen from every president before him. He's frequently tweeted angrily against members of his own cabinet and Republican Party. Even in live speeches, he's slung around racial slurs, like calling Senator Elizabeth Warren \"Pocahantas.\"\nAnd there was his disastrous comment that there were some \"fine people\" marching among white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia. Beyond his unusual comments and tweets, we also have the massive turnover inside his administration with a record number of positions shuffled through for a first year.\nBut let's take a reality check for a moment. Only a professional psychiatrist who has actually examined a patient can medically deem whether he or she is mentally fit for any job or office.\nYes, the 25 th Amendment to the Constitution allows for the vice president and the cabinet to jointly transfer the powers of the presidency to the vice president, (if the president objects, such a move would also require a two-thirds vote by Congress). But there seems to be no chance of that happening any time soon.\nNo matter how many \"Fire and Fury\" copies are sold and how many news media panels filled with amateur mental health pundits focus on the book's accusations, this is simply another futile path for those obsessed with not accepting the 2016 election results.\nBut as long as the issue of presidential sanity is front-and-center right now, it's not a bad idea to look at what really should serve as the criteria for judging the chief executive's fitness for office. That is, presidential policies.\nIf we look at some of what our past presidents have actually done, the question of presidential sanity should come up often. For example:\nWas it sane for President Obama to release tens of billions of dollars of Iranian money frozen by sanctions back to Iran in return for a promise to not develop nuclear weapons for a decade?\nWas it sane for President George W. Bush to pursue and execute a long war with Iraq instead of conducting a more focused and effective war on radical Islamic terror?\nWas it sane for President George H.W. Bush to support the Kurds in the first Iraq war and then abandon them?\nWas it sane for President Clinton to have a sexual affair with a 22-year old intern right in the White House?\nWas it sane for President Kennedy to support a ragtag bunch of revolutionaries to invade Cuba and then abandon them?\nWas it sane for Presidents Johnson and Nixon to prolong what they knew was an unwinnable war in Vietnam with massive bombing campaigns against North Vietnam and Cambodia?\nFinally, judging by the intense scrutiny that comes for a candidate and his or her entire family would any fully sane person ever run for President of the United States?\nWe can't expect to come to any national agreement on most of the above examples. But at least they would be more productive than debating or pontificating on disputed Quote: s, leaks, and innuendo about any president's personal behavior.\nIt's bad enough that the coverage of every presidential campaign has become dominated by a focus on personality, poll numbers, and all things non-policy related. That's been a major complaint about the presidential election process ever since television played such a big role in John F. Kennedy's 1960 election victory.\nBut now we're seeing coverage of an actual presidency that's focusing mainly on the president's personality. That's dangerous.\nThis is true for both sides of the partisan aisle. For example, the GOP tax bill and its de facto repeal of Obamacare just passed and became law thanks greatly to the Democrats being distracted with non-policy matters like the Russia probe.\nMeanwhile, Republicans who support President Trump's policies are constantly forced to answer questions and criticisms based on his personal behavior. But all this amounts to is an enormous head fake.\nThat's because the hard fact is that President Trump's policies, executive orders, and the bills he's supported are no less sane than any of his predecessors' actual body of work. No matter how unprecedented and salacious the Quote: s in \"Fire and Fury\" are, they don't count as presidential policy. Presidential policy is not only objectively verifiable; it's the only presidential report card that matters.\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

It is now 4 percent away from a record high hit in October 2007.\nParticular focus is on moves by China to allow shareholders of mainland-incorporated firms listed in Hong Kong to release their locked-up shares and trade them in the open equity market .HSCE . Such reforms would boost share supply but could lead to improved corporate governance and valuations, analysts said.\n\u201cIn the first half of this year, the Hang Seng Index will continue to test record highs and will have the chance to rise to 34,000-35,000 points,\u201d said Ben Kwong, chief operating officer at securities firm KGI Asia in Hong Kong.\nHowever, it may fall back to the 30,000-32,000 level in the second half as higher interest rates and an expected stronger U.S. dollar trigger profit-taking, Kwong added.\nMarket watchers expect regulators to be cautious on the pace of H-share reform to avoid the benchmark index - where valuations are still much cheaper than in mainland China - becoming too volatile.\nChina will initially select up to three companies in the H-share convertibility pilot scheme, but investors see the move as a positive step.\nOptimism over the scheme sent the benchmark index past the 30,000-mark to a decade high this week.\nThe convertibility reform is expected to align major shareholders\u2019 interests with other stakeholders, paving the way for greater scrutiny over corporate governance which has dogged many Chinese companies amid a series of scandals.\n\u201cRight now large shareholders\u2019 shares cannot be traded, so the stock price move does not impact them...if their shares can be circulated, they should care about how investors think and then improve corporate governance,\u201d said Victoria Mio, Asia Pacific equities co-head at asset manager Robeco. \u201c2018 will be another bull market for the Hong Kong market.\u201d\nCHINESE DEMAND Southbound fund flows have increased since the stock connect schemes that link Shanghai and Shenzhen to Hong Kong markets were launched in 2014 and 2016, respectively.

He has been relentless in his advocacy for his father and the agenda that has helped turn our country around,\u201d the statement said. \n\u201cI regret that my delay in responding to the inaccurate reporting regarding Don Jr. has diverted attention from the president\u2019s historical accomplishments in the first year of his presidency,\u201d Bannon said. \nUproar over the book has dominated news coverage for days, putting the White House on the defensive just as Trump and his advisers sought to plan and bring attention to their policy goals for 2018 ahead of a November congressional election. \nThe former strategist\u2019s statement could be aimed at trying to secure his job at Breitbart, a platform he has used while backing anti-establishment candidates for election to Congress. \nThe book portrays Trump, a former reality TV star who took office nearly a year ago, as mentally unstable and unfit for the demands of his job.

An employee of Book Culture book store unloads copies of \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\" by author Michael Wolff inside the store in New York, U.S. January 5, 2018.

He should have known they are duplicitous, cunning and not our friends,\u201d Bannon said. \nOn CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday a senior aide to Trump, Stephen Miller, assailed the book, released on Friday, and launched an attack on news coverage before his TV host, Jake Tapper, urged him to calm down and cut off their interview. \nMiller, a senior policy adviser, said the book was a \u201cgrotesque work of fiction\u201d and said it was \u201ctragic and unfortunate\u201d that Bannon made the comments in the book that he did.

FILE PHOTO: Workers walk through the Canary Wharf financial district of London on September 30, 2008. REUTERS\/Alessia Pierdomenico\/File Photo \nThe Payments Services Directive 2 (PSD2), which allows retailers and consumers to bypass banks by authorising payments directly from personal accounts, among other things, aims to cut costs and increase choice by widening the range of firms offering financial services. \nThe European Union rules, which also reflect rapid advances in technology in banking like the use of smart phones, open the door to \u201cfintech\u201d online applications like Money Dashboard, Plum and Moneybox, as well as established retail giants like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. \n\u201cThe development of the market is likely to be a slow burn,\u201d said Karina McTeague, director of retail banking supervision at Britain\u2019s regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\u201cWe, like everyone in this industry, don\u2019t know exactly which direction it will go.\u201d \nIndustry experts said the directive would likely have enormous implications for traditional retail banks. \nAlthough firms with PSD2 licenses will not be authorised to take deposits or make loans, bypassing the banks means debit or credit cards will not be necessary for most of their customers\u2019 online transactions. \nCustomers will also be able to authorise firms to access their accounts to help them manage their finances, for example by guiding them to the cheapest points of credit and consolidating data from accounts with more than one bank, which banks have resisted up until now. \n\u201cPSD2 is a revolutionary piece of regulation that is likely to signal the end of the high street bank in the medium-to-long term,\u201d said Michael McKee, head of financial services regulation at international law firm DLA Piper. \nThe FCA said it has received 40 licence applications for PSD2 services in Britain. As many as a dozen could be in place by Saturday, it said. \nThe directive puts the EU at the forefront of efforts to disrupt the central role of banks in how people pay for goods and services online and encourage competition by giving customers the right to share their account data. \nFintech startups in the United States have argued that a little-known provision in the Dodd-Frank Act gives them the right to source data from their customers\u2019 accounts, but say some banks have been slow to comply. OPEN BANKING \nThe \u201copen banking\u201d system may take a while to gain momentum with the public. \nBritish government efforts to make it easier to switch bank accounts have had limited success due to customer inertia, for example. Another difficulty is convincing customers that their bank account data is safe in the hands of outside firms. \n\u201cIt will be a challenge for all existing banks and payments firms, given their responsibilities to protect information, to properly and promptly handle requests for access to customer data from new open banking portals,\u201d said Tim Dolan, a regulation lawyer at Reed Smith. \nSteve Tigar, CEO of Edinburgh-based personal financial management service Money Dashboard, said the new rules will help their business by establishing trust. \n\u201cUsing a service like Money Dashboard will become commonplace as opposed to the sole domain of early adopters,\u201d he told Reuters. \nThe Bank of England has said direct payment and account services firms could become the future \u201cface\u201d of day-to-day banking, effectively turning traditional retail banks into vaults. \nThat represents a challenge for banks. A BoE stress test of top UK lenders last year said PSD2\u2019s feature of finding the cheapest credit could mean banks will lose revenue from charging for overdrafts, for example. \nIncome from processing payments and overdrafts currently contribute 800 million pounds and 2.6 billion pounds respectively to annual pre-tax profits of the major UK banks, the BoE said. \nThat\u2019s a relatively small amount compared to the 2016 pre-tax profit of 3.2 billion pounds at just one bank, Barclays. But banks may also have to spend more on marketing to attract and retain customers in face of increased competition, the BoE says. \n\u201cI think the days of when you have a big bank and it provides all the touch points to that financial services organisation and provides you with all the product sets, and keeps you captive, are gone,\u201d said Anne Boden, CEO of upstart Starling Bank. \u201cPSD2 could change banking forever.\u201d \nReed Smith\u2019s Dolan said there is nothing to stop banks competing in the same space. HSBC has already said it will launch a new app to aggregate bank accounts. \n\u201cWe are expecting a mixed market to develop here with both small firms challenging and larger players offering these services to their customers for the first time,\u201d said Christopher Woolard, the FCA\u2019s executive director of strategy and competition. \nThe FCA this year is reviewing the business models of retail banks to see if they are sustainable, and will include the impact of PSD2 as an added consideration. \nBritain\u2019s plan to leave the EU next March will not affect the implementation of PSD2 because all of the EU\u2019s financial rules will be incorporated into UK law.

It has again dropped below that critical support level.\nBelow that level lies a new potential support level near 91. This level acted as a rebound point in September and traders will keenly watch to see if it can fill this function again in 2018.\nA successful retest and rebound from 91 creates a double-bottom pattern. That's sometimes called a W pattern. The depth of the pattern is measured and used to set upside targets. The first target is a retest of the peak of the W near 95. This potential target is 99.\nThe potential support level near 91 is not strong. It is not a historical support level and this suggests potential weakness. The strong historical support level is near 93.\nStarting in August of 2017, the dollar oscillated around the 93 value. The lower edge of the oscillation is 91.\nThe upper edge of the oscillation is near 95. If the future rebound from support near 91 fails to move above resistance near 95, then this oscillation pattern will develop into a sideways trading band or consolidation band.\nThe Guppy Multiple Moving Average indicator shows a strong downtrend remains in place. The rally towards 95 was near to the value of the lower edge of the long-term GMMA.\nThe dollar retreated from that strong resistance feature. The long-term GMMA shows no signs of compression and that suggests the downtrend continues to develop strength.\nA change in the downtrend is signaled when the long-term GMMA begins to compress. Any continuation of political instability in the U.S. means the dollar could potentially dip below the lower edge of the trading band near 91.\nThe weekly chart shows there is no strong support or consolidation areas between long-term historical support near 93 and 85. That suggests that any sustained move below the new support area near 91 could quickly fall to 85.

But analysts said it could also send the wrong message about U.S. support for Iran\u2019s people in the middle of the boldest challenge to the leadership in a decade.\nThe sanctions waivers were included in the 2015 nuclear pact with Iran that eased economic pressure on Tehran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.\nTrump has repeatedly criticized the deal and promised to negotiate a better one. Reimposing oil sanctions would essentially kill the agreement.\nReviving sanctions on Iran\u2019s main export would allow Tehran to argue that the United States is ultimately the cause of Iran\u2019s economic problems, said Richard Nephew, who worked on sanctions policy at the White House under President Barack Obama.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say Trump was inclined not to renew the waivers.

Asked whether the protests had changed Trump\u2019s calculation, she replied: \u201cNot necessarily.\u201d\nBLAME THE OUTSIDERS Ray Takeyh, an Iran expert and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Iran\u2019s leaders will blame internal troubles on the United States and other outside powers, no matter what Washington does.\n\u201cThe regime\u2019s argument that the world is against us is a constant for 38 years,\u201d Takeyh said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe optics of waiving sanctions in the midst of all this - it just doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d\nTakeyh and three U.S. officials who follow Iran said the protests undercut Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate who took office in 2013 pledging to improve Iran\u2019s economy, more than they threaten the country\u2019s clerical rulers.\nFormer CIA Director John Brennan, in a Twitter post, said the Trump administration with its condemnation of Iran and the nuclear deal over the last year has squandered an opportunity to bolster reformists in Iran and promote peaceful political change.\n\u201cBluster is neither a strategy nor a mechanism for exercise of U.S. power and influence,\u201d Brennan wrote.\nYet in recent days, Trump and his top aides have charted a more careful course in reacting to the demonstrations, which have led to at least 21 deaths and hundreds of arrests.\nTrump in a Tweet on Tuesday called the Tehran government a \u201cbrutal and corrupt regime.\u201d But he and other U.S. officials have shied away from suggesting Washington seeks the overthrow of Iran\u2019s Islamic theocracy, calling instead for Iranian authorities to respect protesters\u2019 rights.\nState Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert on Tuesday urged Iranian security forces to exercise restraint in dealing with protests and called on Tehran to restore access to social media sites that have been restricted.\nNauert suggested the U.S. government could impose sanctions against Iranian officials who repress peaceful protests.\nAnother U.S. official said a coherent policy response to events in Iran cannot be formulated until Washington has a better understanding of the composition of the protesters, the breadth of the economic and political grievances that are driving them, and what threat they pose to the government.\nThe United States has had no diplomatic presence in Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, limiting its ability to interpret events.\nThe official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington\u2019s main effort now was \u201ctrying to get a sense of who is mostly behind this, how large it is and does it have legs.\u201d\nReporting by Warren Strobel and Arshad Mohammed; additional reporting by John Walcott, Jonathan Landay and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by John Walcott and Grant McCool\n "}

The General Electric engine failed in a way that had never been seen before, causing the fire. The NTSB found that more must be done to differentiate what should be done when there is an engine failure in flight and on the ground. Published 26 Mins Ago Mike Segar | Reuters Robert Sumwalt, National Transportation Safety Board \nFederal investigators said Tuesday that communication problems that left flight attendants unable to talk to the pilots in the moments after an American Airlines plane caught fire on the runway in Chicago in 2016 put evacuating passengers at more risk of serious injury. \nAt a hearing, the National Transportation Safety Board said flight attendants did not know how to use the intercom system to speak with pilots before they directed passengers to use an emergency exit behind an engine that was still running. \nOne passenger was hurt after being knocked down by a blast from the engine after evacuating the plane as he was directed to do by a flight attendant. It was the only serious injury during the incident at O'Hare International Airport. \nThe NTSB also said the investigation concluded the explosion was caused when a turbine disc failed in a way that had never been seen before and shattered. One 57-pound chunk of the disc pierced a fuel line with such force that it was later found more than a half-mile away. \nThe board concluded that the flaw in the disc was not something that was likely to have been seen during an inspection but additional study is needed to determine if ultrasonic inspection methods should be required both during manufacturing and subsequent inspections. \nNTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt seemed to anticipate fear the public might have as result of learning of the cause of the fire. \"The fact is, this is a very, very rare failure,\" he said. \nStill, the fact that an engine exploded into flames as a jet was rolling toward takeoff and the problems with communication in the immediately aftermath of the explosion, Sumwalt suggested that it was very fortunate that only one of the 161 passengers and nine crew members was seriously injured. \n\"American Airlines Flight 383 came too close for comfort,\" he said. \nIn its own statement, American Airlines, while not addressing any issues the NTSB had with the actions of the flight attendants or pilots, said only that the \"manufacturing defect\" in the engine could not have been detected by \"the manufacturer's Federal Aviation Administration-approved inspection requirements.\" \nTexas-based American Airlines issued a statement that highlighted the flaw in the General Electric engine, which it said could not be seen in FAA-required inspections that it conducted. \nThe airline did not address the NTSB's finding that flight attendants were not adequately trained to use the intercom systems on the Boeing 767 during an emergency. \nThe NTSB did credit both the flight attendants for their quick decision to begin the evacuation as the fire sent thick black smoke billowing into the air, as well as the pilots' quick decision to halt the flight before the jet lifted off. But the board suggested the scene was unnecessarily chaotic and that there was not enough coordination between the pilots and the flight attendants both during the evacuation and in the immediate aftermath when, the board found, not enough was done to ensure that everyone was off the jet. \nThe board also found that more must be done to differentiate what should be done when there is an engine failure while the aircraft is in flight and when it is on the ground when \"lives might depend on shutting down\" an engine, said Sumwalt. \nThe NTSB further called out passengers who refused to get off the plane without their carry-on bags as they were instructed by flight attendants, thus slowing down the evacuation and making it more chaotic than it would have been.

But several geopolitical hot spots could keep the run-up in the energy complex alive. \nThe oil market owes much of its gains to OPEC and Russia's deal to limit output this year. International benchmark Brent crude ended the fourth quarter nearly 18 percent higher, near $67 a barrel, while U.S. crude surged nearly 17 percent to more than $60. \nPrices got a boost as tensions flared in the Middle East, Venezuela and parts of Africa, and analysts say continued turmoil could be the key to further gains. \n\"If you want to say, 'How do we break out of this range?' it would be a geopolitical story,\" Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC's \"Worldwide Exchange\" on Friday. \nOil supplies from Iraqi Kurdistan fell after a dispute between the central government in Baghdad and the semi-autonomous region . Concerns about stability in Saudi Arabia following a political crackdown also boosted markets in the fourth quarter. \nIn the final weeks of the year, the threat of a strike by oil workers in Nigeria and a pipeline attack in Libya bolstered a rally underpinned by an outage of U.K. North Seas Forties crude. \nCroft expects the market to soften in the first quarter of 2018 due to seasonally weak demand \u2014 unless one of several first-quarter shocks rears its head. show chapters 3:04 PM ET Fri, 13 Oct 2017 | 00:59 \nPresident Donald Trump could blow up the Iran nuclear deal by restoring sanctions that were suspended in 2016, according to Croft. Trump refused to certify the international accord in October, triggering a 60-day congressional review. \nSince then, Congress has made little progress on a solution to address concerns about the deal. Some fear Trump will refuse to continue suspending sanctions this month, causing the deal to collapse and potentially disrupting Iranian oil supplies. \n\"If he basically says 'I'm not going to waiver sanctions anymore,' those energy sanctions are going to come back,\" Croft said. @realDonaldTrump: The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their \"pockets.\" The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching! \nTrump's foreign policy is also at play in Venezuela, which struggled to make billions in debt payments this fall under the weight of U.S. sanctions. Large payments coming due in the first quarter could trigger the clear-cut default that Venezuela avoided this year and hasten the slow but steady decline in its crude oil output, according to Croft. \nAnalysts are also concerned about growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran , particularly since Iranian-aligned Houthi militants in Yemen have fired missiles toward Riyadh , the Saudi capital. Saudi Arabia and Gulf allies invaded Yemen in 2015 after the Houthis overthrew the government. show chapters 7:18 AM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 | 01:47 \nThe Saudis and the United States have accused Iran of supplying the Houthis with the missiles, with the Saudi-led coalition saying one recent attempted strike could be considered an \"act of war\" by Iran. \n\"We've seen them battling each other on a sort of proxy basis on the edges of the region, in Yemen, in Syria,\" said John Kilduff, founding partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital. \n\"Does that become more direct hostilities next year? Because certainly the rhetoric out of Saudi Arabia has been quite fiery towards Iran,\" he told \"Worldwide Exchange\" on Wednesday. \nKilduff says he's bearish on oil prices, but agrees that geopolitical risks could push up prices, especially since supply and demand have tightened, leaving less of a cushion to prevent price slides. \nOil prices face downward pressure from rising U.S. production, which is approaching all-time highs above 10 million barrels a day. Analysts are also monitoring OPEC and Russia's output deal for signs of cheating on their deal."}

Being sick costs money: 86 percent of the $2.7 trillion spent annually on healthcare comes from individuals with chronic and mental health conditions, the CDC found.\n\"The average person will not always take their medications; they don't follow the protocols,\" said Ron Mastrogiovanni, CEO of HealthyCapital. \"These little things have an impact, and it could be thousands of dollars.\"\nHere's how you can trim your medical bill by keeping your health in check.\nWell-managed care HealthyCapital examined a case study of a 45-year-old man with blood pressure of 150\/95, which means he has hypertension. He forgets to take his medications at times, and doesn't always follow his recommended diet plan .\nThis individual can expect to pay annual out-of-pocket healthcare costs of $2,477 at age 45 if he continues along this path, according to HealthyCapital. (Click on graphics to enlarge.)\nIn all, this patient can expect to spend a total of $138,288 in out-of-pocket expenses before he retires if he doesn't change his ways.\nOn the other hand, if this same individual were to take his medication per his doctor's suggestions, exercise for 30 minutes a day, and slash his fat, salt and alcohol intake, he would spend $1,286 on out-of-pocket healthcare costs at age 45.\nMeanwhile, pre-retirement out-of-pocket expenses would total $72,591 if he dials back his bad behaviors, HealthyCapital found. This adds up to an average annual healthcare savings of $3,285 before he retires.\nIn other words, this hypothetical patient slashes out-of-pocket costs by nearly $90,000 if he keeps up his healthy habits through retirement. The man in the case study also adds three years to his life expectancy due to these changes: He may live to see his 87th birthday.\nBetter health, lower costs Medical expenses fall because a patient who follows directions and manages his condition well will have fewer doctor's visits, require less medication, and need fewer services and procedures, HealthyCapital found.\nThe value of that savings is even larger if a patient invests the money he would have otherwise spent on out-of-pocket costs, and earned a 6 percent return.\nSee below for a snapshot of how much people with other chronic conditions can save if they tighten the reins on disease management.\nThe financial impact of patients' behaviors just might be the best way to nudge them into living healthier lives, said Mastrogiovanni.\n\"It doesn't move the needle if the doctor tells you that you'll feel better and be healthier if you follow protocol,\" he said. \"The number one thing that moves the needle is money.\"\nMore from Personal Finance:\nThis risk can dissolve your retirement savings by $97,000 a year \nHalf of retirees have a nice problem to tackle \nIf you're caring for Mom or Dad, your own retirement is in peril"}

As the group\u2019s presence in the Middle East crumbles, some are returning with family members, while German authorities are trying to secure the release of children whose parents have been detained. \nIn a document addressed to a lawmaker and seen by Reuters on Monday, Interior Ministry State Secretary Emily Haber said it was difficult to estimate the exact number of children set to arrive since it was unclear how many babies were born while their parents were in Iraq or Syria. \nBut security officials had information indicating that \u201ca low three-digit number of minors is expected,\u201d with the majority believed to be babies or toddlers, Haber said in a reply to a formal parliamentary query by Greens lawmaker Irene Mihalic. \nHans-Georg Maassen, head of the BfV domestic intelligence agency, had warned in October that children of returning Islamists could pose a threat after being \u201csocialised and indoctrinated in the battlefield areas.\u201d \nThe radicalisation of children has been in the spotlight given that three of five Islamist attacks in Germany in 2016 were carried out by minors, and a 12-year-old boy was also detained after trying to bomb a Christmas market in Ludwigshafen. \nThe German government says it has evidence that more than 960 people left Germany for Iraq and Syria through November 2017 to fight for the Islamic State jihadist group, of which about a third are believed to have returned to Germany. Another 150 likely died in combat, according to government data. \nState Secretary Haber said there was no evidence of a big increase in the return of people from Iraq and Syria in recent months despite military setbacks for Islamic State. \nThe German foreign ministry was providing consular services to German citizens and their children who had been detained or imprisoned in Iraq, and was seeking the return of children that were now imprisoned with their parents in Iraq, Haber said. \n\u201cNo timeline can be given for the return of these children since this is largely dependent on the cooperation of the Iraqi authorities,\u201d she wrote. \nGiven Germany\u2019s decentralised federal structure, state officials had the main responsibility for deradicalisation of those who returned from Iraq and Syria, including those were convicted and incarcerated, Haber said. \nBut she said the federal government was supporting those efforts through a number of initiatives, including support for families of those who left Germany to fight for Islamic State. \nNew federally-funded programmes were planned in 2018 to educate and deradicalise returning foreign fighters, and the federal government was also funding programmes in each of the 16 states to prevent further radicalisation in prison, Haber said.

(NASDAQ: NUVA), the leader in spine technology innovation, focused on transforming spine surgery with minimally disruptive, procedurally-integrated solutions, announced today the launch of the Company's COALESCE TM Thoracolumbar Interbody Fusion Device as well as FDA 510(k) clearance for expanded indications of its COHERE\u00ae Cervical Interbody Fusion Device. The launch and updated claims follow the NuVasive September 2017 acquisition of Vertera Spine, developers of highly innovative interbody implants for spinal fusion using patented porous polyetheretherketone (PEEK) technology.\nThe NuVasive Advanced Materials Science (AMS) Portfolio includes Porous PEEK\u2122 and Modulus\u00ae Titanium interbody implants that are engineered for enhanced osseointegration and biomechanical properties when compared to solid implants with smooth or rough surfaces. Based on animal studies, COALESCE and COHERE provide a unique three-dimensional Porous PEEK architecture to help elicit and encourage bone ingrowth. The technology used to develop these devices utilizes a proprietary processing method that introduces porous structure without compromising implant strength.\n\"Our strategy in building our AMS portfolio is to provide unprecedented, innovative technologies that enhance the surface, structure and visualization properties of these implants,\" said Gregory T. Lucier, chairman and chief executive officer of NuVasive. \"Our launch of COALESCE and the expanded clearance of COHERE and COALESCE are all part of our continued commitment to bring disruptive technology to market and investment into our comprehensive AMS portfolio, which converge to provide a better surgical experience and improve patient quality of life.\"\nCOALESCE is now commercially available for TLIF and PLIF procedures in multiple footprint, height and lordotic options, and is magnetic resonance compatible. Following its recently cleared 510(k), COALESCE indications have been expanded to include use for one or two adjacent levels in the thoracolumbar spine (T1\u2013 S1) with both autograft and allograft for treatment of degenerative disc disease and degenerative spondylolisthesis as well as multi-level degenerative scoliosis. The device previously received FDA 510(k) clearance for use in anterior, transforaminal, posterior and lateral lumbar interbody fusion procedures.\nThe expanded FDA 510(k) indications for COHERE allow it to be used at multiple levels in the cervical spine (C2 \u2013 T1) with both autograft and allograft. In addition, COHERE received a new ICD code from the Center of Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in October. COHERE is the only product approved for use with the new code, signifying CMS' recognition of the innovation and potential clinical and tracking benefits of using Porous PEEK technology.\n\"Patients can gain significant pain relief and improved functional outcomes through the stabilization and fusion of the degenerated spinal motion segment,\" said Dr. Kenneth Burkus, orthopaedic surgeon at The Hughston Clinic. \"COHERE and COALESCE contribute to these outcomes by retaining the biomechanical properties necessary for intradiscal spinal applications, while helping facilitate osseointegration and bone growth. The use of these new Porous PEEK implants may enhance fusion and limit the risk of stress-shielding, subsidence and implant failure.\"\nAbout NuVasive\nNuVasive, Inc.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 148,000 last month, the Labor Department announced Friday. The weak number was largely due to distress in the retail sector, where jobs fell by 20,300 in their largest drop since March. Yields on the U.S. benchmark 10-year bond, which is considered an indicator of the market's long-term view of the economy, initially fell after the news but stabilized at rates just above Thursday's close. \"The market is shrugging it off because it's not weak enough to detract the Fed from raising rates further,\" said Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Fixed Income Advisors LLC in Minneapolis. \"The modest rise in the average hourly wage number should give the Fed some breathing room.\" Accelerating monthly wage gains pointed to labor market strength that could pave the way for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in March. Average hourly earnings rose 9 cents, or 0.3 percent, in December after gaining 0.1 percent in the prior month. That lifted the annual increase in wages to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent in November. December's payrolls number is further evidence of slowing job growth as the economy approaches full employment. But the $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts signed into law by President Donald Trump last month may boost job growth. The anticipated fiscal stimulus from a reduction of the corporate income tax rate   helped buoy yields. In midmorning trading, the yield on U.S. 10-year government notes was 2.456 percent, up from Thursday's close of 2.453 percent. The yield on two-year notes was little changed at 1.964 percent, just off the nine-year high set on Thursday.

{"published":"2018-01-06T10:40:00.000+02:00","title":"For 2018 training combine firm-specific issues, hot topics","text":"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - The end of the year is often when investment adviser compliance departments plan for representative training for the coming year. Adviser training must reflect the firm\u2019s unique operations and population of representatives, but it must also reflect broader compliance matters in the industry. A training plan that incorporates both firm-specific issues and \u201chot topics\u201d will not only reduce regulatory risk on many fronts but promote a culture of compliance and risk management within the firm.\nFor 2018, these hot topics include cyber security, social media, electronic messaging and disaster recovery. Whether a firm is choosing training topics from a third-party catalog or creating content of its own, such topics should be high on the list for consideration.\nBACKGROUND Broker-dealers have been subject to detailed training requirements for many years. The training requirements for broker-dealers include a firm element and an individual element consisting of continuing education based on the individual securities licenses held.\nInvestment advisory firms do not have a specific firm-element requirement, and even though many investment advisory representatives have qualified to offer advisory services by passing an exam, such as Series 65, a continuing education element does not exist.\nHowever, firms have found training to be the best tool to reduce and mitigate firm risk and set the tone for a firm\u2019s compliance program. A strong tone of compliance is especially important when the Securities and Exchange Commission determines the scope of a firm\u2019s examination and the areas to be reviewed.\nAPPROACH TO TRAINING A chief compliance officer bears a major share of the adviser\u2019s compliance burden. The compliance chief is expected to be competent and knowledgeable, and responsible for administrating the adviser\u2019s compliance program. However, the rest of the staff can be held personally liable for their own compliance violations, in addition to creating liability for their firm. In that sense, CCOs and firm personnel in general need to realize they are in this together.\nTraining should be available not only to employees who may seem to pose less risk to the firm\u2019s compliance, such as receptionists, mailroom personnel, or clerical assistants, but to all personnel, including the most senior executives, whose commitment to compliance training will help to set the tone at the top.\nAdvisers have been using technology as a way to facilitate training. Many firms will use third-party online course materials that will allow the representative to log in and complete the exercise. The software will track completion and create proper records for regulatory examinations. However, small firms may continue to create their own course material or rely strictly on an in-person annual compliance meeting.\nCOMPLIANCE HOT TOPICS A training plan that captures a firm\u2019s definite risks is imperative; however one that also addresses the current regulatory environment and new risks that face advisers is suggested. These current topics can be learned from compliance conferences, professional publications, recent enforcement actions and SEC risk alerts. At a minimum, a firm should review the SEC\u2019s published annual exam priorities to identify those with relevance to the firm.\nUsing regulatory priorities and compliance hot topics in training also exhibits proper dedication to the CCO position. The SEC expects the CCO to be trained and have sufficient knowledge of the rules. An awareness of regulatory priorities and current risks facing the industry in associate training points to a competent CCO.\nTopics to consider for training in 2018 include:\nCYBER SECURITY The online security and protection of client private information has become a primary compliance obligation. Employee training on the topic is imperative. The technology is changing quickly and training must attempt to keep up. A firm must review its own policies concerning current cyber security threats and common mistakes that raise the risk of an attack.\nA firm\u2019s training may cover password protection practices, two-factor authorization, mobile device security, and common avenues that criminals may use to exploit data.\nIn addition, the training must address the actions to undertake, including who to contact, if sensitive information was lost, stolen, or unintentionally disclosed.\nSOCIAL MEDIA The use of social media has become standard not only in personal life but also in business. Training should include the firm\u2019s policies and procedures for social media. An employee must be aware of policies including social media usage and approval guidelines.\nIn addition, the training may cover rules or regulations that can be violated by certain social media posts or actions.\nELECTRONIC MESSAGING A firm must have a policy for the use of text and instant messaging. The practice has become a communications staple for many, and in some cases it can put advisers in regulatory risk if not retained and supervised.\nThe employees of an advisory firm must be aware of what programs can be used and their limitations. For example, the widely used iMessage on Apple devices is encrypted. The encrypted text information makes it virtually impossible to retain and review for compliance purposes. In addition, WhatsApp, an application that allows free cross-platform instant messaging for mobile devices, encrypts and messages and allows senders to delete messages after they have been sent.\nBUSINESS CONTINUITY In 2017, the United States has seen a multitude of natural disasters that can swiftly wipe out a firm\u2019s records and devastate its ability to continue business.\nA firm\u2019s employees must prepare for a disaster as part of the adviser training program. The employees should know how to recover data, access backups, internally communicate, contact third parties and relocate if possible.\nThe training can be specific to the firm\u2019s current plan components but a CCO can also rely on its employees to identify any new risks or ideas for improvement to the business continuity plan during training sessions.\n(Jason Wallace is a senior editor for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.

REUTERS\/Toby Melville \nCurbing immigration was a key reason why Britons voted by 52 percent to 48 percent in the June 2016 referendum to leave the EU, following a large influx of EU citizens into the country, especially from poorer countries in eastern Europe. \nBritain formally exits the EU at midnight on March 29, 2019, but is now preparing to negotiate with the EU the terms of a two-year transition period after that date to help limit the disruption Brexit entails for businesses and citizens. \nThe ambassadors of the other 27 EU states agreed with the executive European Commission on Wednesday that EU citizens\u2019 residence rights should continue after Brexit because Britain will still be bound by all EU laws during the transition phase. \nThe envoys were discussing the details of a new mandate for the Commission, which will negotiate on the EU\u2019s behalf on the transition period and a new trading relationship with the UK. \nA joint EU-UK report published in December said the cut-off date - known as \u201cthe specified date\u201d - for EU citizens\u2019 eligibility to secure UK residence should be March 29, 2019, but it left room for \u201cappropriate adaptation\u201d. \nThe EU envoys endorsed a note to the bloc\u2019s leaders from the Commission that said: \u201cThe specified date should... be defined not as the date of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal, but as that of the end of the transitional period.\u201d \nThe envoys also broadly supported the possibility of extending the transition period beyond two years if - as many expect - more time is needed to negotiate a new free trade agreement with Britain. EXODUS \nDiplomats said the EU position on citizens\u2019 rights was less politically controversial now because immigration was no longer the hot-button issue it was at the time of the referendum. \n\u201cIf anything, today, there\u2019s a big exodus from the UK. Many Poles are leaving. Many British pensioners are leaving for the Spanish sun to become retirees there while they still can. If anything, I\u2019d say the UK has a problem with attracting workers today,\u201d one EU diplomat said. \nBut some Brexit supporters in Britain disagreed. \n\u201cFree movement must end when we leave on 29th March, 2019. Otherwise we will not have taken back control in the way demanded by the referendum result,\u201d said Jacob Rees-Mogg, a British Conservative lawmaker and prominent eurosceptic. \nThe negotiating mandate for the talks on the transition period and a future trade deal are to be finalised by the end of January, with negotiations between Brussels and London to start in March.

Consumer Cramer has already spoken about how the consumer is stronger than many people think. But recently, only do-it-yourself and bargain retailers like Home Depot and Costco were considered to be stable investments by Wall Street.\n\"After this week, it's clear that we're getting terrific results from all kinds of retailers,\" Cramer said. \"The numbers are so big that you have to think there's been a serious pickup in shopping, not just back to where we were in 2014, but, in many cases, to where we were in the early-to-mid-2000s.\"\nStill, Cramer warned investors not to jump the gun. Because the VanEck Vectors Retail ETF is largely in control of the sector, the best strategy would be to wait for it to pull back before buying the improving retail names, he said.\n\"Given that the RTH has been roaring lately, I think you'll end up overpaying if you don't wait for a little bit of a downturn,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"But in truth, retail executives feel that job creation [and] stability, coupled with some genuine economic booms often related to cheap energy in the Southeast, are all combining to create a much more positive backdrop.\"\n2. Millennials Household formation , particularly by millennials starting families, is also having an unexpectedly positive effect on the retail sector, Cramer said.\n\"Millennials [are] finally having children [and] spending money on them,\" he said. \"Maybe student loan debt and health care costs are less of a worry than we thought.\"\n3. Strategy Third, Cramer said traditional retailers' on- and offline strategies are finally starting to resonate with consumers.\n\"While they may have to partner with Amazon Web Services, they're also using the correct customer relationship software to maintain and enhance loyalty,\" he said. \"They have much better control over their inventory and they've finally figured out the positives of bricks-and-mortar, like buy online, pickup at the store .\"\n4. Failures In a time that's been something of a reckoning for retailers, the winners are taking market share as losers abound, Cramer said.\n\"The survivors are getting the spoils,\" the \"Mad Money\" host quipped.\n5. Valuation Finally, the market could still be undervaluing some stocks in the sector, Cramer said, arguing that it seemed \"ridiculous\" that Nordstrom isn't going private given the strength of its latest numbers.\n\"I feel the same way about the stock of Macy's ,\" Cramer said. \"I don't think people understand the magnitude of optionality that Macy's has if they get it right, and CEO Jeff Gennette is getting it very right. The fact that Macy's has cleaned up its balance sheet allows the company to do a lot more with a lot less.\"\nFinal thoughts \"I say now that retail's in a dry spell, and that happens in January, ... you need to buy this group the next time we get any kind of weakness here,\" Cramer concluded. \"The retailers aren't falling apart anymore. For the first time in years, they're not just tradeable, they're actually investable.\"\nWATCH: Cramer renews his retail bull case show chapters Cramer shares 5 reasons why the retail sector is back in action, according to industry executives 19 Hours Ago | 04:41 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

When it comes to vacation, a survey by Project: Time Off found that 54 percent of more than 7,000 American employees ended 2016 with unused vacation time. \nWhile hard work is certainly the key to success, billionaire Richard Branson maintains that there is value in taking time away from the office to unplug and decompress. In a recent blog post , the entrepreneur explains why a three or four day work week can actually be beneficial to the future workforce. Cameron Costa | CNBC Sir Richard Branson. \n\"The idea of working five days a week with two-day weekends and a few weeks of annual holiday is just something people accept,\" he writes. \"For some reason, it is considered set in stone by most companies. There is no reason this can't change. In fact, it would benefit everyone if it did.\" \nBranson says one way to achieve this shorter work week is to look at how technology and innovations can actually improve the workforce by positively impacting our work load. \n\"On the face of it, this sounds like bad news for people,\" he writes. \"However, if governments and businesses are clever, the advance of technology could actually be really positive for people all over the world. It could help accelerate the marketplace to much smarter working practices.\" \nAt his own company, Virgin Management, Branson explains how they've embraced a flexible work schedule where people have options on how, when and where they work. He says with the progression of technology, he believes this flexibility will also become more of a common practice in the future. \n\"Many people out there would love three-day or even four-day weekends,\" he writes. \"There are many people out there who would want to job share, and would love longer holidays. Everyone would welcome more time to spend with their loved ones, more time to get fit and healthy, more time to explore the world.\" Adam Jeffery | CNBC Sir Richard Branson speaking at the Innovation Summit in Brooklyn, New York on July 14, 2017. \nHe adds, \"By working more efficiently, there is no reason why people can't work less hours and be equally \u2013 if not more \u2013 effective.\" \nOne CEO who has already adopted Branson's idea of a shorter workweek is Basecamp CEO Jason Fried . \nDuring the months of May through September, Fried enforces a strict 32-hour workweek where employees work only four days a week. Outside of the summer months, he sticks to a 40-hour work week to ensure that his staff does not experience excessive burnout or become overwhelmed by stress. \n\"People are always surprised by that,\" he tells CNBC Make It , \"and I tell them you can get plenty of stuff done in 32 and 40 hours if you cut out all the stuff that's taking up your time.\" \nWith limited meetings and plenty of room to plan out your own work day, Basecamp's customer support team lead, Chase Clemons, says the shorter workweek has actually helped him to do his best work. \n\"Thirty-two hours forces us to prioritize what we work on,\" says Clemons. \"It's not about working faster, but rather working smarter.\" "}

But the government hopes domestic medicinal use, legalised last year, and exports will rapidly boost production. \n\u201cOur goal is very clear: to give farmers and producers the best shot at being the world\u2019s number one exporter of medicinal cannabis,\u201d Health Minister Greg Hunt told reporters in Melbourne. \nShares in the more than a dozen Australian cannabis producers listed on the local exchange soared after the announcement. \nCann Group ended the day up 35 percent; AusCann Group rose nearly 54 percent; and BOD Australia closed up about 39 percent. All were record highs for those companies. Hydroponics Company finished up 30 percent, hitting its highest price in five weeks. \nPeter Crock, chief executive of Cann Group, which cultivates cannabis for medicinal and research purposes, said medicinal marijuana production had been stymied by limited demand from Australian patients. \n\u201cWhile the Australian patient base is growing, it is very small,\u201d Crock told Reuters. \u201cBeing able to export will allow us to have the scale to increase production.\u201d \nHunt said the new legislation would include a requirement that growers first meet demand from local patients before exporting the remainder of their crop. \nDespite growing demand, only Uruguay, Canada and the Netherlands have so far legalised the export of medicinal marijuana. Israel has said it intends to do so within months. \nThe Australian government\u2019s proposal needs to pass federal parliament when it returns to session in February. The country\u2019s main opposition Labor Party has signalled it would support the move. \nExports would then likely begin within months. \nFuelled by a growing acceptance of the benefits of marijuana to manage chronic pain, moderate the impact of multiple sclerosis and to soften the effects of cancer treatment, several countries and 29 states in the United States have legalised cannabis for medicinal use. \nAustralia\u2019s chief commodity forecaster does not publish data on cannabis production, but rough estimates by the University of Sydney estimated the legal industry at A$100 million ($78 million), well below the C$4 billion ($3.19 billion) that Canada estimates its market to be worth. \nU.S. consultancy company Grand View Research last year forecast the global medicinal cannabis market would be worth $55.8 billion by 2025.

Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 1.9 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.5 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed.\nHigher prices have encouraged U.S. producers to increase their rig count.

Whether this weakness will be short-lived or are we witnessing the precursor to a violent downside correction remains to be seen,\" PVM Oil Associates strategist Stephen Brennock said.\n\"Still, what is apparent is that positives are increasingly in short supply for skittish buyers and the early-year optimism is hanging by a thread.\"\nNot everyone was surprised by the pullback. Analysts told CNBC earlier this month that oil markets were poised for a correction because bullish bets that prices would keep rising have surged, while wagers they would fall have plunged. This means there are plenty of potential sellers, but a shrinking pool of possible buyers.\nSociete Generale commodities strategist Mark Keenan repeated that warning on Friday. While the fundamental supply-demand balance and geopolitical backdrop support the rally, the extreme investor positioning undermines a further run-up , he said.\n\u2014 CNBC's Tom DiChristopher contributed to this report."}

Baker , Heather Somerville 3 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc co-founder Travis Kalanick, who was ousted as chief executive in June, is selling nearly a third of his 10 percent stake in the ride-services company for about $1.4 billion, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday. \nKalanick\u2019s sale is part of a deal struck by a consortium led by SoftBank Group Corp which is taking a 17.5 percent stake in Uber, mostly by buying shares from early investors and employees. SoftBank last week secured agreements from shareholders who were willing to sell, and the deal will close early this year, Uber said. \nThe SoftBank deal values Uber at $48 billion, about a 30 percent discount from its most recent valuation of $68 billion. However, the investor consortium is also making a $1.25 billion investment of fresh funding at the older, higher valuation. \nKalanick had offered to sell half of his total shares, but because there was a limit on how much SoftBank will buy, he will sell just 29 percent, according to the source. Other investors also did not get to unload as many shares as they had hoped because of such widespread interest to sell. \nThe former CEO owns 10 percent of the company, which means his sale will unload 2.9 percent of Uber shares and earn him about $1.4 billion, the source added. Travis Kalanick speaks to students during an interaction at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) campus in Mumbai, January 19, 2016. REUTERS\/Danish Siddiqui\/Files \nA spokesman for Kalanick declined to comment. SoftBank and Uber could not be reached immediately for comment. \nThe sale would make the Uber co-founder a billionaire for the first time, not just on paper. Kalanick has never before sold shares of the company he ran for almost a decade, the source said. \nThe SoftBank deal offers investors and employees what could be their last chance to sell shares in a company-approved transaction before Uber\u2019s long awaited initial public offering, planned for 2019. \nThe transaction marks a victory for new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who helped broker the deal and who will benefit from a deep-pocketed investor like SoftBank. \nBloomberg first reported Kalanick\u2019s plans to sell part of his stake.

The latest accounts from December's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council, released January 11, took investors by surprise as there was a clear hint that the central bank could recalibrate its message to markets in \"early 2018\". SHARES Ralph Orlowski | Reuters European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi addresses a news conference at the ECB headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany July 20, 2017. \nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is slowly moving toward an exit to its massive bond-buying program as the economy is doing far better than expected, and more and more members of its Governing Council seem convinced that extra stimulus should be withdrawn sooner rather than later. \nThe ECB is unlikely to announce a clear timeline for its exit strategy in January, but many now expect it to come in the first six months of the year. \n\"The key thing to watch: Whether Draghi confirms the October statement that there will be no sudden end to QE (quantitative easing),\" Carsten Brzeski, the chief economist of Germany and Austria at ING Diba, said in a research note. \"We expect him to do so as this would be the only way \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 to get the genie back in the bottle.\" The latest accounts from December's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council, released January 11, took investors by surprise as there was a clear hint that the central bank could recalibrate its message to markets in \"early 2018\" \u2013 nothing Mario Draghi had mentioned in the December press conference. The understanding now is that the ECB should gradually shift its stance to avoid a more disruptive move later and should look at a broader revision of its policy guidance to reduce the focus on bond purchases and raise the emphasis on interest rates. \"While many observers have taken the latest account as proof that the more hawkish views are now dominating, also coming against the backdrop of more hawkish comments, it remains unclear whether this would also imply a more aggressive view on policy normalization,\" said Anatoli Annenkov, an ECB watcher at Societe Generale. \"We expect the redrafting of APP (the asset purchase program) forward guidance, softening the link between developments in inflation and asset purchases, to take place at the March meeting.\" show chapters 2:25 AM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 | 01:46 Inflation is still stubbornly low \nThat's also the meeting when the ECB will present new staff projections on economic growth and inflation which might add more meat to the argument to end QE by September. The euro zone economy is now in its best shape for a decade. It is expected to grow on average 2.2 percent this year, according to a Reuters poll. While the economy is doing great, inflation is still stubbornly low with only small signs of a pickup. That's the main reason why the ECB is insisting that its ultra-loose monetary policy stance is appropriate and why a majority of the Governing Council is concerned about an unwanted tightening of financial conditions. \n\"We see two possibilities: The first one is to make the QE easing bias more symmetric, by saying that the ECB stands ready to increase the horizon of the asset purchases if needed, but dropping any reference to a potential increase of their monthly size once again,\" said Daniele Antonucci, senior European economist at Morgan Stanley, in a note. \"A second way, perhaps after this step, is to make the program closed-ended, by no longer saying that it could buy beyond September.\" Who replaces Draghi? \nWhile the messaging is in flux, 2019 will also be a year of major personal changes at the ECB. The terms of Draghi, Chief Economist Peter Praet and Executive Board Member Benoit Coeure are all coming to an end and the debate on who will succeed Draghi at the helm of the institution has started. \"I think the question as to who will succeed (Vice President) Vitor Constancio, who retires in June this year, is most important, because usually the pick of the deputy has an implication for the president's seat as well,\" Martin Lueck, chief investment strategist for Germany, Austria and Eastern Europe, said in an email to CNBC. \"If the Spanish government manages to push through Luis de Guindos for the vice president's job, it could mean that Draghi's post goes to a northern European.\" \nThe decision will be taken by European national leaders. Analysts expect a \"political horse trading\" process that will influence Draghi's succession. This could lead to Germany supporting the Spanish candidate for the deputy position with the understanding that Spain would later support Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann for the top ECB job."}

The Panama-registered tanker Sanchi was sailing from Iran to South Korea when it collided late Saturday with the Hong Kong-registered freighter CF Crystal in the East China Sea. Published 10 Hours Ago SHARES CCTV via AP Video Panama-registered tanker \"Sanchi\" is seen ablaze after a collision with a Hong Kong-registered freighter off China's eastern coast. \nAn Iranian oil tanker that caught fire after colliding with a freighter off China's east coast is at risk of exploding and sinking, Chinese state media reported Monday as authorities from three countries struggled to find its 32 missing crew members and contain oil spewing from the blazing wreck. \nState broadcaster China Central Television, citing Chinese officials, said none of the 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis who have been missing since the collision late Saturday have been found as of 8 a.m. Monday. Meanwhile, search and cleanup efforts have been hampered by fierce fires and poisonous gases that have completely consumed the tanker and surrounding waters, CCTV reported. \nThe Panama-registered tanker Sanchi was sailing from Iran to South Korea when it collided late Saturday with the Hong Kong-registered freighter CF Crystal in the East China Sea, 257 kilometers (160 miles) off the coast of Shanghai, China's Ministry of Transport said. \nChina, South Korea and the U.S. have sent ships and planes to search for Sanchi's crew, all of whom remain missing. The U.S. Navy, which sent a P-8A aircraft from Okinawa, Japan, to aid the search, said late Sunday that none of the missing crew had been found. \nAll 21 crew members of the Crystal, which was carrying grain from the United States to China, were rescued, the Chinese ministry said. The Crystal's crew members were all Chinese nationals. \nIt wasn't immediately clear what caused the collision. \nState-run China Central Television reported Sunday evening that the tanker was still floating and burning, and that oil was visible in the water. Photos distributed by the South Korean government showed the tanker on fire and shrouded in thick black smoke. \nChinese authorities dispatched three ships to clean the oil spill. The size of the oil slick caused by the accident is not known. \nThe Sanchi was carrying 136,000 metric tons (150,000 tons, or nearly 1 million barrels) of condensate, a type of ultra-light oil, according to Chinese authorities. \nBy comparison, the Exxon Valdez was carrying 1.26 million barrels of crude oil when it spilled 260,000 barrels into Prince William Sound off Alaska in 1989. \nThe Sanchi has operated under five different names since it was built in 2008, according the U.N.-run International Maritime Organization. The IMO listed its registered owner as Hong Kong-based Bright Shipping Ltd., on behalf of the National Iranian Tanker Co., a publicly traded company based in Tehran. The National Iranian Tanker Co. describes itself as operating the largest tanker fleet in the Middle East. \nAn official in Iran's Oil Ministry, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters, said 30 of the tanker's 32 crew members were Iranians. \n\"We have no information on their fate,\" he said Sunday. \"We cannot say all of them have died, because rescue teams are there and providing services.\" \nThe official said the tanker was owned by the National Iranian Tanker Co. and had been rented by a South Korean company, Hanwha Total Co. He said the tanker was on its way to South Korea. \nHanwa Total is a 50-50 partnership between the Seoul-based Hanwha Group and the French oil giant Total. Total did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nIt's the second collision for a ship from the National Iranian Tanker Co. in less than a year and a half. In August 2016, one of its tankers collided with a Swiss container ship in the Singapore Strait, damaging both ships but causing no injuries or oil spill."}

(Photo by Drew Angerer\/Getty Images) Drew Angerer\u2014Getty Images By Reuters 9:12 PM EST \nU.S. President Donald Trump said in tweets on Tuesday that the United States may withhold future aid payments to Palestinians, accusing them of being \u201cno longer willing to talk peace\u201d with Israel. \nTrump said that Washington gives Palestinians \u201cHUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don\u2019t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel \u2026 with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?\u201d \nThe President\u2019s tweets follow plans disclosed by his U.N. ambassador earlier on Tuesday to stop funding a United Nations agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees. \n\u201cThe President has basically said he doesn\u2019t want to give any additional funding, or stop funding, until the Palestinians agree to come back to the negotiation table,\u201d Ambassador Nikki Haley told reporters when asked about future U.S. funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees. \nThe U.S. is the largest donor to the agency, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to UNRWA\u2019s website. \nRelations between the Palestinians and Washington soured early last month after Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, generating outrage across the Arab world and concern among Washington\u2019s Western allies. \nWeeks later, more than 120 countries defied Trump and voted in favor of a U.N. General Assembly resolution calling for the United States to drop its stance on Jerusalem\u2019s status. \n\u201cWhat we saw with the resolution was not helpful to the situation,\u201d Haley said on Tuesday. \n\u201cThe Palestinians now have to show to the world that they want to come to the table. As of now, they\u2019re not coming to the table but they asked for aid. We\u2019re not giving the aid, we\u2019re going to make sure that they come to the table and we want to move forward with the peace process,\u201d she said. \nFor more on Nikki Haley, watch Fortune\u2019s video: \nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called the Trump administration\u2019s decision on Jerusalem the \u201cgreatest crime\u201d and a flagrant violation of international law, and said it was unacceptable for the United States to have a role in the Middle East peace process because it was biased in favor of Israel. \nOn Tuesday, the Israeli Parliament passed an amendment that would make it harder for it to cede control over parts of Jerusalem in any peace deal with the Palestinians.

{"published":"2018-01-05T00:44:00.000+02:00","title":"WSFS Announces Actions Related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and Other Year-End Noteworthy Items","text":"WILMINGTON, Del., Jan. 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WSFS Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:WSFS), the parent company of WSFS Bank, today announced a series of actions resulting from the enactment of H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , and other decisions that will impact earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017. These actions include writing down a deferred tax asset, the planned surrender of bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) policies, realizing a fraud loss charge, and a periodic grant to the WSFS Foundation.\n\u201cThe enactment of recent tax reform legislation along with continued strong core performance, positions us to further invest in our business and the communities we serve,\u201d said Mark Turner, Chairman, President and CEO, WSFS Bank. \u201cThese decisions will also enable us to focus our attention in 2018 on key performance metrics and exceeding goals set in our Strategic Plan.\u201d\nThe impacts to earnings described in this release are preliminary estimates and subject to additional procedures which could result in material changes to the preliminary estimated impacts to earnings noted below. These additional procedures could result in material changes to our preliminary estimates during the course of our preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nDeferred Tax Asset Write-Down\nThe enactment of H.R. 1 results in significant changes to the U.S. tax code, including a reduction in the top corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As of September 30, 2017, WSFS had a net deferred tax asset (DTA) totaling $29.4 million. As a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, WSFS is required to revalue its net DTA at December 31, 2017. WSFS estimates the revaluation of its DTA will result in an incremental income tax charge of approximately $12 \u2013 $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company anticipates a negative earnings per share (EPS) impact of approximately $0.37 \u2013 $0.40 resulting from this income tax charge. WSFS expects to recover this charge through lower taxes by the end of the third quarter in 2018.\nSurrender of Bank-Owned Life Insurance\nWSFS periodically reviews its various tax-advantaged investments. In light of the current higher interest rate environment, the lower corporate tax rate, and the tax-equivalized yield on its Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) investments, WSFS will surrender all BOLI policies in 2018, as the returns on such policies are no longer accretive to the Company\u2019s expected high-performance goals for return on assets (ROA). In addition, the decision to surrender the policies was based on ongoing administrative complexity and a reduction in insured interest coverage, as a significant majority of those insured are no longer current Associates. WSFS\u2019 decision to surrender the policies will result in an incremental income tax charge of approximately $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company anticipates an impact on EPS of approximately $0.25 resulting from this income tax charge. The timing to surrender the BOLI policies in conjunction with the new tax rates represents a $3.6 million savings over the prior tax rate environment.\nFraud Loss\nWSFS will record a pre-tax operating expense of approximately $2.8 million from a fraud loss in the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting from a scheme to defraud the bank that was previously disclosed in a current report on Form 8-K on June 22, 2017. The previously viable business loans associated with this relationship became delinquent when the individual decided to immediately wind-down and liquidate the assets of his business due to the significant reductions in revenue that occurred once his indictment was made public. WSFS is pursuing all available remedies, including working with insurance carriers to recoup the loss and believes it has a strong case for recovery in 2018. The Company anticipates an impact on EPS of approximately $0.06 resulting from this pre-tax operating expense.\nGrant to the WSFS Foundation\nAs a community-based organization, and consistent with WSFS\u2019 mission, We Stand For Service , the Company contributed $1.5 million (pre-tax) to the WSFS Foundation in the fourth quarter of 2017. This generational donation matches the only other grant made to the Foundation when it was formed in 2003. The grant will help fund the next generation of improvements in the communities served by WSFS Bank. The WSFS Foundation primarily focuses on educational programs for children in grades K-12 who live in underserved communities and who attend public schools. WSFS Bank anticipates an impact on EPS of approximately $0.03 resulting from this pre-tax expense.\nRecap\nThe actions outlined in this announcement are expected to reduce reported after-tax income by $22.8 \u2013 $23.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, or $0.71 \u2013 $0.74 in EPS.\nWSFS Financial Corporation expects to report fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results on January 22, 2018, followed by a conference call with analysts and investors on January 23, 2018 at 1p.m. EST.\nAbout WSFS Financial Corporation\nWSFS Financial Corporation is a multi-billion dollar financial services company.

A combination of slow sales and the abandonment of some investors following the use of a Remington firearm in the Sandy Hook shooting have left the company in a weak position. Remington's capital structure is currently unsustainable. Published 1 Hour Ago Reuters Joel Page | Reuters A shooter takes aim with a Remington Model 700 SPS Varmint rifle at the Spurwink Rod and Gun Club in Cape Elizabeth, Maine. \nRemington Outdoor Company, one of the largest U.S. makers of firearms, is working with investment bank Lazard on options to restructure its $950 million debt pile, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. \nPrivately held Remington has faced doubts about its ability to refinance its debt next year amid sluggish sales. It was abandoned by some of its investors after one of its Bushmaster rifles was used in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Connecticut in 2012 that killed 20 children and six adults. \n\"We are very concerned that Remington will be unable to refinance debt that comes due in April 2019 given its weak operating performance and high financial leverage,\" Kevin Cassidy, a Moody's Investors Service Inc analyst, wrote in a research note last month. \nRemington is working with Lazard to examine a range of options to boost its finances, and there is no certainty about which course of action the company will choose, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. \nRemington did not respond to a request for comment, while its private equity owner, Cerberus Capital Management LP, and Lazard declined to comment. \nAfter the shooting, Cerberus tried unsuccessfully to sell Remington, then known as Freedom Group, after coming under pressure from some of its private equity fund investors. \nCerberus Chief Executive Stephen Feinberg also considered a bid for Remington to stoke interest in the gunmaker from other potential acquirers, Reuters reported in 2012. In 2015, Cerberus offered a mechanism to its fund investors that wanted to drop Remington, such as the California State Teachers' Retirement System, to sell their stakes back to the company. \nThe families of the victims at Sandy Hook also sued Remington. That case is ongoing. \nRemington's capital structure is currently unsustainable given its weak operating performance, significant volatility in the demand for firearms and ammunition, and high debt load, according to Moody's. \nThe armsmaker's sales have declined in part because of receding fears that guns will become more heavily regulated by the U.S. government, according to credit ratings agencies. President Donald Trump has said he will \"never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms.\" \nThe Madison, North Carolina-based gun manufacturer faces a maturity of an approximately $550 million term loan in 2019. Remington also has $250 million of bonds that come due in 2020, and are trading at a significant discount to their face value at 22 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data, indicating investor concerns about repayment. \nThe term loan maturing next year is also trading at a significant discount to full value, at around 55 cents on the dollar, the sources said. \nPotential reputational risk associated with owning Remington could also complicate the company's negotiations with its creditors, because in a debt restructuring companies often offer equity as an incentive for debt forgiveness, the sources said. Remington's creditors include Franklin Templeton Investments, according to regulatory filings from late last year. They did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nRemington's sales plunged 27 percent in the first nine months of 2017, resulting in a $28 million operating loss. \nColt's Manufacturing Co LLC, a competitor of Remington, emerged from bankruptcy in 2016 following falling sales of its sports rifles and the loss of military contracts.

Updates Guidance for Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2017 Ahead of Presentation at the ICR Conference","text":"VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- lululemon athletica inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) today announced that the Company is updating its net revenue and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ending January 28, 2018.\nFor the fourth quarter, we now anticipate that net revenue will be in the range of $905 million to $915 million based on a total comparable sales increase in the high single digits on a constant dollar basis. This compares to our previous guidance of net revenue in the range of $870 million to $885 million for the fourth quarter based on a total comparable sales increase in the mid-single digits on a constant dollar basis.\nWe also now expect diluted earnings per share will be in the range of $1.24 to $1.26 for the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of the restructuring of our ivivva operations, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.27 for the quarter. The previous diluted earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter was a range of $1.18 to $1.21, or $1.19 to $1.22 excluding the impact of the ivivva restructuring. This guidance does not reflect potential future repurchases of the Company's shares and continues to assume 135.6 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.\nThis guidance also continues to assume a 30.4% tax rate and does not reflect the impact of the U.S. tax reform which was enacted on December 22, 2017. We are assessing the impact that the tax reform will have, but expect to recognize a significant income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 related to the one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings. We believe that the impact of the tax reform will be favorable to the Company's effective tax rate in fiscal 2018.\n\"We are thrilled with our performance this holiday season that reflects an accelerating trend across all parts of our business, and we look forward to continued momentum in 2018 and beyond,\" said Laurent Potdevin, CEO, lululemon.\nManagement will be meeting with analysts and investors and presenting at the ICR Conference in Orlando, Florida on Monday January 8, 2018.

For more information, visit www.lululemon.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nA constant dollar change in total comparable sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures.\nA constant dollar basis assumes the average foreign exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. We provide the constant dollar change in total comparable sales because we use this measure to understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. We believe that disclosing this measure on a constant dollar basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the costs recognized in connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations and its related tax effects. We believe this adjusted financial measure is useful to investors as the adjustments do not directly relate to our ongoing business operations and therefore do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the trend in our operating performance. Furthermore, we do not believe the adjustments are reflective of our expectations of our future operating performance and believe this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because of its comparability to our historical information.\nThe presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or with greater prominence to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the section captioned \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" included in the accompanying financial tables, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as statements regarding our future financial condition or results of operations and our prospects and strategies for future growth.

Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility,\u201d Kim said. \nSouth Korea said it welcomed Kim\u2019s offer to send a delegation to the Pyeongchang Games and hold talks with the South to discuss possible participation. \n\u201cWe have always stated our willingness to talk with North Korea anytime and anywhere if that would help restore inter-Korean relations and lead to peace on the Korean peninsula,\u201d a spokesman for the presidential Blue House said. \n\u201cWe hope the two Koreas will sit down and find a solution to lower tensions and establish peace on the Korean peninsula.\u201d \nLee Hee-beom, president of the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee, said the organisation welcomed North Korean participation. \n\u201cThe (organising committee) will discuss relevant matters with the South Korean government as well as the International Olympic Committee,\u201d he said in a statement. \nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in has said North Korea\u2019s participation will ensure the safety of the Pyeongchang Olympics and proposed last month that Seoul and Washington postpone large military drills that the North denounces as a rehearsal for war until after the Games. \nU.S.-based experts saw Kim\u2019s speech as a clear attempt to divide South Korea from its main ally, the United States, which has led an international campaign to pressure North Korea to give up weapons programs aimed at developing nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States. \nAsked by reporters to comment on Kim\u2019s speech, U.S. President Donald Trump simply said, \u201cwe\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see\u201d, as he walked into New Year\u2019s Eve celebration at Mar-a-Lago, his elite resort in Florida. \nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Kim\u2019s New Year\u2019s address. \n\u201cThis speech pokes at the fissure that has lain below the surface in U.S.-South Korean relations, and seems designed to drive a wedge there,\u201d said Douglas Paal, a former senior U.S. diplomat who heads the Asia program at Washington\u2019s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \n\u201cSeoul\u2019s President Moon needs a successful Olympics and the U.S. drive to increase pressure fits poorly with the Southern agenda.\u201d \nEvans Revere, another former senior U.S. diplomat who has taken part in unofficial talks with North Korean officials this year, said North Korea was likely to try to extract concessions as a \u201cprice\u201d for Olympics participation. \n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Seoul falling for this,\u201d he said, adding that Seoul and Washington had so far stayed in synch in the pressure and isolation campaign. \nRevere said Kim Jong Un\u2019s speech contained the strongest defence of North Korea\u2019s status as a permanently nuclear-armed country he had seen. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un waves to people attending a military parade marking the 105th birth anniversary of country's founding father, Kim Il Sung in Pyongyang, April 15, 2017. REUTERS\/Damir Sagolj \n\u201cImplicit in Kim Jong Un\u2019s speech is a willingness to engage with others, including the United States, on the basis of their acceptance of the \u2018reality\u2019 of North Korea\u2019s permanent nuclear status. That\u2019s not a basis on which the United States is prepared to engage,\u201d he said. \nMoon took office in May last year pledging to engage Pyongyang in dialogue and restore ties strained after nearly a decade of conservative rule in the South. \nBut North Korea has so far snubbed his overtures, including an offer to hold inter-Korean military talks about ceasing hostile activities along the border, as it tested missiles at an unprecedented pace. \nRather than encouraging U.S. measures that \u201cthreaten the security and peace of the Korean peninsula,\u201d Seoul should instead respond to overtures from the North, and \u201cstop nuclear war exercises with foreign forces,\u201d Kim said. \n\u201cREALITY, NOT A THREAT\u201d \nNorth Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September in defiance of international warnings and sanctions, raising fears of a new conflict on the Korean peninsula. FILE PHOTO - A North Korean flag flies on a mast at the Permanent Mission of North Korea in Geneva October 2, 2014. REUTERS\/Denis Balibouse\/File Photo \nAfter North Korea tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in November, which it said was capable of delivering a warhead to anywhere in the United States, Kim declared his nuclear force complete. \nHe continued that theme in his New Year\u2019s address, announcing that North Korea would focus in the coming year on \u201cmass producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment\u201d. \nThis, Kim said, was \u201cirreversible with any force\u201d, making it impossible for the United States to start a war against North Korea. \n\u201cThe whole territory of the U.S. is within the range of our nuclear strike and a nuclear button is always on the desk of my office and this is just a reality, not a threat,\u201d he said, while emphasising that the weapons would only be used if North Korea is threatened. \nKim\u2019s customary New Year\u2019s speech is closely watched for indications of the policy direction the unpredictable and reclusive leader is likely to pursue in the coming year. \nBeyond listing military accomplishments, Kim also outlined economic gains as part of his two-pronged policy of developing his country\u2019s economy and military. \nDespite increased international sanctions imposed over the weapons programme, North Korea made progress in areas like fabrics, shoes and tractors, Kim said. \nWhile Kim is keen to declare his weapons programme a success, he is unlikely to completely end his contentious testing regime, said Scott LaFoy, a ballistic missile analyst at the website NK Pro, which monitors North Korea. \n\u201cI\u2018m still very skeptical of the \u2018complete\u2019 thing they\u2019ve been talking about, if only because we\u2019ve seen so much activity in regards to the submarine launched ballistic mis"}

When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,\u201d Trump said. \nTrump had relied heavily on Bannon, chairman of the right-wing Breitbart News website, for advice in the months leading up to his upset victory in the November 2016 election. \nBannon helped Trump shape a populist, anti-establishment message and has been the president\u2019s link to his conservative base of support. It was not clear if the split would push Bannon to be even more aggressive in his campaign against the Republican establishment and whether he would now also target Trump, or would emerge much weaker. \nAccording to excerpts from \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d by Michael Wolff, to be released on Tuesday, Bannon described a June 2016 meeting with a group of Russians at Trump Tower in New York as \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d The meeting was arranged by the president\u2019s son and attended by top Trump campaign officials. \nTrump has in the past praised Bannon for his friendship, but the president said in his statement on Wednesday Bannon had little to do with his election victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton, calling him \u201ca staffer who worked for me\u201d after he had already won the Republican nomination. \nThe president said Bannon was to blame for the loss of a Republican-held U.S. Senate seat in Alabama in December when Republican Roy Moore, whose campaign was derailed by accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, lost to Democrat Doug Jones. Trump and Bannon backed Moore in the campaign. \n\u201cNow that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn\u2019t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans,\u201d Trump said. \n\u2018NIGHTMARE OF BACKSTABBING, HARASSING\u2019 \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had been upset over Trump\u2019s backing of Moore at the urging of Bannon, was clearly pleased Trump was willing to rid himself of the former aide. McConnell\u2019s campaign organization posted on Twitter an image of the normally taciturn senator with a beaming smile. \nDonald Trump Jr. attacked Bannon in a tweet. \n\u201cSteve had the honour of working in the White House & serving the country. Unfortunately, he squandered that privilege & turned that opportunity into a nightmare of backstabbing, harassing, leaking, lying& undermining the President. Steve is not a strategist, he is an opportunist,\u201d he said. \nThe president, an expert at self-promotion, said Bannon was trying to promote himself by \u201cleaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was.\u201d FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump talks to chief strategist Steve Bannon during a swearing in ceremony for senior staff at the White House in Washington, U.S. January 22, 2017. REUTERS\/Carlos Barria\/File Photo \n\u201cSteve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phoney books,\u201d said Trump, who famously values loyalty in associates and employees. \nLawyers for the president sent a cease and desist letter to Bannon on Wednesday. They said in the letter, seen by Reuters, Bannon had breached an agreement by communicating with Wolff about Trump, his family members and the campaign and made disparaging remarks about Trump and his family. \nWith elections looming in November that could cost Republicans control of Congress, Trump praised Republican lawmakers and candidates, words likely to be welcomed by McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. \n\u201cLike me, they love the United States of America and are helping to finally take our country back and build it up, rather than simply seeking to burn it all down,\u201d Trump said. \n\u2018BRAIN TRUST\u2019 \nAs with much in the Trump White House, the story that triggered the harsh back-and-forth was an offshoot of the investigation into whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russia to sway the election to Trump, allegations Trump and Moscow deny. \nBannon expressed derision about the June 2016 meeting in which a Russian lawyer was said to have offered damaging information about Clinton, according to the book. \nThe meeting was attended by Trump\u2019s son, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Bannon was also quoted as saying he was sure Trump Jr. would have taken the Russians who took part in the meeting to meet his father in Trump Tower. \n\u201cThe three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn\u2019t have any lawyers,\u201d Bannon said in the book in excerpts seen by Reuters. \n\u201cEven if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it\u2019s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately,\u201d he said. \nWhen an intermediary proposed the meeting, saying the Russians were offering damaging information about Clinton, Trump Jr. Responded in an email: \u201cI love it.\u201d \nBannon was incredulous about the meeting shortly after it was revealed, according to the book, concluding sarcastically: \u201cThat\u2019s the brain trust they had.\u201d \nThe Wolff book, parts of which were published by New York magazine, portrayed Trump as shocked that he won the election and said his wife, Melania Trump, was in tears, and \u201cnot of joy.\u201d \nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called the book \u201ctrashy tabloid fiction.\u201d \nThe first lady\u2019s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said: \u201cThe book is clearly going to be sold in the bargain fiction section. Mrs. Trump supported her husband\u2019s decision to run for President and in fact, encouraged him to do so. She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did.\u201d Reporting by Steve Holland; Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu, Jim Oliphant and Brendan O'Brien; Editing by Will Dunham, Peter Cooney and Paul Tait"}

The operation could include a secondary offer of government shares. \nThe bill says the government will have a golden share and that any future private shareholder will have a voting right limited to 10 percent, regardless of the amount of shares it held in the company after the privatization. \nThe sale of Eletrobras will likely be Brazil's largest privatization since mining giant Vale SA was sold by the government 20 years ago. Eletrobras is Brazil's largest power company, holding dozens of subsidiaries with operations in power generation, transmission and distribution. \nNews late on Friday that the government was finally sending the bill to Congress boosted Eletrobras shares, which gained almost 3 percent in Sao Paulo to trade at 20.70 reais ($6.48). \nMost of the guidelines included in the draft bill were already known, since government officials and Eletrobras executives have been discussing the possible model for the privatization for months. \nOne important aspect is that the bill confirmed the government's intention to renew concessions of power generation projects currently held by Eletrobras for another 30 years, likely boosting investors' interest in the operation since they will be assured of future revenues. \nIt also confirmed that the government will keep control of two Eletrobras subsidiaries: Eletronuclear, which manages the country's two nuclear reactors, and the Itaipu hydropower plant, a joint venture with Paraguay's government. \nThere will likely be a long process of evaluation in Congress and the bill could go through a number of changes. \n($1 = 3.1961 reais) (Reporting by Lisandra Paraguassu, Leonardo Goy and Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Daniel Wallis)"}

It's been the go-to response to him from Democrats and even several Republicans who have thought this is a foolproof weapon against him since he first announced his candidacy for president in 2015.\nHow's that working out for them?\nThe fact is the charge of racism doesn't work very well on Trump. But folks keep trying it anyway.\nIt still seems to be the strategy right now in the battle over the budget and the special DACA protections for the children of illegal immigrants. That's how it's playing out after Illinois Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin accused Trump of making the now-infamous \"s---hole\" comment about Haiti and African countries last week. Frantic depictions of those comments as definitive proof of Trump's racism have dominated the news cycle ever since.\nThe goal now seems to be to use this racism-branding tactic in order to shame Trump into bending to the Democrats' will. On Monday, Durbin revealed he's pursuing that shaming strategy, telling the Chicago Sun-Times that, \"if President Trump is not a racist, he can prove it\" by making a deal on the DACA legislation.\nGood luck with that.\nThe reason the shaming strategy is a long shot this time and has failed in the past is because it's nearly impossible to shame or even scare Trump at all. It's even harder to shame him into doing anything.\nLook at the president's tweets and public statements every time he is criticized. Does he ever sound or act like a guy who even considers contrition? Donald Trump is a man who almost never chooses to stay above the fray no matter who is attacking him and how they do it. This was his well-documented behavior before he was a candidate, when he was a candidate, and even as president.\nThe shaming game has its own special hall of shame when it comes to its ineffectiveness. The highlights are:\nIt not only failed to get then-candidate Trump to stop talking about Mexican illegal immigration after his first speech as a candidate, the issue became the hallmark of his campaign. Calling Trump anti-Muslim because of his immigration ban on several predominantly Muslim countries produced only the slightest tweaks to the policy and no real backing down. Legal challenges to the ban have only enraged and hardened Trump's resolve even more as they continue to be upheld by the Supreme Court. Even when racism isn't a factor, shaming Trump doesn't work. The many critics of the GOP tax reform bill found that out the hard way when he continued to push for the bill and eventually got it across the finish line. That was despite the constant depiction of the bill by its opponents as a shameful boon to the rich. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers even said 10,000 people will die per year in America because of the tax bill. That didn't deter the president at all. So, predictably, Trump is responding the opposite way to this latest shaming attempt. He's now toggling back and forth between taking a harder line on immigration policy and insisting he's no racist in his public comments and tweets.\nTrump tweet\nTrump tweet 2\nThat's a far cry from Trump's statement before the \"s---hole\" controversy when he said he'd sign any DACA compromise bipartisan congressional leaders came up with.\nIf the Democrats really are concerned about protecting the so-called \"Dreamer\" immigrants, there's really no excuse for them to be surprised by what's occurred over the last few days. Now, the chances are much greater that the Democrats will have to move to shut down the government when the budget deadline passes on Friday. Worse for them, their bargaining position on behalf of the DACA recipients is weakened now that the focus on the vulgar comments in a closed door meeting has flipped the president from compliant to defiant.\nGovernment shutdowns are a tricky matter. Politicians usually run for the hills at the mere chance that they may be blamed for a shutdown. That's a good thing for people who like government compromise because shutdowns are always the result of a failed budget vote and it takes a 60 votes in the Senate to pass a budget.\nWith that in mind, congressional Republicans began placing a bet that the Democrats wouldn't want to be seen as causing a shutdown over the DACA issue last year. They were right to the point that the Democrats did agree to push off the matter for a month with a temporary spending bill.\nBut now, the Democrats are close to proudly promising to shut the government down over this issue. Yes, polls frequently show clear majorities of Americans support allowing \"Dreamers\" to stay in the U.S. provided they meet certain requirements. But there are also polls that show just as many voters support tougher immigration laws. And most damning of all for Democrats, the overall immigration issue actually remains a relatively low priority for most voters. A Morning Consult\/Politico poll released just two months ago showed that only 29 percent of respondents thought extending the DACA protections should be a priority for Congress.\nBut based on the uproar over Trump's comments alone, the Democrats are willing to play with government shutdown fire.\nSo America's political scene is dominated by two enduring spectacles at the moment. First, we have a president who says politically incorrect and vulgar things with regularity and has no shame or remorse about it. Second, we have the Democratic Party and most of Trump's opponents clinging to and doubling down on a demonstrably failed strategy.\nIt's not clear who \"wins\" in this remarkable exchange. But we do know that the losers are millions of Americans who rely on a functioning government, clear immigration status, and politicians with some grip on reality.\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

REUTERS\/Steve Marcus CES, the showcase for the latest consumer electronics from televisions to self-driving cars, is known for mostly male attendees and female models known as \u2018booth babes\u2019 showing off the new technology.\nIt has attracted criticism for not making itself more welcoming for women or toning down its sexualised atmosphere even as the issue of harassment and assault has grabbed headlines in the last six months and propelled the #MeToo movement into life.\n\u201cThe fact that this large global gathering of tech leaders is totally ignoring this issue makes them completely tone deaf and irresponsible,\u201d said Liliana Aide Monge, chief executive of California coding school Sabio, who is skipping CES for the second year in a row because of the lack of women and minority speakers.\nThe organizers of CES, which opens its doors to nearly 200,000 attendees in Las Vegas on Tuesday, drew criticism last month from executives at Twitter Inc ( TWTR.N ) and other tech companies for a keynote list dominated by white men. CES made a concerted push to diversify its entire speaker lineup, but ultimately failed to find a high-ranking female executive for an individual keynote address.\n\u201cTo keynote at CES, the speaker must head (president\/CEO level) a large entity who has name recognition in the industry,\u201d said Karen Chupka, who oversees the event as senior vice president at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), in a blog post a month ago. \u201cAs upsetting as it is, there is a limited pool when it comes to women in these positions. We feel your pain. It bothers us, too. The tech industry and every industry must do better.\u201d\nOn top of that, CES also will go forward without creating a code of conduct, a mechanism several conferences in technology and other industries have adopted in recent years to set rules for behaviour for attendees, from guidelines on using inclusive language in presentations to requirements that attendees wear name tags at all events, even after hours, to deter misconduct.\n\u201dIt\u2019s sad that CES doesn\u2019t have a code of conduct,\u201d said Y-Vonne Hutchinson, founder of ReadySet, a diversity-focused consulting firm. \u201cThey have a lot of influence. If they\u2019re choosing not to leverage that to promote diversity and inclusion at large, that communicates to the rest of the industry that maybe it isn\u2019t as necessary as we keep saying that it is.\u201d\nHIGH STAKES Evidence of the effect on shows\u2019 safety and tone is mostly anecdotal, but several conferences with these codes, including hacker convention DEF CON, CoreOS Fest and Cloud Foundry Summit, say they have removed attendees after reports of harassment.\nThe stakes are high for the technology industry, rocked in the past year by a sexual harassment scandal at Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and misconduct by some prominent Silicon Valley investors.\nSlideshow (2 Images) The organizers of CES say they expect attendees to heed their own companies\u2019 standards of business conduct and will kick out anyone who behaves poorly, but will not introduce a set of guidelines.\n\u201dWe don\u2019t necessarily have specific rules because we assume everyone will be held accountable to the standards of being in an office,\u201d said Chupka.\n\u201cUnacceptable\u201d behaviour would be addressed by the executive team and legal counsel as necessary, the CTA said. \u201cWe have the right at any time to revoke a show badge and\/or trespass an individual.\u201d CES notes that it has received no reports of sexual harassment at the event in recent years.\nWomen subjected to uncomfortable situations at or near past CES gatherings told Reuters that they did not report incidents because they were too used to it or did not recognise there was a way to do so.\nTo change that thinking, the show is debuting a security app that lets attendees report issues from crimes to broken elevators. While there will be no effort to promote the app specifically as a way to report sexual harassment, attendees may do so, and CES said its lawyers will be ready to act.\nSLUSH CODE The need for a code of conduct became apparent at Finland\u2019s Slush tech startup event in 2016 when multiple women spoke up about being inappropriately touched and receiving unwanted propositions for sex by male attendees as well as being ignored by investors who were only interested in working with male entrepreneurs.\nThe following year, it doubled security, trained staff on how to handle reports of harassment and instituted a code of conduct, including a requirement to wear name badges at all times as a way to make it easier for attendees to identify a harasser.\nA similar approach has been adopted by some in the U.S. tech industry. Salesforce.com Inc\u2019s ( CRM.N ) Dreamforce event, second only to CES in attendee numbers, added a code of conduct in 2014, while film, tech and music conference South by Southwest added one in 2016. Meanwhile, large conferences run by Oracle Corp ( ORCL.N ) and RSA Security have not adopted such a code.\nIt remains to be seen if CES\u2019s lack of a code of conduct will prove costly.\nLas Vegas\u2019 reputation for excess is part of the problem, said Liz Lopez, a tech marketing professional who has attended several industry conferences in the city.\n\u201cPeople are over the edge in their behaviour when they\u2019re in Vegas,\u201d she said.\nEditing By Peter Henderson and Bill Rigby\n "}

Workers cross the Millennium footbridge at dawn with Tower Bridge seen behind in London, Britain, December 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Toby Melville \nTech firms in London attracted 2.45 billion pounds in venture capital funding in 2017, about 80 percent of the 2.99 billion pounds invested in Britain as a whole, according to data compiled by funding database PitchBook for London & Partners. \nEileen Burbidge, partner at Passion Capital, said it was no surprise to see London - and Britain - leading the pack because it has both the talent and investor capital needed. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to our exceptional entrepreneurs that the UK tech sector continues to produce companies that are leading in the development of cutting edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and fintech,\u201d she said. \nFintech, or financial technology, was the most popular segment for investors, attracting a record 1.34 billion pounds in venture capital, the data showed, led by major rounds for TransferWise, Funding Circle and Monzo. \nArtificial intelligence (AI) was another growth area, with UK-based AI firms raising 488 million pounds, double the amount a year earlier, the data showed. \nOther big deals last year included a 391 million pound investment into Improbable, whose software creates large-scale simulations in the cloud; 364 million pounds for food delivery company Deliveroo; and 255 million pounds for mobile phone firm Truphone. \nBurbidge said the biggest threat to Britain\u2019s leadership was any restrictions in its ability to attract the best talent after the country leaves the European Union next year. \n\u201cAccess to talent is critically important,\u201d she said. \n\u201cBeing able to attract EU talent has been a huge advantage for the UK in the last few years.

They also added 2 1\/2 years to his sentence, condemning him to 12 years in prison. Lula, Brazil's first working-class leader, so far remains free pending future appeals. \nLula, 72, could now be ineligible to stand for election under Brazil's \"Ficha Limpa\" or \"Clean Record\" law, which bans political candidates whose convictions have been upheld by an appellate court. However, an electoral court must make the final ruling on a candidacy, and would only do so once a candidate had registered. \nLula can appeal Wednesday's decision by the appeals court in Porto Alegre to higher courts to delay a final ruling, possibly avoiding jail and stringing the process out long enough to register his candidacy by the Aug. 15 deadline. \nLula's Workers Party called the ruling a \"farce\" orchestrated by Lula's enemies to stop him returning to power. The party said it would resist the decision and push ahead with its plan to launch him as presidential candidate. \nA handful of supporters protested the court decision on Wednesday evening, setting fire to tires in downtown Porto Alegre and across a major highway in Sao Paulo, South America's largest city. \nOpponents of Lula, meanwhile, celebrated on Sao Paulo's main avenue with a giant blown-up figure of the ex-president dressed as a prison convict. \nLula is one of scores of powerful politicians and businessmen caught up in sweeping corruption probes that have wracked the Brazilian establishment since 2014. \nHis exclusion from the October election would radically alter the political landscape ahead of a campaign in which Lula is the early favorite, with 36 percent of voter preferences according to pollster Datafolha. That is double the percentage of his nearest rival, the far-right congressman and former army captain Jair Bolsonaro, who has been energized by anti-Lula sentiment. \nBrazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index hit a new intraday high of 83,635 points on news of the unanimous ruling against Lula. It closed 3.32 percent higher on investor expectations his exclusion from the 2018 race will clear the way for a more market-friendly candidate who can stick to Brazil's austerity agenda. \nBrazil's currency, the real, firmed 3 percent against the U.S. dollar, leading gains in Latin America. \n\"The ruling takes off the table the worst possible scenario for the market, the biggest downside possible in terms of the election,\" said Roberto Campos, a partner at Sao Paulo-based Absolute Investimentos. \"The guy who was completely not market-friendly is out.\" \nMORE CASES \nLula faces six more indictments in corruption cases ranging from receiving bribes from engineering firm Odebrecht to obstructing justice and trafficking his influence to obtain government decisions favoring the auto industry. \nHe is among over 100 people convicted in the \"Car Wash\" investigation, the most sprawling of Brazil's numerous probes. It focuses on graft involving oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro, known as Petrobras, and other state-run companies. \nSpeaking at a union rally on the outskirts of Sao Paulo on Wednesday, Lula told the crowd: \"I committed no crime.\" \n\"The only fair decision today would be a 3-0 ruling that I was wrongly convicted and sentenced,\" he said. \nLula was convicted of corruption and money laundering last year for accepting a beachside apartment from an engineering firm vying for contracts with Petrobras. \nProsecutors said the apartment and its refurbishing was a bribe worth 3.7 million reais ($1.1 million). Lula maintains he never owned the penthouse apartment, criticizing prosecutors for what Lula's lawyers called a reliance on the plea bargain testimony of one witness, businessman Leo Pinheiro. \n\"His word is not enough to incriminate Lula,\" Lula's lawyer Cristiano Zanin told the appeals court. \n(Reporting by Lisandra Paraguassu in Porto Alegre, Writing and additional reporting by Anthony Boadle in Brasilia, Additional reporting by Bruno Federowski in Brasilia and Pablo Garcia in Sao Bernardo do Campo; Editing by Andrew Hay and Rosalba O'Brien)"}

The costs of owning the ETF may exceed the cost of investing directly in the underlying securities.\nMLP Interest Rates: As yield-based investments, MLPs carry interest rate risk and may underperform in rising interest rate environments. Additionally, when investors have heightened fears about the economy, the risk spread between MLPs and competing investment options can widen, which may have an adverse effect on the stock price of MLPs.

That's down $44 billion from Larsen's paper worth of $59.9 billion on Jan. 4, when XRP hit a record high of $3.84. Bitcoin's drop also means that twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss no longer hold the equivalent of more than $1 billion of the digital currency. Source: YouTube Chris Larsen, co-founder of Ripple. \nThe digital currency plunge has wiped billions from the paper fortune of a cryptocurrency billionaire in just a few weeks. \nRipple's XRP coin has fallen 74 percent from an all-time high of $3.84 hit on Jan. 4, erasing $44 billion from the holdings of Chris Larsen, co-founder and executive chairman of Ripple. \nWith XRP trading near $1 Wednesday, Larsen now holds the equivalent of just $15.8 billion, according to CNBC calculations using figures from Forbes. Citing sources at Ripple, Forbes said earlier this month that Larsen has 5.19 billion of XRP and a 17 percent stake in the start-up. Ripple holds 61.3 billion of the 100 billion XRP coins in existence. \nAt XRP's peak on Jan. 4, Larsen was worth $59.9 billion. That made him one of the five richest people in the U.S. and wealthier than Google's founders , based on Forbes' rich list. \nA Ripple spokesperson had nothing to add at the time, and did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment Wednesday. \nRipple 12-month performance \nSource: CoinMarketCap \nMajor digital currencies have plunged in the last two days after reports raised concerns about increased regulation on cryptocurrencies in South Korea and China. Last week, XRP prices also appeared to fall after CoinMarketCap said it was excluding prices from certain Korean exchanges due to significant price differences with other markets. \nOn Wednesday, bitcoin dropped below $10,000 on CoinDesk for the first time since late November. Ethereum was close to 18 percent lower near $865, after falling through the $1,000 level Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap. \nWith bitcoin trading near $9,870 on Wednesday, twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss' possible holdings of the digital currency have fallen to around $904 million. The brothers had a combined worth of more than $1 billion in bitcoin as the digital currency surged in December. The calculations are based on a report the brothers had $11 million in bitcoin at $120 a coin in April 2013. \nA representative for the twins did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. The brothers may have sold or bought bitcoin since April 2013. \nJanuary's price rout hardly dents cryptocurrencies' massive gains in 2017. Bitcoin soared about 1,500 percent, while XRP shot up more than 35,500 percent. \nThe losses may have knocked Ripple's Larsen from the five wealthiest people in America. But at $15.9 billion he still beats 32nd place Rupert Murdoch, who has a net worth of $15.4 billion according to Forbes."}

And after the launch of Amazon Go this week, Bezos tacked on another $2.8 billion to his net worth. But there's another story that's not getting as much attention.\nTen percent of Amazon 's Ohio workforce is on food stamps, according to a snapshot study done by a nonprofit liberal-leaning policy research group called Policy Matters Ohio. And it was released just days before Bezos ' net worth broke the world record at $105 billion .\nThe report looked at data from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. It found that roughly 700 employees, more than 1 in 10, at Amazon's Ohio warehouses received SNAP benefits in August.\nSNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, helps qualifying families purchase groceries through what's commonly known as \"food stamps.\"\nAnd it turns out, these Amazon employees relying on food assistance cannot even shop at the company's new cashier-free store, Amazon Go, the company has confirmed to CNBC.\nThat's raised further questions about Amazon's demographic priorities. Back in December, Piper Jaffray found that more than 80 percent of the richest U.S. households use Prime, Amazon's paid membership program. Though the company did seem to be making an effort to court a lower-income customer base.

A man exercises in downtown Los Angeles, California, March 9, 2015. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson \nResearchers reviewed 11,530 studies of so-called mild cognitive impairment (MCI), to see how many older people are affected and which interventions and lifestyle changes have been shown to improve symptoms. \nMCI becomes increasingly common at older ages and is characterized by mild problems with thinking and memory that usually don\u2019t interfere with daily life or independent function. People diagnosed with MCI are more likely, however, to go on to develop Alzheimer\u2019s or other dementias than people without it. \nUntil now, said Ronald Petersen, the lead author of the new study and American Academy of Neurology (AAN) treatment guidelines, \u201cClinicians didn\u2019t know what to do with these people. Now that we know that it\u2019s a burgeoning condition we need to pay attention when folks come in and complain.\u201d \nPetersen, who directs the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center in Rochester, Minnesota, and his coauthors found that between ages 60 and 64, 6.7 percent of people have MCI. In the 65-69 age group, that rises to 8.4 percent, and about 10 percent at ages 70-74, nearly 15 percent at 75-79 and just over 25 percent at ages 80 to 84. \nWhen they looked at the use of drugs, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, they found \u201cno high-quality evidence\u201d that the medications work, according to the report in the journal Neurology. \nTheir analysis of studies looking at the effects of physical exercise on cognition did find a benefit, though. In one study involving 86 women with MCI, 70 to 80 years old, researchers found that twice-weekly resistance training for 26 weeks was more effective than aerobic training over the same time period at increasing what\u2019s known as executive functioning. After completing the exercise regimen, the women were better able to plan, manage and organize their thoughts. \nBased on their review, the authors updated a practice guideline for MCI to include, for the first time, a recommendation that people with the syndrome should exercise regularly as part of an overall approach to managing their symptoms. \n\u201cThis is a rich area of study. I don\u2019t think you can say that if you exercise 150 minutes a week you can push back cognitive decline a certain number of years,\u201d Petersen said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that for sure, but . . . physical exercise might be beneficial in slowing down the rate of cognitive decline since it has been shown to cause some stabilization or improvement of cognition.\u201d \nHe thinks a combination of aerobic exercise and resistance training is likely best for MCI patients, but the data about its long-term effectiveness remains \u201cscant.\u201d He recommends that patients with MCI try to work up a sweat by walking briskly for 50 minutes, three times a week, because it might improve blood flow to the brain or induce enzymes to break down proteins that can build up into brain plaques. \nNeurology researchers are hoping to develop more specific evidence-based guidelines on how much exercise and what kind is needed to potentially delay or prevent cognitive decline based on ongoing clinical trials, he noted. \nThe new AAN guideline, which is endorsed by the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, also urges clinicians to discuss with their MCI patients the diagnosis, prognosis, long-term planning and the lack of evidence that drugs and dietary options, such as vitamins E and C, homocysteine-lowering B vitamins and flavonoid-containing drinks, are at all effective. \nPetersen and his colleagues also analyzed five studies of brain-training interventions and found \u201cinsufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any individual cognitive intervention strategy.\u201d Nevertheless, they conclude that doctors may recommend this approach because it might improve specific cognitive skills. \n\u201cContinuing to be cognitively and physically active is paramount for overall brain health,\u201d noted Dr. Neelum T. Aggarwal of the Rush Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Center in Chicago, who wasn\u2019t involved in the review or guidelines. \nSome cases of MCI are associated with reversible causes of cognitive impairment, including medication side effects, sleep apnea, depression and other medical conditions, so it\u2019s important for patients to visit their healthcare provider at the first sign of memory problems, he said in a phone interview. \nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2BV4fVp Neurology, online December 27, 2017."}

I am incredibly excited to have Dale on board, particularly at this pivotal juncture in Actinium\u2019s progression and am confident that under his leadership the Company will have significant accomplishments related to its research efforts and further development of the AWE Technology Platform. Clearly our industry leading CD33 Program is a testimony to the power of the AWE technology platform and the ability of ARC\u2019s to be effective where antibody-arming approaches using toxins have less potential, as evidenced by our initiatives with Actimab-M and Actimab-MDS. Dr. Ludwig is well suited to drive future efforts to utilize the power of the AWE technology for both the Company and collaborators. It is exciting to continue to strengthen the leadership team at Actinium. With each successive hire our capabilities become amplified which enables us to better drive toward the expected clinical milestones related to the Iomab-B, Actimab-A, Actimab-M and Actimab-MDS programs as well as our AWE platform, and to unlock the value inherent in Actinium.\u201d\nAbout Our Actinium Warhead Enabling Technology Platform\nThe Actinium Warhead Enabling (AWE) Technology Platform enables a highly potent and selective form of targeted therapy that combines the powerful alpha-emitting radioisotope actinium-225 with targeting agents which are designed to seek out cancer cells in the body that express particular markers. Actinium-225 emits significant alpha radiation making it a potent treatment modality against targeted cancer cells while limiting damage to healthy tissues as its radiation travels extremely short distances in the body. When labeled to targeting agents, actinium-225 can be delivered directly to cancer cells where the high linear energy transfer resulting from the emission of alpha particles results in irreparable DNA double stranded breaks and ultimately cancer cell death. Despite this superior cell killing power, actinium-225 when delivered in a targeted manner is sparing of the surrounding environment in the body due to the short path length of its alpha-particle radiation and can result in a superior safety profile. Actinium Pharmaceuticals owns or has licensed the rights to several issued and pending patents that pertain to its AWE Technology Platform including technology to manufacture actinium-225 in a cyclotron. In addition, the Company has developed considerable know-how, expertise and validated processes related to production of Antibody Radio-Conjugates or ARC\u2019s, management of the supply chain, and dealing with various regulatory bodies. The AWE Technology Platform can be utilized to potentially improve the cell-killing power of targeting agents such as antibodies, peptides, Fab fragments, nanobodies etc. via labeling with actinium-225. In addition to increased efficacy, these actinium-225 enhanced targeting agents can offer optimized dosing or administration and in the case of approved targeting agents provide an opportunity to extend intellectual property protection by the creation of biobetters or improved versions of the approved agent. The Company\u2019s Actinium Warhead Enabling (AWE) Program can be accessed by biopharmaceutical companies that are interested in creating biobetters through the utilization of the AWE Platform Technology.

The Ford Motor Company logo is pictured at the Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S., November 30, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake \nFord\u2019s plans challenge the ambitions of ride services companies like Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and highlight how automakers and those with roots in the tech industry are forging separate paths to build businesses enabled by self-driving cars. \nWhile Ford has a partnership with ride-hailing company Lyft, the automaker is focusing on moving goods itself for businesses large and small, Jim Farley, president of global markets, and Sherif Marakby, Ford\u2019s head of autonomous and electric vehicle development told Reuters in an interview. \n\u201cWe\u2019re testing the business model\u201d for goods delivery, Farley said. Ford expects to expand delivery partners beyond Dominos Pizza and San Francisco-based Postmates, Farley said. The automaker sees small businesses as a significant potential market and a natural next step after decades of catering to commercial van and pickup buyers, he said. \nFord has not named the city where it will begin testing its approach. \nFord intends to power its self-driving cars with plug-in hybrid systems that rely on petroleum-fueled engines to extend driving range and power the electronics needed for automated driving, Farley and Marakby said. \nBut top California clean air regulator Mary Nichols had tweeted her objection to that plan last month. \n\u201cEarth to Ford: what part of sustainability do you not understand?\u201d Nichols had tweeted. \u201cDriverless hybrid vehicles running 24\/7 delivering pizza and passengers means more tons of pollution\/GHGs in cities!\u201d \nMarakby and Farley said the power demands from computers and sensors can cut the range of an all-electric self-driving car by half. Ford does not plan to use full electric systems until the second generation of its self-driving vehicles, Marakby said. \nGeneral Motors Co has trained its resources on developing self-driving, all-electric vehicles for use as taxis in big cities.

And Amazon has found a way to tap that market though small companies like Vuzix, which has a market capitalization of just about $186 million.\nVuzix's is one of many augmented-reality products expected out of CES, a Las Vegas consumer electronics trade show happening next week.(Augmented reality is where computerized images are projected on top of a live video image from the real world, while its cousin virtual reality completely embeds the user in a 360-degree computer-generated world.)\nDepending on their quality, availability, and price, these products could haunt Apple , which has planned its own smart speaker, and is reportedly working on augmented reality glasses. But with Siri's HomePod debut delayed, Alexa seems to be stepping into the augmented reality market.\nWhy Vuzix believes the time is ripe for AR glasses Vuzix has a long-standing presence as a wearables maker in the enterprise technology market, working with companies like DHL, Airbus and Bosch. But CEO Paul Travers said that he's bullish enough on the impact of new augmented reality technologies that he plans to take Vuzix glasses to consumer markets early in the second quarter of this year. \n\"Our opinion is that if you make something that solves a problem, there's a market for it,\" he said.\nHe said that from the early 2000s, clients had requested \"Oakley-style\" smart glasses, but until recently, it was just hard to package fast processing power into a small hardware package like glasses frames. But coming technologies, particularly 5G internet connectivity and faster processors, will allow more communication between the \"edge\" of the device and the cloud, enabling advanced technologies like artificial intelligence to appear on small, thin screens. \nTravers said that Microsoft , Google and Apple are still the only widespread platforms for developers to make augmented reality products. But, he said, limiting them to phone apps much longer, as Apple has so far done, could limit their appeal. \n\"How many people are going to hold the phone up? It's unnatural,\" he said. \nStill, Travers said, his views on augmented reality are aligned with those of Apple CEO Tim Cook, who has said that augmented reality, rather than virtual reality, will prevail as a future computing platform. He said that many experimental uses of VR, like Magic Leap, seem more like \"science projects,\" and that his company is prioritizing real-world applications over animating creatures to jump around the field of view. \nHe compared virtual reality to a PDA \u2014 a self-contained device \u2014 while augmented reality was connected to the world, like an iPhone.\n\"I believe what Apple does \u2014 AR changes everything\" he said. \"VR is head in a bucket stuff ... Most people are sweating after an hour. It's got issues. Technical hurdles. But with a conventional pair of glasses \u2014 just regular glasses -- information comes up, and just stays up in front of you AR allows you to be in the real world, and there's so much more you can do.\""}

The administration is structuring the plan in hopes of encouraging more than $1 trillion in state, local and private financing to build and repair the nation's bridges, highways, waterworks and other infrastructure.\nThe total investment that could be generated could reach as much as $1.85 trillion, a White House official said, depending on how much private investment is leveraged.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobbying group in Washington, is even backing a 25 cent increase in the federal gasoline tax to make that happen.\nIt is unusual for a business group to call for a tax increase, but the Chamber argues that it is necessary to fund critical infrastructure projects.\n\"Its time to invest in a 21st century infrastructure, a system of infrastructures to support and grow a 21st century economy,\" said Tom Donohue, the Chamber's president, in a speech on Thursday as part of the organizations renewed public push for action.\n\"Its time to make up for decades of underinvestment that today is evident in everything from bone-rattling potholes and endless traffic gridlock, to deadly train derailments and destructive water main breaks,\" he said.\nThe numbers in the Trump plan are still in flux and could change before he unveils it. The prospects of winning approval in Congress are uncertain given that Republicans have only a 51-49 majority in the Senate.\nMany Republicans want to use private-sector investment to finance infrastructure projects to avoid increasing the national debt. Democrats believe that government money is necessary to produce such a large package.\nCost-sharing Under the Trump plan being shaped, the largest share of the federal money \u2014 $100 billion \u2014 is expected to go toward cost-sharing projects with local governments, similar to grants, a senior administration official said.\nThe goal would be to reduce the ratio of federal funding, which often now is 80 percent, by awarding funds only to projects that are able to provide more local funding or leverage private investment, said a business lobbyist familiar with the discussion.\nSome $50 billion would be earmarked for rural projects, the lobbyist and an administration official said. Those funds would help governors on projects like roads, broadband access and replacing aging lead pipes. Including a pool for rural infrastructure could also reduce concerns among some Republican senators who fear rural areas may be unable to attract private investments.\nTwenty-five billion dollars would go toward existing federal infrastructure loan programs that seek to spur private investment, the lobbyist said.\nThe final $25 billion would be designated for so-called transformative projects \u2014 an effort being dubbed \"American Spirit\" projects. They could include high-speed trains or the Gateway Tunnel, the stalled proposal to build a new rail connection between New York City and New Jersey. The smallest two funding levels could shift slightly in the final proposal, the administration official said.\nThe plan may not deliver any additional federal money than in years past. The proposal could take $200 billion from existing spending plans although the administration has not yet committed to whether it would come from existing programs or whether the money would be found elsewhere. The White House is expected to unveil its budget proposal next month.\nThe administration is unlikely to rule out any forms of funding \u2014 including increasing the federal gas tax or creating a vehicle mileage tax, which would put battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric cars that now use the roads but do not consume much gasoline on the same footing as cars with internal combustion engines, sources said.\nDonohue made four recommendations for the infrastructure package including raising the gas tax and also recommended expanding the ability of states to access private investment funds to complete projects, reducing the federal permitting process and addressing state and local permitting rules.\nHe also called for more federally backed workforce training \u2014 including more apprenticeship programs.

This divestiture is expected to yield annualized cost savings of $1.4 million per year. This action is in addition to steps taken in August 2017 to reduce and align the Protonex cost base. Together, these actions are expected to yield annualized cost savings of $2.6 million, better positioning Protonex to deliver future profitability.\nThe Protonex business had three businesses: Power Manager, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's), and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC). In 2017 Ballard conducted a strategic review of each of these business activities to determine the most effective strategic course for each business.\nPower Manager:\nThe Power Manager business has underperformed against expectations, primarily due to unexpected delays in achieving a certain procurement milestone in the U.S. Army's Program of Record. Ballard initially expected to achieve this milestone in 2016; however, the milestone was not achieved until September 2017. This Program of Record includes a number of new devices focused on improving power and energy management on and around the soldier, including Protonex' Squad Power Manager Kit (SPM-622), conformal wearable batteries, and man-worn power and data distribution devices, such as the Protonex Vest Power Manager family. As a result of this milestone, which enables full rate production status, Ballard now expects growth in the Power Manager business beginning in 2018.\nUAV:\nProtonex has made significant progress in the UAV business, both in the military market and the commercial market, including key business planning, field trials and business development activities. Ballard plans to re-brand the commercial UAV business with the Ballard brand under the leadership of Phil Robinson, previously Vice President, Defense Power Systems at Protonex, who was appointed as Vice President, UAV.\nSOFC:\nWith respect to the SOFC business, Protonex had been engaged in certain product development and commercialization programs for small-scale SOFC stationary power products. In 2017 it was determined that these assets were not core to Ballard's proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell business, and the company decided to divest these non-core assets. As a result, certain SOFC assets were transferred to a private, start-up company, Upstart Power Inc., effective December 31, 2017, for nominal consideration. Initially, 10 Protonex employees have moved to Upstart Power Inc., with an additional 6 employees expected to be transferred later this year on completion of certain Technology Solutions contracts. As part of this transfer of employees, Dr. Paul Osenar, previously President of Protonex, has moved to Upstart Power Inc. as CEO. This action has enabled Ballard to significantly reduce the cost structure at Protonex. Ballard has no ownership interest or liabilities associated with Upstart Power Inc.\nWith Dr. Osenar's departure, Dave Long, previously Vice President, Electronics and Systems at Protonex, has been appointed interim General Manager at Protonex.\nAbout Ballard Power Systems\nBallard Power Systems (NASDAQ: BLDP; TSX: BLDP) provides clean energy products that reduce customer costs and risks, and helps customers solve difficult technical and business challenges in their fuel cell programs.

AMD -3.75% suggested its chips were largely unaffected by significant vulnerabilities found in a variety of processors, the rival to Intel Corp. INTC -2.50% has run into trouble. \nMicrosoft Corp. on Tuesday said some customers found their AMD-powered computers were unusable after applying the latest security patches for the Windows operating system.\nOn an online support page, Microsoft said it would \u201ctemporarily pause \u201d sending updates to some devices running AMD processors. After investigating, the software giant said it found \u201csome AMD chipsets do not conform to the documentation previously provided to Microsoft.\u201d \nIntel\u2019s shares sank in the two days after the chip vulnerabilities were disclosed last week, while AMD shares are up more than 15% since Jan. 2, the day before news of the security flaws was widely disclosed. An AMD spokesman at the time said the flaws posed a \u201cnear-zero risk\u201d to its processors. Its shares were down 3.5% in afternoon trading Tuesday.\nThe patch issue affects \u201ca small subset of older processors that were sold prior to 2009,\u201d an AMD spokesman said Tuesday.\nAMD and security researchers say the company\u2019s chips aren\u2019t vulnerable to the most easily exploitable\u2014but most easily patched\u2014variant of the security flaws, known as Meltdown.\nInstead, the problem that is being patched by Microsoft concerns a variant of another flaw, known as Spectre. It is likely to be an increasingly important security problem in the months to come, as researchers learn more about the issue, said Paul Kocher, an independent security researcher, who was among those who discovered the Spectre vulnerabilities.\n\u201cOnce the Meltdown patches are installed, I don\u2019t see any significant security difference between Intel and AMD on these issues,\u201d he said.\nAMD should have done a better job documenting how software makers should develop patches for the chip maker\u2019s hardware and more clearly explained the security issues associated with their products, Mr. Kocher said. Rivals Intel and ARM Holdings have offered much more detailed documentation of these security issues, he said.\n\u201cMicrosoft has access to our processor architecture documentation, which is essentially what is needed, and we have been engaged regularly in engineering meetings to assist since this was disclosed,\u201d the AMD spokesman said.\nGlitches are possible any time a software update is deployed. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time a Windows update had an issue,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cBut it\u2019s obviously not a positive thing.\u201d\nWrite to Robert McMillan at Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com and Ted Greenwald at Ted.Greenwald@wsj.com"}

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency that regulates the development and dredging of wetlands, has published the completed permit application from the Pebble Limited Partnership on its website.\nThe application will trigger a formal environmental review of the plan to build an open-pit mine in a region with the world's biggest sockeye salmon runs.\nThe proposal to build the mine is moving forward under President Donald Trump, a champion of increased domestic mining, after the Environmental Protection Agency under former President Barack Obama attempted to put the region off limits to large-scale metals mining in 2014.\nBackers of the project say it could create 2,000 construction jobs and 850 jobs during operations.\nThe Pebble Limited Partnership, comprising Canadian miners Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd and First Quantum Minerals Ltd, expects the full review to take three to five years, said spokesman Mike Heatwole.\nThe mine would extract minerals from a huge deposit of copper, gold and molybdenum and operate for 20 years, according to the Pebble Partnership.\nThe Pebble Limited Partnership is planning to mine 1.2 billion tons of material, including 287 million pounds of copper.\nEnvironmentalists, commercial and sport fishermen, many Alaska Native tribal organizations and even some Republican politicians have all criticized the project, which would be built on land near Lake Clark National Park.\nThey argue the mine, which would be located upstream of Bristol Bay and its large salmon runs, would spoil important fish and wildlife habitat. Public opinion polls have consistently found the mine is strongly opposed by Alaska residents.\nIndigenous communities in particular have criticized the project, though some groups have supported it.\n\"The science on such a project is already available, and already clear: this mine will devastate the Bristol Bay fishery,\" Robert Heyano, president of the United Tribes of Bristol Bay, said in a statement.\nPebble Limited Partnership Chief Executive Officer Tom Collier, in a statement Friday, said the company has responded to critics by scaling back the mine scope, eliminating planned use of cyanide and making other changes.\n\"These are very substantial improvements that we have made over the past few years in response to issues and concerns raised by project stakeholders,\" he said.
