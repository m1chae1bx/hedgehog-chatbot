FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks during an 'Unleashing American Energy' event at the Department of Energy in Washington, U.S., June 29, 2017. REUTERS\/Carlos Barria\/File Photo \nDays after explosive comments by Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, left the White House on the defensive, the president will sit down at Camp David with party leaders, including House of Representative Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \nTrump achieved the first major legislative win of his presidency in December with tax legislation long sought by his party and its supporters. \nThe president is eager for more victories and the White House has targeted infrastructure policy and an overhaul of entitlement programs as its top priorities. Immigration legislation, in particular a plan to help people who were brought to the United States illegally as children, is also on the agenda. \nWhile Trump and McConnell want to work on infrastructure first, Ryan is more interested in tackling entitlement programs such as welfare. \nA White House official said the timing of legislation would be discussed as well as the political priority of giving Republicans substantive issues to highlight ahead of November elections when the party will battle to keep control of Congress. \nAll 435 members in the House and one-third of the 100 members in the Senate will be up for re-election. A Democratic takeover of one or both chambers could help stifle Trump\u2019s agenda. \nThe meeting at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, which will also include Cabinet officials, follows an uproar over the description in a new book of an inept Trump White House. In the book, Bannon also suggested the president\u2019s son and son-in-law committed treason by meeting with a Russian official during the 2016 campaign. \nTrump broke with Bannon on Wednesday, saying his former adviser had \u201clost his mind\u201d after the comments attributed to Bannon in Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d were made public. \n\u2018COMPLETE FANTASY\u2019 \nThe strategy session will provide an opportunity to switch topics after the furore over the book, which goes on sale on Friday. \n\u201cThe White House doesn\u2019t mind the optics after a few days of the president unloading on Bannon and making our views clear on the book. The president sits down and charts the course forward ... with the actual leaders of the Republican Party,\u201d a White House official said. \nTrump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Thursday that Wolff\u2019s book was a \u201ccomplete fantasy\u201d filled with tabloid gossip. \u201cThis is a guy who made up a lot of stories to try to sell books,\u201d she said in an interview with Fox News Channel on Friday, referring to Wolff. \nSanders also called for the conservative online outlet Breitbart News to consider parting ways with Bannon, who leads the group and had pledged to campaign for anti-establishment Republican candidates in the 2018 elections. \nSenate Republican Whip John Cornyn said the weekend meeting would help lawmakers and administration officials get on the same page about their priorities. \n\u201cThis administration came into office perhaps not really knowing for sure that they would win the election, and was a little bit behind the curve in terms of preparing. Now I think they\u2019ve recognised that that sort of coordination is really important in order to get things done,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday. \n\u201dSo I look forward to having those conversations and making sure that the president\u2019s priorities and our priorities are aligned.\u201d Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell, Steve Holland and Susan Heavey; Editing by Peter Cooney and Jeffrey Benkoe"}

Baker 6 Min Read \nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A wave of cyber attacks by criminals, spies and hacker activists should make these heady days for U.S. cyber security startups. \nInstead, many in the crowded market are struggling to live up to their early promise. In some cases, the security products they developed have been overtaken by advances in cyber hacking, according to industry executives and venture capitalists. In others, larger competitors have come out with similar technology and locked down customers. \n\u201cI have never seen such a fast-growing market with so many companies on the losing side,\u201d said David Cowan, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, a venture capital firm that has invested in the cyber security sector. \nVenture capital continues to pour into the industry, driven by the belief that there is no end in sight to cyber attacks or companies' need to protect themselves. Yet only a handful of startups have successfully sold themselves or floated in the stock market in recent years. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2mzClbR ) \nThe result is a number of these start-ups have become corporate \u201czombies\u201d with little prospect of fetching a good price in an initial public offering (IPO) or becoming acquisition targets, experts said. Their early investors have been left without an easy or profitable exit. \nNot only is the technology behind cyber attacks rapidly evolving, the nature of how the corporate world uses security firms is changing. To save money and trouble, some companies have consolidated their security work, using just a few large players rather than spreading business around. \nCompanies are also diverting money to lower-cost \u201cbug bounty\u201d firms that contract out researchers who help identify security weaknesses. \n\u201cSuddenly, we are in this situation where there are just too many vendors and too few can be sustained,\u201d said Dave DeWalt, the former CEO of cyber security company FireEye Inc ( FEYE.O ). \n\u201cYou\u2019re starting to see companies go, \u2018oh my gosh, what do I do? Can I get more capital, do I have to merge?'\u201d DeWalt said. \nMomentum Cyber, an advisory firm focused on cyber industry mergers and acquisitions, said it tracks 2,500 security companies today, almost double the number a few years ago. The firm\u2019s co-founder, Eric McAlpine, estimates 300 cyber security startups launch every year. \nFew of these are pulling off IPOs. What\u2019s more, big software companies have become less willing to acquire cyber security products they believe they can develop on their own. \n\u201cThe pipe dream days of selling companies at a rich price equivalent to ten times their revenue are gone,\u201d said Tom Kellermann, chief executive of venture capital firm Strategic Cyber Ventures. \nForeScout Technologies Inc ( FSCT.O ), a provider of software that helps companies keep the devices of their employees secure, was the only U.S. cyber security company, excluding identity management providers, to go public last year. This compares to three cyber security IPOs in 2016 and four in 2015. FILE PHOTO: A man types on a computer keyboard in this illustration picture taken February 28, 2013. REUTERS\/Kacper Pempel\/Illustration\/File Photo \nForeScout raised $116 million in an IPO in October that valued the company at about $800 million, down from its $1 billion valuation in the private markets a year earlier. ForeScout\u2019s backers, including Intel Capital and Accel Partners, had to moderate their valuation expectations for the IPO to be successful. The company is now trading at a $1.2 billion market capitalization. \nZombie capital: Cyber security venture capital funding on the rise while exits fall: tmsnrt.rs\/2mzClbR HOLDING BACK \nTo be sure, many venture capital firms are sticking with the sector. Some are curbing their bets or backing smaller startups. \n\u201cStartups that are likely to reach between $100 million and $300 million in value are still offering excellent opportunities for an exit,\u201d said Yoav Leitersdorf, whose investment firm YL Ventures was an investor in Hexadite, a cyber security incident investigation company that announced a sale to Microsoft last June. \nSome larger startups, such as Carbon Black, have delayed their IPOs. Founded in 2002 by former U.S. government cyber security experts, Carbon Black, formerly known as Bit9, was a pioneer in developing tools that detect and respond to threats targeting corporate networks. \nWithin a few years, its market became more competitive, as rivals such as Cylance, CrowdStrike, and SentinelOne came out with similar technologies. Some larger companies, including Symantec Corp ( SYMC.O ), also developed similar products. \nCarbon Black filed confidentially for an IPO in 2016, while also exploring a sale to other companies, including IBM Corp ( IBM.N ), people familiar with the matter said. IBM did not respond to a request for comment. \nThe Boston-area company has yet to move ahead with the IPO, stranding investments from venture capital backers such as Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital. Both firms declined to comment. \nA source close to Carbon Black said it is now hoping to go public this year, and that it delayed its IPO to integrate an $100 million acquisition of a company called Confer. \nCarbon Black CEO Patrick Morley, in an interview, declined to comment on plans around a possible IPO, or any merger discussions. \nBut Morley said the company has rolled out several cyber security offerings that make it more diversified than its rivals. He also predicted more consolidation in the market. \nAnother startup, Zscaler, which specializes in cloud security, hired investment banks to go public last year but has delayed its offering until at least March to focus on growing its revenue, according to sources. Zscaler declined to comment. \n\u201cSome have compared some cyber security companies to cockroaches,\u201d DeWalt said. \u201cThey can\u2019t die, but they aren\u2019t smoking hot either.\u201d Reporting by Liana B.

The website said the central bank made the initial ruling, which could be appealed, in November.\nCEFC, a privately held Chinese group focused on energy and other investments abroad, has spearheaded Chinese investments in the Czech Republic, backed by political support from Czech and Chinese presidents.\nIt took an initial small stake in JTFG, a banking and investment group operating in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Barbados and Croatia, in 2015.\nOther regulators including the European Central Bank have approved the increase of its holding via an acquisition from JTFG founders, Slovak businessmen Ivan Jakabovic and Josef Tkac.\nWebsite www.echo24.cz Quote: d what it said was the central bank decision as saying the regulator lacked sufficient information on the origin of most of the funding for the deal, or 728 million euros ($874.91 million) out of a deal value of 980.6 million euros.\n\u201cThe Czech Republic\u2019s clearance will be the last required for the deal to be closed, and CEFC actually paid around 300 million euros last year (to the sellers),\u201d a CEFC executive with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nThe executive added that the company has secured the rest of the funding from Chinese banks and expected the deal to be closed soon. He did not elaborate further.\nCEFC said in a statement on its website on Wednesday it was seeking Czech central bank approval of the deal and believed it had supplied all necessary documents by the end of 2017, but was ready to provide more information if required.\nIt did not directly confirm the central bank had made an initial negative decision, and a spokesman declined further comment.\nA spokeswoman for the Czech central bank declined to comment.

I\u2019m going spend it rallying Americans behind our vision \u2014 a just, inclusive, prosperous America.\u201d \n\u201cMy fight is in removing Donald Trump from office and from power,\u201d Steyer added, his comments coming amid rumblings that he would pursue a political bid of his own. \u201cAnd that starts with taking the House back.\u201d \nThe money, he said, would be used in elections across ten states: Arizona, California, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. Several of those stand to factor mightily during the 2020 election. \nSteyer also said that he would continue to \u201credouble\u201d his efforts to promote the impeachment of President Donald Trump. Late last year, Steyer spent millions of dollars to run an ad arguing for Trump\u2019s impeachment, and started a petition that has garnered over 4 million signatures. Trump, in turn, called Steyer \u201cwacky and totally unhinged.\u201d \nSteyer did not specify how much money he would be putting in the new campaign. He did, however, explain that he would expand this effort to include political activism beyond the steps he has already taken\u2014like giving complementary copies of \u201c Fire and Fury,\u201d journalist Michael Wolff\u2019s explosive account of the internal workings of the Trump administration, to various members of Congress. \nWhile Steyer definitively ruled out a political candidacy in 2018, he left the door open for future possibilities. When asked about the 2020 elections\u2014and who he could support\u2014he declined to look beyond the immediate horizon of the midterm elections. \u201cWe are all in for November 6, 2018,\u201dhe said. \u201cWe feel as if this is a must-win situation for us, and we are not focused on anything starting on November 7, 2018.\u201d SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

Reconsidering Amazon AWS.\" \nWininger later followed up, saying Amazon's poaching of employees from customers, like Lemonade, is a \"breach of confidence.\" He also added the \"obscene amount of money\" being offered to steal his employees could end up damaging the entire Israeli start-up market. \nIn a separate Facebook post , Wininger wrote, \"Game on! Werner Vogels FYI,\" tagging Vogels, Amazon's chief technology officer. \nWininger's complaint is the latest evidence of the growing tension between Amazon and emerging tech companies. Last year, Amazon irked some start-ups after releasing a product that looked and worked almost the same as a device made by Nucleus , one of its Alexa Fund portfolio companies. It could also cripple Amazon's effort to expand its presence in Israel, a start-up powerhouse with some of the world's best technical talent. \nAs Wininger's posts gained traction, Vogels eventually left a comment underneath it, indicating he doesn't support Amazon's poaching from its customers. \n\"Let me dive into this,\" Vogels wrote in the comments section of the Facebook post. \"It may be a sourcing agency vs Amazon proper. I find that sourcing from our customers would be extremely counter-effective.\" Talent war \nAmir Konigsberg, CEO of the Tel Aviv-based start-up Twiggle, said the problem isn't necessarily about Amazon stealing start-up employees, but rather the aggressive nature of its poaching. \nHe pointed out that Amazon has been \"systematically\" reaching out to groups of employees working on specific projects within start-ups, putting them at risk of losing an entire team at once. Konigsberg, who formerly led Google's expansion in Israel, said Amazon is much more aggressive than other multinational companies, like Google or Facebook. \n\"Talent war is fine but you have to remain respectful,\" Konigsberg said, adding Amazon is hurting its relationship with the rest of the Israeli tech community. \"It's very important to keep an equilibrium with how you operate. Apple, Google, and FB all have lots of money, but you haven't seen these kinds of complaints happening about them.\" show chapters 6:31 PM ET Tue, 29 Aug 2017 | 00:58 \nThe bigger problem for Amazon is that it may be hurting itself. \nIn the comments section under Wininger's post, a number of Israeli start-up CEOs said they're considering other cloud vendors because of Amazon's actions. That would add to the flood of companies avoiding AWS, a group that includes a number of big-box retailers like Walmart, Target , and Kroger. \nAmazon did not respond to requests for comment. \n\"We spend nearly $2,000,000 \/ year on AWS, yet Amazon recruiters are aggressively trying to poach our developers in TLV,\" wrote Liad Agmon, CEO of Tel Aviv-based Dynamic Yield. \"It's a data point I'm seriously considering as part of our internal debate whether to stick with Amazon or switch to Google cloud.\" \nGiven Amazon's massive share in the cloud space, it's hard to imagine this will have a material impact on AWS. But it's at least opening the doors for competitors to reach out with better offers, as one Google Cloud salesperson did on LinkedIn. \n\"Google Cloud would love to have you \u2014 shoot me a message,\" the Google representative wrote under Wininger's post.

North Korea has not responded to Lee\u2019s proposals.\nNorth Korea participated in the international multi-sports events hosted by South Korea three times - in 2002, 2003 and 2014.\nThe North boycotted the Seoul Olympics held in 1988. Nine months before those Games, North Korean agents detonated a bomb on Korean Air Flight 858, killing all 104 passengers and 11 crew.\n2002 ASIAN GAMES, BUSAN (Sept 29-Oct 14)\nNorth Korea sent a 606-member delegation, including 184 athletes, 288 cheerleaders and 134 officers to the 2002 Asian Games in the South Korean port city of Busan.\nAthletes from the two Koreas paraded together at the opening and closing ceremonies, a spectacle not seen since the 2007 Asian Winter Games in China as relations chilled under nearly a decade of conservative rule in the South.\nThe contingent traveled to the via North Korean flights and a cruise ship, using the vessel as their accommodation.\nThe female cheerleaders proved a huge attraction in South Korea with their good looks and tightly choreographed gymnastic routines, and became a feature of subsequent events in 2004 and 2005. Ri Sol Ju, now North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s wife, came to South Korea in 2005 as a North Korean cheerleader for the Asian Athletics Championships in Incheon, a lawmaker previously told reporters after being briefed by intelligence officials.\n2003 SUMMER UNIVERSIADE, DAEGU (Aug 21-Aug 31)\nA combined 528 North Koreans, including 303 cheerleaders and 94 athletes, attended the Games. The two Koreas marched together at the ceremonies.\nNorth Korean athletes flew into South Korea and stayed at Daegu Bank Institute, a training facility for the local bank.\n2014 ASIAN GAMES, INCHEON (Sept 19-Oct 4)\nPyongyang sent a total of 273 North Korean athletes and officials to the Games. They stayed at the athletes\u2019 village.\nBut Pyongyang dropped its plan to send a cheerleading squad amid deteriorating inter-Korean relations under the previous Park Geun-hye administration. Ahead of the Games, the North also threatened to pull out of the event, accusing the South of plotting to block its athletes from taking part.\nThe two Koreas did not march together at the ceremonies.\nThe North sent its most senior delegation ever to attend its closing ceremony with just 24 hours\u2019 notice. Kim allowed three of his top aides to fly aboard his personal jet to attend the event, while the athletes, who arrived in five installments including from Japan and Switzerland, took regular commercial flights of North Korea\u2019s Air Koryo.\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Haejin Choi in SEOUL; Additional reporting by Hyonhee Shin; Editing by Soyoung Kim and Lincoln Feast\n "}

BP logo is seen at a fuel station of British oil company BP in St. Petersburg, October 18, 2012. REUTERS\/Alexander Demianchuk\/Files \nBP\u2019s rival Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) said last week it would incur a one-off charge of $2-$2.5 billion for the U.S. tax changes. \nLike BP, Shell and many other international companies said they expected a long-term positive impact to U.S. earnings from the massive $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law last month. It cuts the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals as well. \nBut BP said that in the short term, lower tax rates will affect its deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulting in a one-off, non-cash charge of $1.5 billion to its 2017 fourth quarter results which are due to be announced on Feb. 8. \n\u201cThe ultimate impact of the change in the U.S. corporate income tax rate is subject to a number of complex provisions in the legislation which BP is reviewing,\u201d BP said in a statement. \nThe British company\u2019s shares closed down about 1 percent on Tuesday. \nThe adjustment will not affect BP\u2019s cash flow in the fourth quarter. \nExxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ), the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil producer, declined to comment on how the U.S. tax changes would financially affect it. \nChevron Corp ( CVX.N ) said it was studying the changes but still plans to invest $8 billion in the United States this year. \nDeferred tax assets refer in some cases to a company overpaying taxes in advance and then getting them back in the form of tax relief. \nBP has large operations in oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore shale operations as well as refineries that can process up to 746,000 barrels per day of crude oil, according to its website. \nOn Dec. 22, Trump signed the tax overhaul into law, cutting tax rates for businesses and offering some temporary cuts for some individuals and families.

He was found guilty by a jury in October of violating federal truth in lending and racketeering laws. \nTucker did not make a statement at his sentencing, referring instead to a letter he submitted to the court in December. In that letter, Tucker said he was \u201cremorseful\u201d for \u201cthe misperception that I do not recognize my responsibility to live as a good and fair business man, employer, and American citizen.\u201d \nCastel said the letter showed Tucker had not accepted that his conduct was criminal. \n\u201cThe notion that Mr. Tucker is just an honest businessman doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d he said. \nTucker\u2019s lawyer, Lee Ginsburg, said he would appeal. \nCastel also sentenced Timothy Muir, 46, a lawyer who worked with Tucker and was convicted of the same charges in October, to seven years in prison. Muir\u2019s lawyer, Thomas Bath, could not immediately be reached for comment. \nTucker and Muir were indicted in February 2016 amid efforts by the federal government to crack down on abuses by payday lending companies. \nSuch companies say they help consumers by offering small loans that are to be repaid in a short time, often from the person\u2019s next paycheck, but critics say they exploit borrowers through high interest rates and fees. \nProsecutors said Tucker\u2019s Kansas-based business, which operated under names including Ameriloan and OneClickCash, routinely charged interest rates as high as 700 percent, exploiting more than 4 million people from 1997 to 2013. \nAfter several states brought lawsuits over the lending, prosecutors said, Tucker entered into sham relationships with Native American tribes. By claiming his companies were owned by tribes, prosecutors said, Tucker was able to shield the companies from lawsuits using tribal sovereign immunity. \nTucker, who has competed on U.S. and European racing circuits, was previously convicted of making a false statement to obtain a bank loan and of running a fraudulent financial services business. He was sentenced in 1991 to a year in a federal prison for the latter crime. \nTucker was also charged in Kansas last month with filing a false tax return. That case remains pending.

While some patients may use short-acting inhalers to quickly relieve occasional shortness of breath, people with more severe and persistent symptoms may be prescribed long-acting inhalers to help expand the airways and keep them open.\nCompared to COPD patients who didn\u2019t use long-acting bronchodilators, those who did were 50 percent more likely have cardiovascular problems like a heart attack or stroke within the first 30 days of starting to use these inhalers, the study found.\nThe absolute risk of problems like stroke, heart attack, rhythm disorders, and heart failure was still very low \u2013 around 1 percent \u2013 and the increased risk associated with long-acting bronchodilators disappeared over time, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\u201cPatients should know that their risk for cardiovascular diseases will be increased after initiation of bronchodilators even though the treatment is essential,\u201d said Dr. Tadahiro Goto, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\nWhile patients shouldn\u2019t stop using inhalers, they should be vigilant about seeking medical attention for symptoms that might indicate a heart problem, such as chest pains or a suddenly rapid heart beat, Goto said by email.\nTo assess the connection between long-acting bronchodilators and heart problems, researchers examined data on 284,220 adults with COPD who had never used these medicines.\nAt the start of the study, patients were 71 years old on average, and researchers followed them for an average of 2 years. During that time, 37,719 people developed severe heart problems requiring emergency medical care.\nResearchers looked at long-acting bronchodilators in two different families of medicines \u2013 beta-agonists and antimuscarinic antagonists \u2013 and didn\u2019t see a difference in the risk of heart disease based on the type of drug or the dose.\nThe study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how long-acting bronchodilators might influence the odds of severe heart problems in patients with COPD.\nWhile these medicines are designed to widen the airways, they may also accelerate the heart rate, constrict blood vessels and increase blood pressure, said lead study author Meng-Ting Wang, of the National Defense Medical Center in Taipei, Taiwan.\nLong-acting bronchodilators might also increase inflammation, which then leads to blockage of the blood vessels, Wang said by email.\nIt\u2019s also possible that heart problems that appear linked to the medications in the study might have been there all along and misdiagnosed in some patients, said Dr. Shawn Aaron, a researcher at the University of Ottawa Medical School who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\nPatients should have a follow-up exam after they start using these inhalers to make sure they\u2019re not having symptoms that might be caused by cardiovascular disease, Aaron advised.\n\u201cNo one should avoid these drugs if they are prescribed by a physician,\u201d said Dr. Prescott Woodruff, a researcher at the University of California San Francisco who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\u201cThey are very effective at improving lung function and reducing exacerbations in COPD,\u201d Woodruff said by email. \u201cThe initiation of these drugs, in this instance, can simply be a marker for worsening symptoms of COPD or cardiovascular disease that is mistaken for COPD.\u201d\nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2A6F4NM JAMA Internal Medicine, online January 2, 2018.\n "}

Ali Rabiei, Iran\u2019s minister of cooperatives, labour and social welfare, said the government had plans to create over 900,000 jobs by March 2019, the state news agency IRNA reported on Friday. \nThe authorities have produced no evidence of a U.S. role in the demonstrations, which have lacked a unifying leader. GUARDS QUELLED UNREST \nBut in Moscow, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Iran\u2019s statements that external influences fomented the unrest were not groundless and that Washington used any possible method to destabilise governments it disliked. \nHe added that U.S. calls for an extraordinary meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss the turmoil in Iran interfered with the country\u2019s sovereignty, news agency Interfax said. The Council will meet on Friday at 3 p.m. (2000 GMT) to discuss Iran, Council president Kazakhstan has said. \nResidents contacted by Reuters in various cities said the protests had shown sign of abating since Thursday, after the establishment intensified a crackdown on the protesters by dispatching Revolutionary Guards forces to several provinces. \nIran\u2019s elite Guards and its affiliated Basij militia suppressed the country\u2019s 2009 unrest over alleged election fraud, in which dozens of pro-reform Iranians were killed. \nIranian officials said the protests were the result of foreign instigation and mocked   Trump\u2019s support of protesters against what he called a \u201cbrutal and corrupt\u201d establishment. \n\u201cEternal bedfellows #KSA (Saudi Arabia) and #ISIS (Islamic State) - following Trump\u2019s lead - all endorse violence, death and destruction in Iran. Why are we not surprised?\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on Friday. \nLast year Islamic State (IS) militants carried out their first attack in Tehran, killing 18 people in a country that backed offensives against the group in Syria and Iraq. \nOn Friday rallies, protesters chanted \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel\u201d, carrying pictures of Iran\u2019s top authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and waved Iranian flags. \nTelevision footage of rallies in several cities showed people chanting \u201cWe support Imam Khamenei ... We will not leave him alone in his fight against enemies\u201d. \n\u201cDemonstrators demand the punishment of those behind foreign-linked riots which insulted religion and our authorities,\u201d state television reported, referring to unrest in which social media footage showed protesters tearing down pictures of Khamenei. UNITED FRONT \nHardline Khatami said the government should take more notice of Iranians\u2019 economic problems. \n\u201cThere are workers who say they have not received their salaries for months ... These problems should be resolved,\u201d Khatami said, according to state TV. \nFearing that further unrest could undermine the Islamic republic altogether, Iran\u2019s faction-ridden political elite has displayed a united front. \nBut Khamenei and his hardline allies have criticised Rouhani for failing to revive the economy after most sanctions on Iran were lifted in 2016 under a deal reached between Tehran and major powers aimed at curbing the country\u2019s nuclear programme. \nRouhani secured the deal in 2015, raising hopes of better economic times among many Iranians, but discontent has since risen over the lack of broad improvement in living standards.

{"published":"2018-01-02T02:00:00.000+02:00","title":"What Does MiFID Stand For? Here\u2019s What You Need to Know | Fortune","text":"By Bloomberg January 2, 2018 \nEveryone in European finance has been abuzz over an obscure acronym\u2014MiFID II\u2014that\u2019s about to radically change how assets from stocks to commodities are traded and investors\u2019 money is managed. \nBanks and asset managers across the European Union have spent more than $2 billion preparing for it. Regulators say it will protect investors, boost transparency and rebuild trust that was tarnished by the 2008 global crash. The industry has even spent months finding ways to sidestep parts of it. \nBut you\u2019d be forgiven for not paying attention: MiFID II is a law entering into force on Jan. 3 that, according to one count, is already close to 7,000 pages in length with all its addendums. That\u2019s five times longer than Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace\u2014and vastly less readable. \nIt has taken seven years to get the second iteration of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive into shape because of its wide scope. For starters, it alters how investment research is paid for, how trades are documented and executed, and how brokers share information, find the best prices and pay one another. \n\u201cIt\u2019s all about casting light in areas of the market that were previously dark, transparency and ultimately treating the investor at all times in a fair manner,\u201d said Ronan Brennan, Dublin-based chief product officer at Compliance Solutions Strategies, which is working with firms to help them meet MiFID\u2019s many demands. Here\u2019s a look at what MiFID II will mean for European finance. 1) What\u2019s all the fuss about changes to research? \nFund managers now have to pay for the research they use. They can no longer call up their favorite analyst for free for the lowdown on what stocks are hot or how the latest twist in Brexit negotiations will affect their portfolios. They may not even be able to access the hundreds of research reports that have long inundated their email inboxes daily unless they intend to pay. \nThat\u2019s because MiFID II forces investment banks to charge separately for research and brokerage services to avoid conflicts of interest. Up to now, the cost of research was built into the fees that the likes of Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley get paid to execute trades. That worried regulators because it opened the way for commissions to go to banks that offered the best tips and access, rather than the best prices for putting through a client\u2019s trades. \nAs fund managers get more choosy, it\u2019s widely expected the prices being quoted for access to research will drop in 2018, and some analysts could lose their jobs. 2) How will MiFID make stock markets more transparent? \nMiFID II clamps down on so-called dark pools. Unlike public, or \u201clit\u201d markets, such as the London Stock Exchange, dark pools are private markets that allow investors to buy and sell large blocks of shares without revealing beforehand the size of the orders or the price they paid. \nEven regulators acknowledge that they serve an important market function. Say a fund manager were to take a huge order for a stock, like two million shares, to a public exchange. On seeing the order, high-frequency traders, who use algorithms to spot block orders, could trade against them almost instantly. \nBut stock exchanges have complained for years that too much trading takes place on dark pools, depriving investors of the best prices and them of juicy trading fees. So MiFID II imposes limits: only 8 percent of volume in any stock can change hands this way. 3) Will the industry keep trading in the dark anyway? \nThe short answer: yes. There are two key ways trading will still take place beyond the public gaze for orders that are too small for dark pools but too big to risk placing on a stock exchange: \nThe most contentious is called a systematic internalizer. It\u2019s the new name that banks and trading firms will go by when they fill their clients\u2019 buy or sell orders directly using their own capital. Public exchanges and some other trading venues will also hold periodic auctions which hide the order size for a stock until sufficient volume has been accumulated to trigger a sale. \n\u201cWe are likely to see a distinct drop in dark trading once the caps are in force,\u201d said Anish Puaar, European market structure analyst at Rosenblatt Securities. \u201cUltimately most of the trading will move to periodic auctions and eventually systematic internalizers. Some volume may shift to the SIs on day one, but many buy-side firms are still getting to grips with how they work.\u201d 4) How does MiFID II subject traders to greater surveillance? \nRegulators want to be able to spot risks early and quickly reconstruct events when something suspicious happens, so MiFID II will force the investment community to keep tabs of almost everything. Here\u2019s a sampling: \nInstitutions must report information about most trades immediately, including price and volume Traders of European Union securities must hand over personal identification, such as passport numbers, to every venue they trade on Brokers need to synchronize their clocks and time-stamp all trades Bond traders\u2014for the first time\u2014need to tell the market about deals they\u2019ve done within 15 minutes of them taking place Brokers and investment managers will have to record all conversations related to a deal and store them for at least five years. 5) What\u2019s in store for Jan. 3\u2014and 2018? \nImplementing the technology needed to comply with MiFID II has some in the industry likening Jan. 3 to Jan. 1, 2000\u2014or Y2K\u2014when many feared the transition into the new century would create havoc on computer systems around the world. \nWhether there are IT malfunctions or not, trading volumes are projected to drop across Europe in January as everyone adjusts to the new MiFID world. Given the enormity of the changes, regulators aren\u2019t likely to slap fines on companies for failing to be in full compliance, at least not at first. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

The company now expects to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter. \n\u201cWith absolute Model 3 sales tracking behind expectations and Model 3 gross margin improvement likely to be pushed out until production reaches greater scale, the expected cash tailwind from Model 3 will take longer to manifest itself than was anticipated,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst George Galliers said in a note. \nTesla, headed by Elon Musk, has been struggling to overcome production bottlenecks and reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss in the July-September quarter. \nThe company burned through $1.1 billion in cash in that quarter and said in November it would spend roughly the same amount in the fourth quarter. It had about $3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Sept. 30. \nChief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja had reassured investors that cash flow would \u201cimprove significantly\u201d over the next few quarters as Tesla continued to ramp up Model 3 production. Slideshow (2 Images) \nTesla shares were down at $313.02 in afternoon trading. The median price target on the stock is $310 and eight of 25 brokerages covering the stock rate it \u201cbuy\u201d or higher. Eight have a \u201chold\u201d rating and the rest a \u201csell\u201d or lower. \n\u201cWe believe that Tesla may have finally set a beatable production target,\u201d Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said in a note. \n\u201cImportantly, we believe that Tesla is prioritizing quality control. While Tesla\u2019s repeated guidance revisions could begin to risk damaging its elite brand, a mass-recall would probably be far more damaging,\u201d he said. \nTesla\u2019s luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs regularly require fixes before they can leave the factory and quality checks have routinely revealed defects in nearly all of these models inspected after assembly, Reuters reported in November, citing sources. \nTesla has maintained that its quality control process is unusually rigorous. \nAnalysts said on Thursday they continue to believe that sales of the Model 3 sedan could transform the niche automaker into a mass producer, giving it an edge over a host of rivals such as General Motors Co ( GM.N ) and BMW ( BMWG.DE ) who are entering the nascent electric car market. \n\u201cGiven that TSLA received over 400k Model 3 reservations with essentially no marketing, we believe potential demand for the vehicle is likely underestimated, and think TSLA could significantly increase demand through its own advertising in the future,\u201d Baird Equity Research analyst Ben Kallo said.

All eyes are on divided Senate, Trump as deadline threatens","text":"6 Hours Ago | 02:07 \nPresident Donald Trump urged Senate Democrats to get behind a short-term spending bill Friday morning as the deadline for funding the government loomed only hours away. \nTrump's tweet came ahead of a showdown vote in the Senate on a stopgap spending measure that passed the House on Thursday night . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell maneuvered to make sure the vote takes place Friday, rather than late Thursday, to put as much pressure as possible on Democrats who appeared set to sink the bill and restart negotiations to keep the government open. \nSome government agencies will run out of money if Congress cannot pass a funding plan by the end of Friday. \n\"Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate \u2013 but they want illegal immigration and weak borders,\" Trump contended in a tweet. \n\"Shutdown coming? We need more Republican victories in 2018!\" he added. Trump tweet \nGoldman Sachs economic analysts said Friday they see a 60 percent chance of a shutdown lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. Each week of a shutdown would reduce first quarter gross domestic product by 0.2 percentage points, the analysts said in a note, although the impact would be reversed in the second quarter. \nThe legislation before the Senate would fund the government through Feb. 16, reauthorize the popular Children's Health Insurance Program for six years and delay some Affordable Care Act taxes. The GOP included reauthorization of CHIP \u2014 a program popular with Democrats \u2014 in the spending plan largely to force the minority party to support it. \nThe bill passed in the House with only some Republicans voting against it and a few Democrats supporting it. However, it will need at least 10 Democratic votes to clear the Senate \u2014 and possibly more if the three Republicans who oppose it continue to hold out. Zach Gibson | Bloomberg | Getty Images Demonstrators hold illuminated signs during a rally supporting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), or the Dream Act, outside the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, Jan. 18, 2018. \nOn Friday morning, McConnell contended that voting for the bill should be a \"no-brainer\" and hit Schumer for putting his members \"into a corner\" over immigration. Shortly after 11 a.m., he said the Senate would move to a procedural vote on the measure \"soon.\" \nAfter it appeared House Republicans could adjourn on Friday as scheduled, members said they were told to stick around for possible additional votes. If the Senate rejects the House-passed proposed, lawmakers could have to scramble for an alternative. \nSaturday is the first anniversary of Trump's inauguration. He was scheduled to leave Washington on Friday for his private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where he was slated to celebrate his first year in office with a big-money fundraiser . \nHowever, the White House later said Trump will not go to Florida on Friday as the shutdown deadline loomed. \nDemocrats have cried foul over Republicans moving to pass a spending bill this week without also trying to pass immigration legislation. The minority party wants to approve a measure shielding hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation, along with Republican-sought measures to boost border security and reform extended family migration and the visa \"lottery\" system. \nAfter Senate Democrats joined Republicans in voting to proceed to the House-passed spending bill Thursday night, progress stalled as lawmakers were faced with the prospect of the plan failing. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wanted to hold the doomed vote on Thursday night. That may have set the stage for fresh talks on funding the government on Friday, and Schumer argued that lawmakers had enough time to put an immigration deal in front of the president. \nMcConnell ensured that a vote on the plan would not take place until Friday, thereby putting more pressure on Democrats to pass it or risk a shutdown. \nOn the Senate floor Thursday night, McConnell said Democrats were trying to hold the country \"hostage\" over a \"non-imminent problem.\" \nSchumer, in response, decried \"complete disarray\" on the Republican side. He argued for a bill that extended funding only for a few days, rather than a month, to give lawmakers more time to hash out a long-term plan. show chapters"}

In that case, where GDP shows sustained gains above 3 percent and the Fed finally starts hitting its 2 percent inflation target, the central bank may go from tapping the brakes to slamming them.\nThat may be the only thing that can stand in the way of a market rally that has been impossible to stop.\n\"What's going to be more difficult for the market is if inflation does in fact kick in,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \"The question is then, is the Fed behind the curve?\"\nMarkets will get a better look inside the mind of the central bank when the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday releases the minutes from its mid-December meeting. The Fed hiked its benchmark interest rate a quarter point at the session and raised its economic outlook for 2018.\nHowever, the post-meeting statement provided little in the way of insight into what drove the decision. Was the committee moved by tax reform? Growth prospects? A little bit of both? The minutes will provide more perspective both on why the Fed did what it did \u2014 and what moves are likely ahead.\n\"This is not strictly a science,\" Krosby said.\nIndeed, much will be left to interpretation. The market soon will have to deal with a new Fed chair, when current Governor Jerome Powell likely takes over in mid-February. In addition, there is one new governor, Randal Quarles, and another appointment looming in Marvin Goodfriend. Current Chair Janet Yellen is leaving when her term expires next month, and the New York Fed is in the process of picking a new president to take over for William Dudley.\nIn addition, President Donald Trump will still have two other vacancies to fill.\n\"If you look at the background of the new Fed board members, you would have to put them on the bit more hawkish side of the equation,\" Krosby said. \"How much more hawkish, we don't know.\"\nIndeed, the voting complexion will be changing. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, a reliably hawkish member \u2014 favoring higher interest rates \u2014 will return as a voter, and uber-dovish Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari will not be voting. Charles Evans of Chicago, who joined Kashkari in voting against the December rate hike, also will be on the sidelines.\nAmid the changes, investors have become more acclimated toward a more aggressive rate hike pace.\nFed funds futures trading indicates the market currently is pricing in March and September and now have increased the chance for a third hike in December to about 41 percent, compared with less than 30 percent a month ago, according to the CME. The Fed currently is projecting three rate hikes in 2018, while some economists, like those at Goldman Sachs and Capital Economics, indicate a year with four hikes is not out of the question .\nMohamed El-Erian , chief economic advisor at Allianz, has spoken of a \"beautiful normalization\" the Fed has achieved in raising rates off the near-zero level prevalent from the financial crisis until December 2015. The Fed has managed to guide the markets off crisis-era policies without causing inordinate disruptions, and in fact oversaw a market in 2017 that set historic new lows in volatility despite three rate increases.\nThe challenge will be doing it again in 2018 while the European Central Bank also is reversing its own high levels of policy accommodation.\nPowell \"is going to have to navigate the way toward rate hikes in the U.S. against the backdrop of a European Central Bank that is beginning this process as well,\" Krosby said. \"He's going to make sure the market accepts rate hikes. He'll telegraph it well in advance so that the transition from normalization to tightening is a smooth one.\"\nHow that fits into market behavior is the bigger question mark. If the Fed's schedule outpaces market expectations because of faster inflation, that's one factor that could take the shine off another big year for stocks.\n\"I think it's time to prepare for a rough and rugged year,\" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. Paulsen envisions a 2018 where \"the economy's pretty good here and globally and it's just too good from here for us to keep costs and rate structures in place. You're going to have to adjust them up.\"\nInvestors should consider taking up a cash position and shifting money from the U.S. to international stocks, he added. Sectorwise, U.S. positions in materials, energy, industrials, commodities and financials would outperform.\n\"There might be a better buying opportunity down the road,\" Paulsen said. \"It's just hard to stand in the way of a one-way train going north and say, 'be cautious.'\"\nWATCH: Though the market has accepted rate hikes, not everyone is convinced they're necessary .\nshow chapters Chief strategist: It's a mistake for Fed to raise rates now.

The EMA has said it would next discuss the issue in February.\nRichter, which has a market capitalization of $4.8 billion and earns most of its revenue from exports, will publish fourth-quarter earnings on February 8. Orban said there were no further cases of liver damage since the inquiry was launched.\nAsked about a worst-case scenario, Orban said as with any medicine, that would be health regulators withdrawing the registration of Esmya, adding that he saw \u201czero sign\u201d of that happening. \u201cThis is entirely unrealistic,\u201d he said.\nOrban added that Richter, whose biggest markets are Russia and the European Union, had nearly 100 billion forints ($390 million) of cash to spend on acquisitions and while there were several possible targets, no deal was imminent.\nThe CEO also said the outcome of the Esmya probe would have no impact on dividend policy.\nReporting by Gergely Szakacs; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle\n "}

This was true for roughly half of patients over age 90. \nDuring the next several years, 50 patients died. Not surprisingly, the largest percentage of deaths was among patients in their 90s. No one died of the skin cancers, however. \nIn more than one in three patients above age 80, and in more than half of those above 90, simply removing the lesion for biopsy left the patients cancer-free. In other words, the researchers say, \u201ca large minority of patients\u201d would not have needed more extensive treatments. \nTreatments for non-melanoma skin cancers range from immunomodulatory creams, to destructive therapies such as freezing, burning, shaving and lasers, to surgery, said Tholpady. \nFurther, his team points out, more than half of the patients who were in their 90s died within a year. \u201dThese small (cancers) would never have caused a problem,\u201d the authors write. Given that half of these oldest patients were free of cancer after their biopsies, \u201ca strong argument can be made for a watchful-waiting approach for the amenable nonagenarian,\u201d they add. \nDr. Brian Gastman, director of melanoma surgery at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, said a lot of money is spent every year on non-melanoma skin cancer, much of it in the elderly. \n\u201cParticularly in the oldest-old, life expectancy \u201cin theory would be much less than any non-melanoma skin cancer would take to actually cause death, and many are not generally life-threatening,\u201d Gastman told Reuters Health by an email. \nThe idea that some non-melanoma skin cancers in elderly patients can be monitored without formal treatment is \u201cintriguing,\u201d said Gastman, but the new data are not definitive enough to change the standard of care. \nThe authors agree. \n\u201cFuture studies are needed to investigate if a watchful-waiting approach is cost-effective and has higher patient satisfaction than surgical excision in this elderly population,\u201d they conclude. \nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2Cmo5db JAMA Surgery, online December 20, 2017."}

JAB, which acquired Keurig Green Mountain in 2016, also owns Panera, Caribou Coffee and other breakfast and coffee concepts.\nThe deal forges a path for JAB to be an acquirer and major distributor of drinks in the U.S.\nIn a change of course from its previous acquisitions, JAB is keeping Dr Pepper partially a public company. The new entity will be 87 percent owned by Keurig shareholders and 13 percent owned by Dr Pepper shareholders. With a public float, Keurig has easier access to cash for more acquisitions down the road.\n\"The public component gives us a broader toolkit that we could use for a consolidation going forward, allows us to think of some creative structures in that space and it also over time provides some liquidity if some of our private partners need to exercise some liquidity in an organized fashion,\" the company told investors, according to a transcript from FactSet.\nThe deal also gives Keurig access to Dr Pepper's drink distribution network, one of the country's major three. It therefore creates an option down the road for Keurig to shuffle its coffee and other products through its pipeline.\nKeurig will also gain access to Dr Pepper's allied brands, a portfolio of healthy and upstart drinks it has invested in and distributes through its network. These brands include Fiji Water and Vita Coco. Bai was an allied brand until Dr Pepper acquired it for $1.7 billion last year.\n\"I think that's a very good model for both of us together in the long term,\" the company said of the allied brand strategy.\nNews of the deal sent Dr Pepper Snapple shares up 25 percent to $119.58 in morning trading.\nKeurig CEO Bob Gamgort will lead the new company, called Keurig Dr Pepper.

The S&P 500 index rose above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and other major indexes hit record closing highs as technology stocks climbed after data showed U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, signalling strong economic momentum at the end of 2017. \"Continued gains from the U.S. stock markets which posted new record highs have spilled over to the regional markets, if the U.S. markets continue to rally, that should accelerate the Asian equities,\" said Manny Cruz, an analyst at Asiasec Equities Inc. Thai shares climbed as much as 0.6 percent, building on the previous session's 1.4 percent jump, led by gains in the energy sector as oil prices remained near levels last seen in late 2014\/2015, amid tensions in Iran and ongoing OPEC-led production cuts. Oil producer PTT Exploration and Production PCL climbed 2.5 percent to its highest since July 2015. Malaysian shares inched up to their highest since May 2015, with industrials and financials accounting for most of the gains.

Some senators told reporters the aim was to hold the meeting on Tuesday.\n\"Next week the president is inviting a bipartisan group of senators to the White House to discuss the next steps on responsible immigration reform,\" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters.\nFor at least the past four months, Democratic and Republican senators have been meeting behind closed doors to try to fashion legislation that would protect at least 700,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought into the United States as children.\nMany of these Dreamers are from Mexico and Central America and have spent most of their lives in the United States, attending school and participating in American society, despite their illegal status.\nTrump put their fates in doubt in early September when he announced he was ending former President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that allowed these youth to legally live and work in the United States temporarily.\nUnless Congress and Trump can agree on a legislative replacement, these immigrants will be subject to deportation at the beginning of March.

{"published":"2018-01-03T18:32:00.000+02:00","title":"Silicon Valley Sex Parties: Emily Chang's Brotopia | Fortune","text":"By Kirsten Korosec January 2, 2018 \nWomen trying to break into the bro-centric world of Silicon Valley apparently must also navigate another minefield: invitations to exclusive, drug-fueled sex parties attended by some of the tech industry\u2019s most powerful men. \nAnd it isn\u2019t once-in-blue-moon thing, either. These parties are a regularly tech industry occurrence, according to Bloomberg reporter Emily Chang\u2019s forthcoming book, Brotopia: Breaking Up the Boys\u2019 Club of Silicon Valley. Excerpted in Vanity Fair on Tuesday , the book will be released Feb. 6 by Portfolio, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group. \nHere, a few of most disturbing details from Chang\u2019s excerpt, which describes parties where the male guests and hosts include \u201cpowerful first-round investors, well-known entrepreneurs, and top executives.\u201d The Double Standard \nTo be clear, Chang reports that no one is forced to go attend the parties and notes that many of the people she spoke to see them as a lifestyle choice. Rather than feeling shame, she said, some of her (largely anonymous) sources spoke \u201cproudly about how they\u2019re overturning traditions and paradigms in their private lives, just as they do in the technology world they rule.\u201d \nHowever, many of the women cited tell a different story. Indeed, Chang writes that that the choice to attend such a party\u2014or to turn down the invite\u2014is more consequential for women than for men, particularly as it relates to their careers. \nFemale entrepreneurs told Chang that turning down invitations relegates them to \u201cthe uncool-kids\u2019 table.\u201d They miss opportunities to talk business and make deals, which they say always happens at these parties. However, attending the events can also have a negative impact. \nWhat happens at these sex parties doesn\u2019t stay there, according to the excerpt. Instead, it turns into industry gossip and can provoke unwanted attention and even torpedo job opportunities. In one case, repeat entrepreneur Esther Crawford told Chang that an investor \u201cfound it difficult to think of her simply as an entrepreneur rather than as a potential hookup.\u201d \nA key quote from an unnamed female entrepreneur: \u201cIf you do participate in these sex parties, don\u2019t ever think about starting a company or having someone invest in you. Those doors get shut. But if you don\u2019t participate, you\u2019re shut out. You\u2019re damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t.\u201d Found Hounder \nThe idea that there are scores of women\u2014sometimes called \u201cfounder hounders\u201d\u2014prowling Silicon Valley for a wealthy and innovative tech founder is rampant, writes Chang. The notion that there are women preying on these powerful men has helped them rationalize behavior that reportedly includes \u201cfeeding women inhibition-melting drugs at sex parties,\u201d according to the excerpt. \nAs one anonymous male founder told Chang, \u201cit\u2019s women who are taking advantage of him and his tribe, preying on them for their money.\u201d Even the MDMA is branded \nMDMA, which is also known as Ecstasy or Molly, is a common party favor at these events, according to Chang. It\u2019s hardly surprising that drugs are being used at a sex party, but the branding might raise some eyebrows: At these Silicon Valley events, Chang reports that the Molly is sometimes molded into the logos of hot tech companies. The drug use apparently sparks \u201ccuddle puddles,\u201d\u2014literally groups of people cuddling\u2014as well as sexual encounters. Progressively Old School \nThe parties are structured to fulfill the traditional male heterosexual fantasies, with a demographic stacked in men\u2019s favor. Only powerful men are invited and they are heavily outnumbered by the women, who tend to be young and work in tech or a related field like real estate or public relations, reports Chang. \n\u201cWomen are often expected to be involved in threesomes that include other women; male gay and bisexual behavior is conspicuously absent,\u201d she writes. \u201cOutside of the new types of drugs, these stories might have come out of the Playboy Mansion circa 1972.\u201d SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

The House, voting mainly along party lines, had approved the latest so-called continuing resolution Thursday to keep funds flowing through Feb. 16.

Claims for the prior week were unrevised.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 250,000 in the latest week. Claims had increased over the previous four weeks, with economists blaming difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations around moving holidays and unseasonably cold weather.\nThe Labor Department said claims for California , Arkansas , Kentucky , Maine , Hawaii , Virginia , and Wyoming were estimated. Government offices were closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday.\nIt also said claims-taking procedures continued to be disrupted in the Virgin Islands months after they were battered by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, while claims processing in Puerto Rico was still not back to normal.\nLast week marked the 150th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest such stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.\nThe labor market is near full employment, with the jobless rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.\nLast week, the four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 6,250 to 244,500. The claims data covered the survey week for January's nonfarm payrolls.\nThe four-week average of claims rose 8,500 between the December and January survey periods, suggesting some moderation in the pace of job growth. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 148,000 in December after surging by 252,000 in November.\nJob growth is slowing as the labor market nears full employment. There has been an increase in companies reporting difficulties finding qualified workers. There are about 5.9 million job openings in the country.\nIn its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that \"most districts cited on-going labor market tightness and challenges finding qualified workers across skills and sectors.\"\nThursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 76,000 to 1.95 million in the week ended Jan. 6.

Agribusiness revenue was $14.6 million, compared to $18.2 million in the fourth quarter last year, primarily due to the previously announced decrease in lemon revenues stemming from the delayed lemon harvest at its Arizona ranches that were impacted by excessive heat during the quarter and lower prices. Rental operations revenue was $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2017 and 2016. There were no real estate development revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nAgribusiness revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 includes $12.0 million in lemon sales, compared to $16.4 million of lemon sales during the same period of fiscal year 2016, with the decrease primarily the result of the aforementioned delay in the timing of the lemon harvest as well as lower prices versus the prior year period. Approximately 414,000 cartons of fresh lemons were sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 at a $21.01 average price per carton compared to approximately 521,000 cartons sold at a $25.91 average price per carton during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. As anticipated, the Company recognized minimal avocado revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, similar to the same period last year. The Company recognized a similar amount of orange revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 at $0.6 million, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Specialty citrus and other crop revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 were $0.8 million higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 primarily due to increased wine grape harvest volume.\nTotal costs and expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 were $20.2 million, compared to $20.4 million in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 decrease in operating expenses was primarily attributable to decreases in the Company\u2019s agribusiness costs mainly due to decreased third-party grower costs partially offset by increased packing, growing and depreciation costs and expenses. In addition, lemon packing costs were $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to $4.0 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, approximately 3.2 million cartons of fresh lemons were packed at an average cost per carton of $6.75 compared to 2.9 million cartons of fresh lemons packed at an average cost of $7.55.\nOperating loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 was $4.3 million, compared to a loss of $0.9 million in the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year, with lower lemon revenues being the primary factor in the decrease. Net loss applicable to common stock, after preferred dividends, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 was $2.8 million and compares to a net loss of $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. Net loss per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 was $0.19 compared to a net loss per diluted share of $0.01 for the same period of fiscal year 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA was a loss of $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to earnings of $2.0 million in the same period of fiscal year 2016. A reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income is provided at the end of this release.\nFiscal Year 2017 Results\nFor the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, revenue was $121.3 million, compared to $111.8 million in the same period last year. Operating income for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 was $11.9 million, compared to $9.2 million in the same period last year. Net income applicable to common stock, after preferred dividends, was $6.0 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, compared to net income applicable to common stock of $7.4 million in the same period last year. Net income per diluted share for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 was $0.42, compared to net income per diluted share of $0.52 in the same period of fiscal 2016. Net income per diluted share for the fiscal year ended October 31 2017 and 2016 is based on weighted average diluted common shares outstanding of approximately 14.3 million and 14.2 million, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 was $19.0 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $20.1 million in the same period last year.

The confrontation took place after what Israel says was a stone-throwing assault on its troops. \nThe case has made her into such a potent symbol for Palestinians that a commentator in Israeli left-wing newspaper Haaretz said Israel risked turning her into the \u201cPalestinian Joan of Arc\u201d. \nRight-wing Israelis, meanwhile, have debated whether the soldier had appeared weak by opting not to strike back. The Israeli army said he \u201cacted professionally\u201d by showing restraint. \nThe charge sheet against Tamimi, seen by Reuters, included counts of aggravated assault against a soldier, who the army said was bruised on his brow by her punch, obstructing a soldier in the performance of his duty and throwing stones at troops. \n\u201cTamimi threw stones at them (the soldiers), threatened them, obstructed them in fulfilling their duty, took part in riots and incited others to take part in them,\u201d the military said on its public affairs Twitter account. \nQadoura Fares, chairman of the Palestinian Prisoners Club, which advocates on behalf of Palestinians in Israeli jails, said the charges were false. Palestinian teen Ahed Tamimi (C-R) speaks to her lawyer Gaby Lasky in the military courtroom at Ofer Prison, near the West Bank city of Ramallah, January 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Ammar Awad \n\u201dTheir aim is to terrorize people, and they are trying to deter children and others,\u201d he said. \nTamimi\u2019s lawyer, Gaby Lasky, said she was certain some of the charges would eventually be dismissed, but nonetheless prosecutors may seek the maximum penalty for other counts. Slideshow (2 Images) \n\u201cI am sure they want to keep her as long as possible because they don\u2019t want the voice of resistance outside prison,\u201d Lasky told Reuters at the military courtroom in Ofer prison near the Palestinian city of Ramallah. \nTamimi was not asked to enter a plea at this stage. The military court gave her lawyer more time to study the charges. \nAn adult found guilty of assaulting a soldier could be jailed for up to 10 years, but such an outcome would be unlikely for Tamimi as a minor. \nThe incident occurred at the entrance to Tamimi\u2019s family home in the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh, where weekly protests against Israeli settlement policy have been held for years. Tamimi\u2019s father is a prominent Palestinian activist. \nTamimi made news two years ago when she was pictured biting a soldier who tried to arrest her younger brother. In 2012 she was presented with an award in Turkey and met its president, Tayyip Erdogan, after images of her confronting an Israeli soldier went viral.

(Trump) is saying the time has come to stop saying flattering words (to the Palestinians).\u201d\nBut Tzipi Livni, an Israeli opposition politician and a former peace negotiator, said \u201ca responsible and serious (Israeli) government\u201d should quietly tell Trump that it would be in Israel\u2019s interest to prevent a \u201chumanitarian crisis in Gaza\u201d and to continue to fund Palestinian security forces cooperating with Israel.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Trump\u2019s U.N. ambassador disclosed plans to stop funding a United Nations agency that provides humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees.\n\u201cThe president has basically said he doesn\u2019t want to give any additional funding, or stop funding, until the Palestinians agree to come back to the negotiation table,\u201d Ambassador Nikki Haley told reporters when asked about future U.S. funding for the U.N.

Ravindran, M.D., to the position of president and chief executive officer. In parallel, Dr. Ravindran will join BridgeBio Pharma, PellePharm\u2019s lead investor, as CEO-in-Residence, to advance its broader orphan dermatology portfolio.\n\u201cDr. Ravindran\u2019s biopharma industry experience and rare disease expertise will offer enormous strategic benefit to PellePharm as we move into our next stage of development,\u201d said Ervin Epstein, M.D., chief medical officer and co-founder of PellePharm. \u201cHaving been successful with the management and growth of multiple biopharma companies, Dr. Ravindran brings the right experience to PellePharm so that we may offer topical patidegib to patients as swiftly as possible.\u201d\nDr. Ravindran brings more than 15 years of strategic and operational biopharma experience to PellePharm. Most recently, he was chief business officer at aTyr Pharma (\u201cLIFE\u201d), a clinical stage rare disease-focused biotechnology company, where he led corporate and financial strategy, business development, and investor relations. Prior to that, Dr. Ravindran was senior vice president of corporate development for The Medicines Company (\u201cMDCO\u201d), where he worked to execute multiple transactions totaling more than $2 billion in potential aggregate value. Previously a practicing physician, Dr. Ravindran began his industry career as a venture capitalist for 10 years with Burrill & Company, Radius Ventures, and Asian Healthcare Fund. Dr. Ravindran is trained in Internal Medicine and completed his residency training at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Dr. Ravindran received his B.A. from Northwestern University, his M.D. from Jefferson Medical College and his MBA from the Kellogg School of Management.\n\u201cI am thrilled to join PellePharm at such an important juncture, as the Company prepares to advance topical patidegib one step closer to patients with Gorlin Syndrome. With PellePharm\u2019s scientific premise, clinical progress, and recently strengthened leadership team, the company is well on its way to meeting its mission of delivering therapies for rare genetic dermatological conditions,\u201d said Dr. Ravindran.\nPellePharm today also announced that it has expanded its executive team to enhance regulatory and operational capabilities. Alix Alderman is now vice president of regulatory affairs at PellePharm, and Gerd Kochendoerfer, Ph.D., is vice president of technical operations and program management. Both Ms. Alderman and Dr. Kochendoerfer bring many years of experience in drug development, quality management and global regulatory affairs.\n\u201cWe are pleased to welcome Dr. Ravindran, Dr. Kochendoerfer and Ms. Alderman,\u201d said Neil Kumar, CEO and co-founder of BridgeBio Pharma. \u201cAt this inflection point, having the right team in place, with the collective experience this group brings, enables PellePharm to more ably achieve its goal of helping patients with serious unmet dermatologic conditions.\u201d\nAbout Patidegib\nTopical patidegib gel has shown early promise in a Phase 2 clinical study in Gorlin Syndrome by blocking the disease at its source within the hedgehog signaling pathway. Topical patidegib was developed to provide the efficacy previously demonstrated by oral patidegib in Phase 1 trials, but without the adverse systemic side effects of oral hedgehog inhibitors. Patidegib\u2019s gel formulation is stable at room temperature for at least two years, making it a viable potential therapy for ongoing, at-home management of Gorlin Syndrome. Topical patidegib currently is being studied in a United States-based Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of sporadic basal cell carcinomas (BCCs).\nAbout Gorlin Syndrome\nGorlin Syndrome is a rare, genetic disease characterized by mutations in the tumor suppressor gene encoding Patched1 (PTCH1), which acts as the primary inhibitor of the hedgehog signaling pathway. This leads to hundreds of basal cell carcinomas, especially on the face and sun-exposed areas.\nWith no FDA-approved drugs available for Gorlin Syndrome, also known as Basal Cell Carcinoma Nevus Syndrome (BCCNS), the standard of care is surgery. People with severe Gorlin Syndrome may have as many as 30 surgeries per year, which can be repetitive and scarring. Approximately 10,000 people in the United States, or one in 31,000, are believed to be affected by Gorlin Syndrome. Gorlin Syndrome is known by several names, including BCCNS, Gorlin-Goltz Syndrome, Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome, or Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome.\nAbout PellePharm\nFounded by world leaders in hedgehog signaling, PellePharm, a BridgeBio company, is committed to targeting rare genetic dermatological conditions, including Gorlin Syndrome and BCCs at the source. PellePharm is committed to improving the quality of life for those suffering from Gorlin Syndrome and BCCs by providing an easy-to-use topical solution that eliminates the need for regular, painful surgeries. Topical patidegib is a first-in-class topical gel formulation of a proprietary hedgehog inhibitor.\nAbout BridgeBio Pharma\nBridgeBio is a clinical-stage biotech company developing novel, genetically targeted therapies to improve the lives of patients. The BridgeBio approach combines a traditional focus on drug development with a unique corporate model, allowing rapid translation of early stage science into medicines that treat disease at its source. Founded in 2015 by a team of industry veterans, the company has built a robust portfolio of ten transformative drugs ranging from pre-clinical to late stage development in multiple therapeutic areas including oncology, cardiology, dermatology and endocrinology. The company's focus on scientific excellence and rapid execution aims to translate today's discoveries into tomorrow's medicines.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20180104005482\/en\/\nPure Communications\nKatie Engleman, 910-509-3977\nkengleman@w2ogroup.com\nSource: PellePharm"}

FILE PHOTO: View of cross-Channel ferries in the port of Calais, France, after Britain's referendum results to leave the European Union were announced June 24, 2016. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo \nThe fortunes of France\u2019s busiest passenger port -- just 20 miles (33 km) across the water from Britain -- hinge on the UK\u2019s future trade ties with the EU, an issue that must be negotiated between now and March next year. \nGiven Britain has said it will leave the EU\u2019s single market and customs union, with profound implications for customs-free cross-Channel trade as well as Britain\u2019s economy, Puissesseau worries his plans may be overly optimistic. \n\u201cThe economic model for this new port is based on an increase in traffic,\u201d said the general manager of the port. \u201cIt\u2019s a strategic investment for the future of the town.\u201d \nHis blueprint is based on annual revenue growth of 2 percent. But that prospect looks remote if Britain goes for what\u2019s been dubbed \u201chard\u201d Brexit and leaves the single market and customs union completely, which would likely reduce the amount of trade through Calais in the short term. \nIn such a scenario, he would have to substantially modify plans, not least because the port lacks the infrastructure to accommodate customs checks for the 2 million trucks it handles each year. \n\u201cIf we get a hard Brexit, the whole plan will be at risk because we won\u2019t be able to finance the investment,\u201d he said expressing concern too about the wider impact on the Hauts-de-France region around Calais. \nAlready one of France\u2019s poorest areas, the fear is that post-Brexit tariffs and a return to a customs border will slow transit times, pushing up the cost of goods and squeezing margins. It could mean traffic being diverted elsewhere. \nWith unemployment well above the national average of 9.5 percent, officials fret Hauts-de-France will be left further behind. The far-right National Front party has made inroads. \n\u201cOne has to understand that just two additional minutes for (customs) checks means kilometres of tailbacks,\u201d said Philippe Hourdain, head of the Hauts-de-France Chamber of Commerce. \u201cFor us, everything depends on whether we get a hard or soft Brexit.\u201d FILE PHOTO: View of the port of Calais, France, after Britain's referendum results to leave the European Union were announced June 24, 2016. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo CLOSER TO LONDON THAN PARIS \nPresident Emmanuel Macron will hold talks with Britain\u2019s Theresa May in southern England on Thursday, discussing Brexit and the Le Touquet accord, a 2003 agreement that effectively allowed Britain to establish a border in France. \nMacron wants Britain to pay a greater share of the financial burden France says it has incurred from dealing with migrants at the frontier and handling more asylum demands. \nIf Britain and France fail to strike a new deal, the nuclear option for France would be to return to border posts on either side of the Channel, one government source said. \nThat would further weigh on Hauts-de-France, which in many respects sees its future tied more closely to London than French cities. It\u2019s capital, Lille, is 80 minutes from London by train. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s key for us is that Brexit doesn\u2019t make Britain poorer,\u201d said Jean-Paul Mulot, a London-based adviser to Hauts-de-France leader Xavier Bertrand. \u201cOur position is to do all we can to reinforce the cooperation and investments between the two sides of the Channel.\u201d \nOn a recent dull, foggy morning in Calais, trade in high street stores was slow. Arcade machines chimed in an empty casino hall and locals nursed early glasses of beer. \nNo French town has borne the brunt of the European migration crisis more than Calais. In 2016, former president Francois Hollande sent bulldozers to clear a sprawling migrant camp near the port dubbed \u201cThe Jungle\u201d, a symbol of the EU\u2019s failure to tackle the influx of refugees and economic migrants from Africa and the Middle East. \nNow it is Brexit at the front of people\u2019s minds, even if there are some positive signs for the region, too, with Britain\u2019s Liberty House upping its investment in nearby Dunkirk. \n\u201cEveryone talks about Brexit, but no one really knows how it\u2019s going to work out,\u201d said Patrick Genier, a 55-year-old electrical engineer. \u201cWhat we need is for business to flourish. The jungle is no more, but no one wants Calais to suffer another suckerpunch from Brexit.\u201d Reporting by Matthias Blamont; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Luke Baker and Matthew Mpoke Bigg"}

China, on the other hand, has promised Pakistan $57 billion in investments on infrastructure and energy under its Belt and Road Initiative,\" Madiha Afzal, a nonresident fellow at Brookings, said in a recent note. \"All this means that America has far less leverage over Pakistan.\" \n\"The history of Pakistan's relationships with China and the United States also shows that Pakistan's policy does not respond to strong-handedness, but to loyalty, and to being treated with dignity,\" she continued. \nFor Beijing's part, a Monday editorial published by Chinese state-run news outlet Global Times said that \"China and Pakistan enjoy an all-weather strategic partnership of cooperation, Beijing will without doubt not give up on Islamabad.\" \nRegardless of hardened rhetoric between the White House and Islamabad \u2014 Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif recently dismissed Trump's outburst as a political stunt \u2014 the two nations are expected to continue cooperating this year. \nUltimately, Washington needs Pakistani cooperation to address its concerns about Afghanistan and Iran , Baptist said, adding that it remains to be seen if Trump's social media tirade will translate into real policy change.

But the trend is a break from the axiomatic truth that flows chase performance. \nDomestic equity funds posted outflows of $27.3 billion in 2017, according to preliminary year-end data from Lipper, marking a third year of outflows for the category. \n\u201cIt was a phenomenal year as far as returns go,\u201d said Tom Roseen, head of research services for Thomson Reuters\u2019 Lipper unit. He said the average equity fund was up more than 20 percent for the year, adding, \u201cBut what we saw was a mass exodus from retail.\u201d \nNon-domestic equity fund inflows of $171.4 billion and Treasury fund inflows of $34 billion for the year are the largest on records dating to 1992. Emerging market inflows were the biggest since 2010, Lipper\u2019s preliminary data showed. \nThat cash from U.S. investors is helping keep bond yields and borrowing costs low worldwide. \nYet the domestic equity outflows are not universal. \nExchange-traded funds (ETFs), many of which track an index and charge lower fees than funds run by stockpickers trying to beat the market, had another record year of inflows. \nTechnology-focused equity funds pulled in about $13 billion for the year, the most since the sector\u2019s boom year in 2000, when they pulled in $41 billion, before the sector tanked. \nHigh-yield bonds, made up of the riskiest corporate debt, have been an exception to the festive atmosphere in bonds, posting $21 billion outflows for the year, the largest since 2014. \nThe following is a breakdown of the flows for the latest week, through Jan. 3, including mutual funds and ETFs: \nSector Flow Chg % Assets Assets Count \n($blns) ($blns) \nAll Equity Funds -8.397 -0.12 6,857.277 12,131 \n-Domestic Equities -10.797 -0.23 4,692.258 8,653 \n-Non-Domestic Equities 2.400 0.11 2,165.019 3,478 \nAll Taxable Bond Funds 3.279 0.13 2,632.191 6,041 \nAll Money Market Funds -7.094 -0.26 2,686.100 1,034 \nAll Municipal Bond Funds -0.048 -0.01 402.705 1,474 Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Leslie Adler"}

Rohingya refugee children play kites at Balukhali refugee camp, near Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh January 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Tyrone Siu \nSurakiart Sathirathai, a former Thai foreign minister, also expressed concern at the arrest of two Reuters reporters in Myanmar last month and said he hoped the case did not lead to broader restrictions on the international media. \n\u201cI think press and humanitarian access to Rakhine are important issues as well as free access to other stakeholders,\u201d said Surakiart in an interview in Bangkok. \u201cLegitimate press coverage is something that should be enhanced.\u201d \nMyanmar has severely curtailed access to Rakhine, where an army operation in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents has been condemned by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing - an accusation rejected by the Buddhist majority country. \nSurakiart, 59, was chosen last year by Myanmar\u2019s leader Aung San Suu Kyi to head a 10-member board that will advise on how to implement the recommendations of an earlier commission headed by former U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan. \nAllowing free media coverage was one of the specific recommendations in the 63-page report from Annan\u2019s commission, which was appointed by Suu Kyi in 2016 to investigate how to solve Rakhine\u2019s long-standing ethnic and religious tensions. \nReuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who had worked on coverage of the crisis in the western state, were arrested in Yangon on Dec. 12 on suspicion of violating Myanmar\u2019s Official Secrets Act. \nSurakiart said he had raised concerns about their case with Suu Kyi\u2019s national security advisor Thaung Tun. He said he had asked for the case to be dealt with transparently and been assured that proper legal procedures would be followed. \n\u201cI hope that this would not snowball in adverse directions for both the international press and the Myanmar government,\u201d Surakiart added. \u201cI hope the case will not lead to the Myanmar government not welcoming the international press. I want this to be a specific case and hope for a quick resolution to it.\u201d BRIDGING THE GAP \nThe Annan-led panel delivered its recommendations - which also included a review of a law that links citizenship and ethnicity and leaves most Rohingya stateless - just before insurgent attacks on security posts on Aug. 25 triggered the latest crisis. \nSurakiart said there were concerns over the repatriation of those who had since fled to Bangladesh and that the advisory board would need to find an approach to ensure people could return without fear, even if they were not recognised by existing law as Myanmar citizens. \nSuu Kyi has faced international criticism for perceived inaction over the crisis in Rakhine, but Surakiart said she was constrained by domestic politics. \nBuddhist nationalism has surged in Myanmar in recent years, and the army campaign has wide support. \n\u201cAung San Suu Kyi tried to address the issue by trying to build consensus from within rather than finger-pointing,\u201d said Surakiart. \n\u201cThere is a big gap between domestic and international interpretations of the situation in Rakhine. If we can\u2019t bridge this gap then it will be an obstacle for all of us who want to improve the situation.\u201d \nThe former Thai foreign minister also said his advisory board would seek to engage with all groups in Rakhine, including the military. \n\u201cThe advisory board is not a mouthpiece to anyone,\u201d Surakiart said. \u201cWe are not a spokesperson for Myanmar or the international community.\u201d \nThe board, which is made up of five members from Myanmar and five international appointees including veteran former U.S. politician and diplomat Bill Richardson, will meet the Myanmar government on Jan. 22 in the capital Naypyitaw before making its first trip to Rakhine on Jan. 24. \n\u201cI do not want the advisory board to be just a talking shop,\u201d Surakiart said. \u201cWe want to help bring about tangible progress.\u201d Additional report by Chayut Setboonsarng; Editing by Matthew Tostevin and Alex Richardson"}

The U.S. is emerging as, not only a military and economic superpower, but as an energy superpower,\" Martin Fraenkel, president at S&P Global Platts, told CNBC.\n\"We are expecting that by 2020, the U.S. is going to be one of the top 10 oil exporters in the world,\" he added.\n'Big shift in the dynamics of energy markets' In recent years, America's unprecedented oil and gas boom has been driven by one factor above all others \u2014 and that's shale . The so-called shale revolution could help to alleviate Washington's reliance on foreign oil, including from turbulent Middle Eastern states, while also helping to export to more countries around the world.\nIn November, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projected a dramatic increase in shale production could transform the U.S. into the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas by the mid-2020s.\nThe same forecast also predicted that the U.S. would likely notch another milestone a couple of years later.

OPEC's reluctance to cut output was also seen as a key reason behind the fall. But, the oil cartel soon moved to curb production \u2014 along with other oil producing nations \u2014 in late 2016.\nUS vs. OPEC war is 'far from over' A key step in clearing a global supply overhang has been OPEC and Russia scaling back production.

A woman walks on the esplanade of La Defense, in the financial and business district of La Defense, west of Paris, France November 21, 2017. REUTERS\/Gonzalo Fuentes \nBased on forward-looking indicators within the PMI release, the momentum is set to continue. The composite new orders index climbed to 58.0 last month - its highest since July 2007 - from 57.3. That demand pushed companies to add staff; hiring growth matched a 17-year record high set in November. \nEuro zone unemployment peaked at 12.1 percent in the first half of 2013. It has now declined to 8.8 percent. \nThe services PMI, which is part of the composite, soared to its highest in more than six years, 56.6, up from 56.2 in November. That followed a report on Tuesday showing the manufacturing PMI climbed to its highest in more than two decades of survey data. \nBut price pressure eased, a disappointing development for the ECB, which has been struggling to boost inflation. The rate of increases in input costs and what business charge consumers slowed for the first time in five months. Still, inflationary pressures remain at levels not seen in over six years. \n\u201cBased on past experience, the extent to which demand appears to be outstripping supply for many goods and services suggests that inflationary pressures could continue to build in the coming months,\u201d noted Williamson. \n\u201dA big question for 2018 will therefore be whether relatively high unemployment and spare capacity in many \ncountries will continue to hold down pay growth and keep a ceiling on consumer price inflation.\u201d Reporting by Rahul Karunakar, editing by Larry King"}
{"published":"2018-01-02T06:40:00.000+02:00","title":"GLOBAL ECONOMY-Asian factories end 2017 on mixed note; c.banks seen hiking slowly","text":"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asia\u2019s factories ended a strong 2017 on a mixed note, with activity at multi-year highs in Taiwan and India and surprisingly picking up in China, but contracting in some places in a sign regional interest rate hikes likely will be gradual. \nA trend of synchronised global growth that became apparent over the course of last year looked set to continue, with activity surveys in the euro zone and the United States later in the day expected to post strong readings. \n\u201cRobust external demand and accommodative domestic monetary policy should help keep Asian manufacturing sectors in good shape,\u201d said Krystal Tan, Asia economist at Capital Economics. \nIn China, manufacturing growth unexpectedly picked up to a four-month high in December amid a surge in new orders, suggesting continued strength in global trade. \nThe Caixin\/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 last month, from 50.8 in November, and far outpaced economists\u2019 expectations for a dip to 50.6. The 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis. \nTuesday\u2019s survey, which pushed Asian shares .MIAPJ0000PUS to their highest in a decade, was somewhat at odds with a much larger official China PMI survey on Sunday. It showed a slowdown in growth amid a crackdown on pollution and measures to curb risky financing and cool the housing market. \nAnalysts say the difference stems from the fact that the Caixin\/PMI index tracks smaller, private firms, more sensitive to exports. \nA CHINA SLOWDOWN? China is expected to have grown by close to 7 percent in 2017, but the world\u2019s second largest economy is likely to slow in the new year on the back of those measures, highlighted as policy priorities at October\u2019s key Communist Party congress. \nBeijing is expected to target 2018 growth at around 6.5 percent. \n\u201cWe believe a moderate growth slowdown to be more visible in the first half of 2018, especially on the investment front, due mainly to the tight financial conditions and a cooldown of the property market,\u201d BofA Merrill Lynch economists said. \nChina\u2019s slowdown means that for the rest of Asia, the pace of rate increases is unlikely to match that of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is seen hiking 2-3 times in 2018. \nThere will likely be \u201conly a few rate hikes here and there across the region over the coming two years,\u201d HSBC analysts said in a note, even as they expect Asian economies to keep chugging along in 2018, led by tech and trade. \nIn November, the Bank of Korea raised interest rates for the first time in more than six years, becoming the first major Asian central bank to hike since 2014. Malaysia and the Philippines could hike early this year, then Australia and New Zealand later on. \nRIDING A TECH BOOM On Sunday, South Korea\u2019s central bank chief said monetary policy should remain accommodative as inflationary pressures remained weak. Factory activity, which has been riding a global tech boom, contracted in December, dropping from a 4-1\/2 year high in November, the Nikkei\/Markit survey showed. \nAnother major tech producer, Taiwan, saw manufacturing activity hitting its highest since April 2011 at 56.6 last month, according to a December survey. \nSingapore on Tuesday posted slower economic growth in the fourth quarter than the third as manufacturing shrank 11.5 percent following an eye-popping 38 percent jump in the previous three months. \nHowever, full-year growth was still the fastest in three years at 3.5 percent, raising the possibility that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) could tighten its exchange rate-based monetary policy this year. \n\u201cGiven robust GDP growth and inflation upside risk, we think MAS will shift and tighten to a \u2018mild appreciation bias\u2019 at the April meeting,\u201d Maybank Kim Eng economist Chua Hak Bin said. \nPMIs for Japan, which surpassed growth expectations in 2017 on the back of the surging tech and trade cycle globally, will be released on Thursday. \nThe Nikkei\/Markit survey for India\u2019s December factory activity showed it expanded at the fastest pace in five years, buoyed by a rise in output and new orders, which allowed firms to raise prices. The data firms up views that interest rates in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy have probably bottomed. \nDecember factory activity accelerated in Vietnam, but shrank marginally in Malaysia and Indonesia. \nReporting by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Richard Borsuk\n "}

Darrell Issa said he won't seek re-election to a 10th term representing his San Diego-area district . On Monday, his California colleague Ed Royce said he will decline to seek a 14th term in his district outside Los Angeles. \nThat makes 30 Republicans so far who plan to leave the House by year-end, either to retire or seek higher office. That's twice the number of departing House Democrats \u2014 presenting a major opportunity for a minority party that needs 24 more seats to snatch back the speaker's gavel for Nancy Pelosi . \nThe Republican exodus stems in part from historical patterns. The party holding the White House nearly always loses seats in midterm elections. \nIt has been propelled further by the bombastic and divisive White House debut of President Donald Trump , who is the least-popular new president in the history of polling. Presidential popularity is a leading indicator of midterm election results. \nThe trend has received yet more fuel from the nature of the Republican agenda. Trump's pursuit of a wall on the Mexican border has heightened political dangers for Republicans in districts with Hispanic constituencies, as the tax-cut bill has done for those representing areas hard-hit by the reduction of state and local tax deductions. \nRoyce and Issa represent prime examples of Republican incumbents in the line of fire. So do other moderate-minded Republican retirees such as Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey and Dave Reichert of Washington state. \nTo a lesser degree, the current climate has opened fresh opportunities for Democrats to recapture the Senate, as well. With Democrats needing just two more seats to make Charles Schumer of New York the majority leader, GOP Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee have stepped away from the fight. \nNone of this guarantees a Democratic-controlled House or Senate in 2019. Democrats have many more Senate seats to defend in November. \nRepublicans in both chambers benefit from a strong economy and surging financial markets. The lopsided partisan balance in most congressional districts makes it difficult to knock off the majority of GOP incumbents who are seeking new terms. \nOne signal both parties will watch closely is the decision of House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Some of his friends expect him friends to join the exodus himself after winning enactment of his cherished tax cut last month. \nRyan's spokeswoman said recently that \"he's not going anywhere anytime soon.\" There remain 10 months until Election Day.

{"published":"2018-01-05T09:07:00.000+02:00","title":"Investors sense opportunities in Big Oil - but mind the gap","text":"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are gaining confidence - up to a point - that 2018 will be the year of oil stocks.\nFILE PHOTO: A oil pump is seen at sunset outside Scheibenhard, near Strasbourg, France, October 6, 2017 . REUTERS\/Christian Hartmann While shares in top energy companies have risen since mid-2017, they have failed to keep step with recovering crude markets, opening up a historically unusual performance gap. Big oil stocks have also underperformed broader equity indexes.\nUncertainty over whether the crude rally can stick and fears that advances in electric vehicles will undermine longer-term demand for oil still overshadow the sector.\nBut a brighter outlook for oil prices compared with the slump of 2014-15 - coupled with a revival in energy companies\u2019 profits and cash generation after three years of brutal cuts - could mark a turning point, according to investors and a string of global banks.\n\u201c2017 was a challenging year for investors but there are now real opportunities in the energy sector,\u201d said Olivia Markham, portfolio manager at BlackRock Commodities Income Investment Trust. She expects oil prices to rise gradually by 2020 as supplies tighten due to a dive in investment in recent years.\nUBS, RBC and JP Morgan have put out strongly positive outlooks for the sector in recent weeks, while Barclays analysts predicted on Thursday that earnings for the European integrated oil stocks could grow 20 percent from the third quarter.\nOptimists point to developments like Shell\u2019s ( RDSa.L ) raising in November of its cash flow outlook to $30 billion from $25 billion by 2020, assuming prices at $60 a barrel.\n\u201cAnnus Mirabilis. Highest free cashflow in a decade bodes well for 2018,\u201d Bernstein said in its outlook for European oil majors.\nFigures for last year are grim, due largely to a dismal first half. The MSCI world energy index .dMIWO0EN00PUS, which tracks top oil stocks, gained just 1.3 percent even though Brent crude hit 2-1\/2 year highs. Europe\u2019s oil and gas sector.SXEP, which includes Shell, Total ( TOTF.PA ), BP ( BP.L ) and Eni ( ENI.MI ), was the worst-performing in the region.\nLITTLE CONVICTION Oil majors\u2019 shares typically move in step with prices of the crude that they extract, but that correlation broke down last year. Since June, the MSCI index has gained 20 percent but Brent LCOc1 shot up 50 percent to around $68 a barrel, after OPEC and other major producers agreed to cut output.\nThe majors are set to cut spending on oil and gas exploration for a fifth year in a row in 2018, determined to maintain the capital discipline they imposed during the slump.\nWith production from U.S. shale deposits expected to increase sharply, scepticism remains over whether crude can stay at current levels.\n\u201cThere\u2019s little conviction on the oil price sustainability both from the market and from the oil majors because no one is touching capex plans or investment. Everyone is waiting to understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Angelo Meda, head of equities at Italian fund manager Banor SIM.\nAs well as slashing spending, the majors made tens of thousands of staff redundant and sold off assets to adapt to lower oil prices which, despite the recent gains, remain far below levels above $100 in 2011-14. Such savings have led to sharp increases in earnings in recent quarters.\nWhether the sector can extend the share rally and close the performance gap in 2018 depends on a belief that majors can still prosper should oil prices fall back again.\n\u201cFrom here it\u2019s a question of whether or not investors think something has really changed in the industry, that you can still have earnings improving even if the macro doesn\u2019t help you out,\u201d said Peter Hackworth, oil equity analyst at Goldman Sachs.\nAs well as the strong cash flow generation at the European majors, early signs of capital discipline among U.S. explorers and producers also point to a better picture for the sector this year.\nGoldman predicts big oil firms will return 13 percent in 2018, ahead of a forecast 9 percent rise in the Brent price.\nSCRAPPING THE SCRIP One crucial component in winning back investors\u2019 confidence is a return to paying dividends fully in cash. Offering the option of taking dividends in stock has saved the majors billions upfront but diluted their earnings per share.\nShell and BP have both made enough revenue in recent quarters to boost their payouts. Goldman Sachs estimates most big oil firms will have scrapped scrip dividends or made share buy-backs which offset the dilution in the next 12 months.\nAverage dividend yields of 5.5 percent will be more than covered by cash flow this year, Hackworth said.\nBut not all investors have yet accepted the message that current payout levels will continue.\n\u201cThe market is still discounting these dividends as unsustainable whereas today, right now, they are sustainable. So I think the market is overreacting,\u201d said Eric Moore, European income fund manager at Miton, who has been increasing his oil holdings in the past year.\nMoore\u2019s fund holds BP, Shell, Statoil ( STL.OL ), Eni and Premier Oil. ( PMO.L )\nAnalysts have also been revising up their earnings forecasts since October after sharp downgrades earlier in 2017. Any uptick in mergers and acquisitions - noticeably absent as the majors concentrated on restructuring rather than purchases during the slump \u2013 could also boost the sector.\nPEAK DEMAND? Investors remain wary that oil demand may peak due to eventual mass adoption of battery-powered cars and more curbs on fossil fuel emissions by industry to meet environmental targets.\n\u201cElectric vehicles and government policies on carbon have led investors to question the longer-term outlook for oil,\u201d Blackrock\u2019s Markham said.\nSome are hedging their bets, buying shares in battery companies and chipmakers involved in making electric cars while lessening their exposure to pure oil plays.\nBut the shift to cleaner energy doesn\u2019t necessarily mean investors are dumping the oil majors. Many are sticking with them but favoring companies which put more emphasis on renewables.\nNick Davis, European income fund manager at Polar Capital, said he prefers Total, which is investing more in gas as well as venturing into battery and solar power.\nBut in the shorter term, and with the electric vehicle picture still unclear, stocks do not yet fully price in these risks, analysts said.\nEvercore ISI analyst Doug Terreson said cash preservation remains the key for investors focusing on returns more than growth. For him, BP, Shell, Chevron ( CVX.N ) and ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) offer the best proposition in 2018, he said in a note.\n\u201cThe historical investment model which assumed that higher oil prices would always lead to higher share prices in energy appears disrupted. It failed in 2017 and will again in 2018, in our view.\u201d\nGRAPHIC - Oil prices and energy shares: here\nReporting by Helen Reid and Ron Bousso, Editing by Dmitry Zhdannikov and David Stamp\n "}

They also thrived in conditions which started with a strong trade wind blowing down the mountain, before abating late in the day. \n\u201cI got off to a rough start, bogeyed three and four from the middle of the fairway,\u201d said 2013 champion Johnson, who has never shot over par on the course. \n\u201dI was hitting some good shots, just didn\u2019t score very well. \n\u201c(Birdies at the sixth, eighth and ninth holes) got me back in the rhythm and played a really solid back nine.\u201d \nJohnson has not made many headlines since a fall on tournament eve knocked him out of the Masters last April, a tournament he would have started as hot favorite coming off three consecutive victories. \nBut he has done enough to stay atop the world rankings for close to an year. \nCo-leader Leishman is coming off a two-win season, and the easy-going 34-year-old has his eye on even bigger and better things. \n\u201cIt was tough (playing in the wind), really happy with four birdies, no bogeys,\u201d he said. \n\u201cYou play to win. Having a year like I had last year, confidence is high. I feel like when I\u2018m in this position I need to finish it off... but a lot of golf to play.\u201d \nThe diminutive Harman used an unlikely birdie at the par-five 15th to springboard into a share of the lead. \nAfter fluffing his third shot, an uphill pitch that failed to reach the green and rolled back nearly to his feet, he then made amends by pitching in his next shot from 80 feet.

REUTERS\/Adnan Abidi\/Files After four years of depreciation, Asia FX bounced back in 2017 owing in part to a rebound in exports, a synchronised global recovery, and investors reaching again for more risk.\nThe South Korean won - among the best performers in Asia last year - rose over 11 percent against the dollar, while others have all appreciated more than 6 percent.\nBut according to over 60 foreign exchange strategists polled this week, most major Asian currencies will slip back a few percentage points by the end of this year. Only some are expected to make modest gains.\n\u201cHow Asian currencies fare in 2018 depends on the effects of policy normalisation in the major advanced economies on global liquidity and ultimately on portfolio flows to Asia; and a strengthening and broadening in Asian economic growth with export recovery spilling over into domestic demand,\u201d wrote strategists at ANZ in their 2018 FX outlook note.\n\u201cWe see growth winning out in the end, though the currency moves in the region will be more diffused with growth-sensitive currencies outperforming, while high yielding currencies and those with external deficits underperforming.\u201d\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, lost about 10 percent in 2017 owing to uncertainty over whether President Donald Trump\u2019s administration would be able to pass sweeping tax cuts.\nDespite that success just before the end of 2017, traders remain unsure about the economic impact of those cuts, which will cost over 1 trillion in additional borrowing over a decade.\nThe greenback\u2019s ability to recover losses made in 2017 in the current year depends on the Fed\u2019s interest rate pathway.\nDespite the Fed hiking rates three times last year, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield failed to rise, ending 2017 at 2.41 percent, a tad lower than 2016\u2019s close of 2.43 percent.\nChinese 100 yuan banknotes are seen on a counter of a branch of a commercial bank in Beijing, China, March 30, 2016.

Attune\u2019s initial product, the EnsoETM (formerly Esophageal Cooling Device or ECD), is designed to modulate and control patient temperature through a single-use, fully-enclosed system that is inserted into the esophagus. Two lumens attach to an external heat exchange unit while a third, independent, lumen simultaneously allows gastric decompression, drainage, or the administration of enteral fluids such as tube feeds and medications. The EnsoETM can be rapidly placed by most trained healthcare professionals, in similar fashion to a standard gastric tube, and can be used to control patient temperature in the operating room, recovery room, emergency room, and\/or intensive care unit.

It's got one for peas of both the frozen and canned varieties. There's ones for egg whites, liquid eggs, and frozen egg yolks, too.\nBut one that's missing? Plain old eggs.\nIn fact, the FDA oddly states that \"no regulation shall be promulgated fixing and establishing a reasonable definition and standard of identity for the food commonly known as eggs.\" The loose translation: The legal definition of an egg requires that there be no legal definition at all.\n\"We have no idea why,\" says Sara Burnett, the director of wellness and food policy for Panera.\nNow the restaurant chain wants to change that. The company said that on Thursday night it submitted a petition to the FDA asking that the regulator define eggs to \"reflect a food made from a cracked shell egg without addition of additives or further processing.\u201d The one exception it wants to make is for \u201cpasteurization or other treatment to destroy all viable Salmonella microorganisms from the shell egg.\"\nThe petition comes as Panera, which last year was acquired by investment fund JAB Holdings , starts marketing its new breakfast sandwich--made, of course, from \"100% real eggs\" under the definition it\u2019s hoping the FDA will codify.\nBurnett says that as the company developed its new breakfast sandwich, it discovered that not only does the FDA not have a true definition of the ingredient but that its competitors are \"using the term very loosely.\"\nThe \"puffed scrambled egg patty\" in Starbucks\u2019 sausage, cheddar, and egg breakfast sandwich , for example, contains whole eggs, whey, skim milk, soybean oil, modified food starch, and less than 2% of the following: dicalcium phosphate, salt, sodium bicarbonate, butter flavor (sunflower oil, natural flavors, medium chain triglycerides and palm kernel oil), xanthan gum, guar gum, liquid pepper extract, citric acid.\nOver at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, the egg patty on its bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich is made of egg whites, egg yolks, soybean oil, water, and 2% or less of: corn starch, salt, natural flavor, xanthan gum, cellulose gum, and citric acid.\n\"When you ask for egg, you should get an egg,\" says Panera CEO Blaine Hurst, who took on the top job at the start of the year.\nPanera is now cooking the eggs in its breakfast sandwich over-easy, meaning that they\u2019re cooked on both sides but the yolks remain runny. Panera says it\u2019s the only chain of its size that it\u2019s aware of that serves a runny yolk. To prevent food safety issues, the eggs are heated to right below cooking temperature while they\u2019re still in their shells to pasteurize them.\nThis is just the latest dust-up in the food world over standards of identity. \u201cMany of the definitions are very outdated and haven\u2019t kept up with food technology and production,\u201d Burnett says.\nStartup Hampton Creek ran into issues with the FDA because its vegan Just Mayo product didn\u2019t contain eggs--an ingredient required under the product\u2019s legal definition. And largely in response to the explosion of plant-based milk alternatives, Sen. Tammy Baldwin introduced the Dairy Pride Act last year to compel the FDA to enforce the legal definition of milk as \"lacteal secretion\" obtained by the \"milking of one or more healthy cows.\""}

The February contract led the charge after investors bought that trading month and simultaneously sold deferred contracts. February hogs settled up 1.550 cents per pound at 72.975 cents. April ended 0.725 cent higher at 76.800 cents. MORE LIVE CATTLE FUTURES LOSSES CME live cattle lost ground for a third straight session following last week's softer cash prices and the prospect of lower cash returns this week, said traders. Monday was the first of five days in which funds in CME's livestock markets that follow the Standard & Poor's Goldman Sachs Commodity Index , \"rolled,\" or sold February positions and simultaneously bought deferred months. February live cattle finished 2.025 cents per pound lower at 117.225 cents. April ended 1.550 cents lower at 119.300 cents. The roll contributed to Monday's declines but warmer weather in the Plains this week, which might result in more cattle coming to market, was a major factor behind the selloff, said Oak Investment Group President Joe Ocrant. He added that last week's winter storm on the East Coast may have hurt beef demand in the region. A week ago packers paid $121 to $122 per cwt for slaughter-ready, or cash, cattle moved at mostly $123 a week earlier. The recent cold spell across much of the Plains and Midwest slowed weight gains in cattle and made it difficult to transport to packing plants. Sell stops and live cattle futures losses pressured CME feeder cattle contracts. January feeder cattle closed down 0.175 cent per pound to 146.450 cents. (Reporting by Theopolis Waters)\n "}

Two major policy interests under consideration are another go at health care reform or big cuts to entitlements and welfare, Axios reports . \nThe main question may center on the use of \u201creconciliation\u201d in the U.S. Senate. This procedural tool would allow the chamber to pass certain kinds of legislation which affects the federal budget\u2014including spending on programs like Obamacare, Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, and Social Security\u2014with a simple majority. (This is the same method that the Senate used to pass the GOP tax bill at the end of last year.) \nBut Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is reportedly at odds with GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan on whether or not to use reconciliation and pass another major bill without any Democratic votes. McConnell has voiced support for more bipartisan collaboration on significant legislation in 2018; Ryan and other House conservatives have urged a more combative approach. \nReconciliation\u2019s tactical appeal in the Senate is clear. The GOP holds just a one-seat majority in the chamber after the surprise victory of Democrat Doug Jones in last year\u2019s Alabama special election; that means they can lose just one Republican vote, even under reconciliation (Vice President Mike Pence would cast a tie-breaker in the case of a 50-50 split). \nBut the politics are more complicated. For one, reconciliation is a budgetary vehicle, and passing a budget is no mean feat given the intra-party disagreements among Republicans. And McConnell and his fellow GOP Senators may not be excited at the prospect of passing deeply unpopular cuts to popular programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and welfare on a party-line vote immediately after passing a deeply unpopular tax bill on a party-line vote. A bipartisan approach to reforming entitlements could, politically at least, help spread the blame around. Trump\u2019s opinion may shape the path forward given the disagreements between McConnell and Ryan. Related Articles"}

Sessions told me that marijuana simply wasn\u2019t going to be on President Trump\u2019s agenda. That it was something that they weren\u2019t going to deal with, that it was something that President Trump simply wasn\u2019t going to focus on,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cThat was back in the spring of 2016, and up until 8:58 this morning, that was the policy.

Under the Obama administration, the Department of Justice declined to enforce federal drug law against the substance in states that had legalized any kind of marijuana use through a directive known as the Cole Memo . \nSessions\u2019 Justice Department called Thursday\u2019s decision a \u201creturn to the rule of law.\u201d \nSen.

Marijuana is not the same as heroin. No one who has seriously studied the issue believes that. Quite the contrary. We should allow states the right to move toward the decriminalization of marijuana, not reverse the progress that has been made. \n\u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) January 4, 2018 \nMeanwhile, Sen.

The benchmark Bovespa stock index was nearly flat following a seven-day string of gains. Blue chips, such as miner Vale SA and state-controlled oil company Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro SA, led the gains. The rally in Brazilian stocks has been supported by investor bets on a market-friendly winner to this year's presidential elections who would advance President Michel Temer's austerity platform. Former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who has railed against Temer's policies, is leading opinion polls, but he could be barred from running if his conviction for corruption is upheld by a higher court on Jan. 24. Signs that the economic recovery is picking up steam have also supported demand for Brazilian stocks, which are bound to see earnings growth as Latin America's largest economy regains solid footing. \"Inflows from foreign investors remain substantial and the pipeline looks strong,\" analysts at the Magliano brokerage wrote in a report. The Brazilian real was also flat, roughly in line with major Latin American currencies, after strengthening 2.6 percent so far this year. The Mexican peso was down 0.2 percent, while the Chilean peso rose 0.1 percent. Traders in emerging markets have been closely following U.S. economic indicators and remarks by U.S. policymakers for hints over the pace of interest rate hikes there, particularly after a mixed jobs report last week. San Francisco Fed President John Williams told Reuters that the U.S. central bank should hike rates three times this year given that the already strong economy will get a boost from tax cuts. Higher U.S. rates could dampen demand for emerging markets, which offer higher yields.

People ages 50 to 64 are particularly badly affected by this year's flu. One possible reason why is a phenomenon called imprinting. The first influenza virus somebody's exposed to as a child has way of determining how he or she will respond to influenza in the future. CNBC.com Mike Blake | Reuters Emergency room nurse Richard Horner wears a mask as he deals with flu patients at Palomar Medical Center in Escondido, California, January 18, 2018. \nThis flu season is considered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be highly severe , but one age group is feeling it more than usual. \nPeople ages 50 to 64 are particularly badly affected by this year's flu, the CDC told reporters Friday. That could be because of the strains in circulation. While the predominant strain is the nasty H3N2, which is less well-protected by the flu vaccine, H1N1 is also sending baby boomers to the hospital. \nOne possible reason why, according to the CDC's Dr. Dan Jernigan: a phenomenon called imprinting . \n\"The first influenza virus somebody's exposed to as a child has way of determining how you respond to influenza for the rest of your life,\" said Jernigan, director of the Influenza Division at the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. \nWith H1N1 in 2009, for example, \"we saw a strikingly low number of people being hospitalized over age 65,\" he said. That strain first emerged in 1918. \"From 1918 to 1947, when that H1N1 was circulating, people that were exposed to that one seemed to respond better when this 2009 H1N1 showed back up,\" Jernigan explained. \nFolks not imprinted by that strain, in the 50- to 64-year age group, therefore may not have the same protections as older people. \n\"There's still a lot for us to learn about this,\" Jernigan said, pointing out it \"shows the complicated nature of influenza .\" \nAs for the predominant H3N2 strain in circulation this season, that first arose in 1968, Jernigan said. And it's continued to change, and evade the human immune system, since then. \n\"It really depends on a mixture of things: the environment, the virus itself and how it changes,\" and, he said, \"also the host.\" WATCH: Widespread flu outbreak causing serious complications this year show chapters "}

No tractor trailers or trucks allowed on the bridge at this time. \nCommuters who braved the storm worried that they could be stranded later in the day. \n\"I don't know where I'll stay tonight if I get stuck, probably with my boss,\" said Ran Richardson, 55, of Malden, Massachusetts, as he waited for a Boston subway to take him to training for his job as a Chinese-English translator. \nSchools were closed through much of the region, and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said schools in his city would remain closed on Friday.

The National Weather Service forecast winds up to 70 miles per hour, which downed power lines. \nAlmost 80,000 homes and businesses in the Northeast and Southeast, where the storm struck on Wednesday, were without power. \nUp to 18 inches of snow was forecast for Boston and coastal areas of northern New England. Officials feared fast-dropping temperatures after the storm passed would turn remaining snow on roadways to ice. \nThe storm was powered by a rapid plunge in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters were referring to as bombogenesis or a \"bomb cyclone\" and which brought high winds and swift, heavy snowfall. The wintry weather has been blamed for at least 14 deaths in the past few days, including four fatalities in North Carolina traffic accidents and three in Texas due to cold. Travel woes \nNearly 5,000 U.S. airline flights were canceled. New York's John F.

Sporadic delays were reported on transit systems, including New York state's Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North commuter lines, as well as the Boston area's Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority system. \n\"Years of Band-Aid solutions create nightmare situations when storm damage occurs,\" said Joseph Schwieterman, a professor of public policy and specialist in transportation systems at DePaul University in Chicago. \"Replacement parts are tough to find and maintenance process turns into major headache.\" \nIn New York's Fort Greene neighborhood, Mohammed Farid Khan, said his morning commute took three times as long as usual due to train woes. \n\"There were only local trains, no express,\" Khan, 30, said as he hunched with an electric drill trying to fix the handle of his snow shovel inside the convenience store where he works. There were few customers to disturb with the noise, Khan added, saying, \"It's very slow.\" @ChrisGNBCBoston: #Breaking coastal flooding in #Boston ongoing - Atlantic Ave is surrounded. @nbcboston @NECN Icy rescues \nA 3-foot tidal surge flooded the area around Boston's historic Long Wharf with icy seawater, prompting a massive response by emergency vehicles. Firefighters used an inflatable raft to rescue one motorist from a car surrounded by water up to its door handles, Boston Fire Commissioner Joseph Finn told reporters. \nThe flooding tied a 40-year record, the National Weather Service said. \n\"It's dangerous,\" Walsh said, adding that Boston officials briefly thought they would need to a evacuate a shelter near the flooded areas. \"We're keeping an eye on all those different floodings.\" \nOfficials reported traffic accidents throughout the Northeast, including in Manchester, New Hampshire, where a 32-year-old woman crashed a vehicle through the wall of a nursing home, according to police.

B-rated ethereum and digital currency EOS have the highest ratings.\nThat tough take is apparently a trademark of the 47-year-old independent financial ratings agency. Reports from Barron's and The New York Times from 2002 and 1992, respectively, note Weiss' lack of A ratings in coverage of insurance stocks, mutual funds and other securities. The Florida-based company usually flies under the radar in comparison to better-known agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's. Weiss says it does not accept compensation from the companies it rates for issuing the rating.\nshow chapters Weiss Ratings starts grading cryptocurrencies 12:19 PM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 | 03:09 Foreign cryptocurrency investors were apparently very worried that Weiss would issue negative ratings on digital currencies.\nThe agency said in a release Wednesday that \"staff was up all night last night fending off denial of service attacks from Korea\" and cited Korean social media posts calling others to bring down the ratings agency's website. The hackers then broke into the website, took information from it and are distorting it on social media, the company said.\nTweet\n\"Earlier commentary on social media expressed considerable fear we were about to release negative ratings on their preferred currencies,\" Weiss Ratings founder Martin D. Weiss said in a statement. \"So this may be an attempt to thwart our release today.\"\nSome digital currency exchanges have reported degraded service due to similar cyberattacks, which attempt to paralyze a system with a flood of information.\nWeiss said Friday on CNBC's \" Squawk Box \" that the agency uses a computer model to rate cryptocurrencies based on four metrics: risk, reward, technology, and fundamental aspects of adoption and security.\n\"You can have a great technology index \u2014 all the pieces are in place for a very nice, strong currency \u2014 but unless it's actually reality-tested in the marketplace, it may not succeed, and that's what this last, fourth index tests,\" he said.\nWeiss holds a Ph.D. from Columbia University. He founded the company as Weiss Research in 1971 after an early stint at his father's investment-newsletter publishing firm, according to the Times. The company went on to issue safety ratings on banks, saving associations and insurers.\n\"Weiss' cryptocurrency ratings are a great example of the ongoing institutionalization of the cryptocurrency industry and a healthy addition,\" Ari Paul, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency investment firm BlockTower Capital, said in an email.\n\"Their rating of Bitcoin suggests a misunderstanding of the core value proposition of cryptocurrency, however, as they seem to overvalue transaction capacity, and undervalue protocol stability, security, and decentralization.\"\nBitcoin, the largest digital currency by market capitalization, traded 1 percent higher midday Wednesday near $10,955, according to CoinDesk. Ethereum, the second largest by market cap, traded about 3 percent higher near $1,019, according to CoinMarketCap.\nThe median bitcoin transaction fee was above $10 for the last several weeks before dropping to $5 on Tuesday, according to bitinfocharts .

A winter storm sweeping across Ontario, eastern Canada and the northeastern United States is pictured in a NASA handout satellite photo January 6, 2018. NASA\/Handout via REUTERS \n\u201cIt\u2019s just too cold to put folks out there,\u201d the resort said on its website. \nIn neighboring New Hampshire, the ambient air temperature on Mount Washington plunged to -36 F (minus 38C), two degrees short of a record low for Jan. 6. But sustained winds of 99 miles per hour (159 km\/h) and gusts of up to 112 mph (180 km\/h) atop the 6,200-foot (1,990-metre) peak made it feel more like minus 92 F (minus 69 Celsius), the NWS said. \nThe brutal cold in parts of the East Coast and Midwest shows no sign of abating this weekend, but a thaw should begin on Monday, said meteorologist Bob Oravec of the Weather Prediction Center. Before then, conditions will probably worsen. Slideshow (7 Images) \nOvernight, more than 30 cities from New England to the mid-Atlantic states could experience record cold, Petersen said. New York and Boston are among the big cities where records could fall. \nAmong the coldest places in the country on Saturday afternoon were the small Minnesota towns of Cotton and Embarrass, where the mercury plummeted to minus 39F (minus 39C), the NWS said. \n\u201cThe air hurt my face,\u201d Charlie Jessen, 25, an employee at the Superamerica gas station in Cotton, 36 miles (58 km) northwest of Duluth, said by phone. \nEven so, temperatures for those hamlets in the northeastern corner of Minnesota fell short of a record low for the area, where sub-zero readings are not unusual in January. \nIn the more populous Northeast, New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport set an all-time low for Jan. 6 at 8 F (minus 13C), Oravec said. \nThe airport had closed from Thursday to Friday morning when snow created white-out conditions. Some passengers endured more delays on Saturday after the wing of a China Southern plane clipped the tail of a Kuwait Airlines jet on the tarmac. \nThe East Coast\u2019s first snowstorm of 2018 was energized by a rapid drop in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters called a bombogenesis, or a \u201cbomb cyclone.\u201d The phenomenon gave rise to gusts of more than 70 mph (113 km\/h) and produced snowfall totals of 22 inches (56 cm) in parts of Maine and 17 inches (43 cm) in parts of Massachusetts, the NWS said.

The new rules will take effect in July, Kentucky state officials said.\n\"Kentucky will now lead on this issue,\" Governor Matt Bevin said at a news conference on Friday. \"They want the dignity associated with being able to earn and have engagement in the very things they're receiving,\" he said of Medicaid recipients.\nDemocrats and health advocacy groups blasted the federal policy on Thursday, saying it would make it tougher for the most vulnerable Americans to have access to healthcare. The Southern Poverty Law Center liberal advocacy group said it planned to file a legal challenge.\nThe rules apply to those between 19 and 64 years old. Certain groups are exempt, including former foster-care youth, pregnant women, primary caregivers of a dependent, full-time students, the disabled and the medically frail. The Trump administration also said states would have to make \"reasonable modifications\" for those battling opioid addiction and other substance-use disorders.\nKentucky, along with 30 other states, expanded Medicaid to those earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level under the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement commonly called Obamacare.\nMore than 400,000 Kentucky residents gained health insurance through the program, the highest growth rate of Medicaid coverage of any state.\nAmong adult Medicaid recipients aged 18 to 64, 60 percent already have jobs, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation health policy research group. Most adult Medicaid recipients who do not work reported major impediments as the reason, according to Kaiser.\nBevin has said the program had become financially unsustainable under Obamacare, although the federal government covers the majority of its cost. The waiver is projected to reduce the number of people on Medicaid by nearly 86,000 within five years, saving more than $330 million.\nAt least nine additional states, mostly Republican-led, have proposed similar changes to Medicaid: Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.\n(Reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb,; Editing by Richard Chang and Peter Cooney)"}

Should they pay to get their batteries replaced? If so, what\u2019s the best way to do it? \nWhatever the case, many iPhone owners are upset. Several have filed lawsuits alleging that Apple (aapl) swindled them by failing to disclose that it would slow phones\u2014all in a sneaky attempt to get them to buy newer iPhones. \nApple has apologized for how it\u2019s communicated to the public about Batterygate, and denied that it would \u201cdo anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades.\u201d \nIn an effort to make nice with customers, the company also reduced the price of replacing out-of-warranty iPhone batteries to $29 from $79. \nThe entire topic is confusing for many iPhone owners. Here\u2019s our guide to what you need to know. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. Why does Apple slow down iPhone performance? \nIt\u2019s all about the batteries . Apple said that the lithium-ion batteries that power the iPhones weaken over time, causing smartphones to suddenly turn off despite showing that their batteries still have some charge left in them. For example, an iPhone battery with a 20% charge remaining may be unable to power the device (especially if it has multiple apps running simultaneously). Instead, it may shut down. \nAs Fortune\u2019s Jeff Roberts personally experienced in Dec. 2016 , having an iPhone abruptly shut down can be a major pain, especially when using mobile mapping apps to navigate in unfamiliar city streets. For the record: Cold weather also temporarily weakens iPhone batteries. \nTo deal with the problem, Apple released last year an update to its iOS software to fix the problem of iPhones unexpectedly turning off. The update slowed the overall performance of iPhone so as not to overload its battery. In other words, you end up trading performance for reliability. What happens when your iPhone\u2019s performance is throttled? \nWhen Apple\u2019s software intervenes to preserve your iPhone battery, apps running on the device may take longer to open and run more slowly (scrolling web pages may take more time, for example). Your iPhone may also automatically dim itself and lower its speaker volume. However, Apple said that its recent battery updates shouldn\u2019t hurt the performance of some key iPhone features like the ability to make cellular calls, use GPS, or buy things using Apple Pay. What iPhone models are impacted? \nApple has said that the battery software update it released a year ago affects the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE. Apple also said that it applied that battery tweak to the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus through an iOS update in December. The company said it plans to extend the update to other products in the future, meaning newer models of the iPhone like the iPhone 8 and iPhone X may get similar tweaks. How can I check my iPhone battery\u2019s performance? \nNew iOS updates Apple plans to release this year should give people more information about their iPhone\u2019s battery life. If you can\u2019t stand the wait, you can download the Geekbench 4 iPhone performance-monitoring app from Primate Labs, which published research about the battery problems in December. How can I upgrade my iPhone\u2019s battery? \nThe easiest way to get a new battery is to schedule an appointment at your nearest Apple store\u2019s Genius Bar. Depending on the length of the wait list and availability of replacement batteries, the process could take hours or days. If you instead mail your phone to Apple, expect a roughly five-to-nine day wait. How can I improve my iPhone\u2019s performance? \nAvoid cold weather, if possible, since that can affect battery performance. Apple says that iPhones are designed to perform best at 62\u00b0 to 72\u00b0 F (16\u00b0 to 22\u00b0 C). Avoid leaving your iPhone out in the sun too, as temperatures over 95\u00b0 F (35\u00b0 C) can damage the battery. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT"}

{"published":"2018-01-17T23:02:00.000+02:00","title":"Early reviews heap praise on Tesla's Model 3, with a few caveats","text":"Tweet \nReviews of the Tesla Model 3 praise the car as a futuristic, mold-breaking car that may be the best electric vehicle at its price point. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s perfect. \nOverall, Tesla\u2019s first attempt at a less expensive car than their higher-end S and X models has received strong acclaim for its smooth, quiet ride, uniquely minimalist interior and dashboard, and body design. \nBut some reviewers have taken issue with aspects of the car\u2019s unorthodox features, such Tesla\u2019s choice to forego a traditional instrument cluster in front of the driver in favor of a large monitor in the center of the dashboard. Some reviewers say they heard of or experienced a few flaws in the car\u2019s build quality. \nTesla has loaned out almost no press cars, so reviewers typically borrowed cars from owners, or rode in one at a Tesla event. And while the Model 3 is advertised with a starting price of $35,000, the company has begun production with more expensive versions that have longer range and added features. Many of the cars reviewed were priced more in the mid-$40,000 to mid-$50,000 range. \nAs Tesla always said it would, the car lacks many of the \u201cbells and whistles\u201d of the pricier Model S. It does not offer the performance of Tesla\u2019s ridiculously quick Model S P100D car (which sells for $150,000). But the Model 3 can go from 0-60 miles per hour in 5.1 seconds, Tesla has said. For reference that is more than a full second quicker than the $37,495 electric Chevrolet Bolt, which hits 60 miles per hour from a standstill in 6.5 seconds. \nBut overall, reviewers say the car is quick, handles well and is fun to drive. \n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to discover driving joy in a sports car that was painstakingly engineered to tickle the pleasure neurons of autocrossers and track rats,\u201d said Road & Track. \u201cFinding that in a family sedan \u2014 a car aimed at entry-luxury four-door buyers, the silver drones of white collar office parks worldwide \u2014 is an unexpected delight .\u201d \nThe design of the Model 3 is \u201c derivative, in a good way, \u201d said USA Today in one of its two reviews . \nThe car does bear a close resemblance to the Model S, with some important differences. First, it is shorter \u2014 around the size of a Honda Civic , said a review in Jalopnik. It is also not a hatchback, though its trunk is quite large , said a review by Autotrader. \nThe interior is simple and spare. \u201cThe Model 3\u2019s dashboard is an exercise in fanatical minimalism,\u201d said Road & Track. \nKnobs, buttons or other controls are mostly absent. Almost everything is controlled through a large horizontal touchscreen centered on the dashboard. This gives the cabin a clean, minimalist look reviewers extolled. \nHowever, the \u201cspare, stark layout of the Model 3\u2019s cabin makes the touch screen look tacked on , rather than neatly integrated,\u201d said Consumer Reports. Some reviewers said they would have preferred to not have to use the touchscreen for some functions. But using the screen might be no problem for people who used smartphones before they learned how to drive, Jalopnik said. \nThe Autopilot user interface could have been better, said a reviewer at The Drive, who drove the car across the entire U.S. in an \u201celectric cannonball run\u201d that ran just over 50 hours . \nReviews did mention that there has been talk among early buyers of build quality issues, and there are a few reports of defects. There were issues with the steering wheel freezing up and the display showing glitches while the car is charging, said one owner. At least one reviewer reported that some owners have criticized gaps between door panels on the vehicle. \n\u201cIt appears that the Model 3 is definitely showing some issues of a first-year car,\u201d said GQ. \nHowever, a reviewer at Jalopnik had a hard time finding flaws in the build quality of the vehicle he drove. \nMany Tesla owners who do find flaws may forgive them. Consumer Reports at one point gave Tesla\u2019s other sedan, the Model S, an average reliability rating, citing a number of issues, from reports of squeaks and rattles to stories of owners replacing the entire powertrain. Despite this, Tesla owners are exceptionally satisfied with their cars and are loyal to the brand, Consumer Reports said. \nTesla, though, will have to convince many more consumers to buy the Model 3 if they want to transition from niche car maker to the mass market. \n\u201cNearly 500,000 early adopters have put down $1,000 deposits for a Model 3,\u201d said USA Today. \u201cThat\u2019s a good start, but true success will require a zero to be added to that figure.\u201d"}

The meeting in Myanmar\u2019s capital, Naypyitaw, is the first for a joint working group set up to hammer out the details of the agreement. \nThe state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said a camp in Hla Po Khaung in northern Rakhine will be a temporary transition camp for people who are to be \u201caccepted systematically\u201d for repatriation. \n\u201cThe 124-acre Hla Po Khaung will accommodate about 30,000 people in its 625 buildings,\u201d the newspaper said, adding that some 100 buildings will be completed by end of January. \nAung Tun Thet, chief coordinator of Myanmar\u2019s Union Enterprises for Humanitarian Assistance, Resettlement and Development, told Reuters that the camp in Hla Po Khaung will be a \u201ctransition place\u201d for Rohingya refugees before they are repatriated to their \u201cplace of origin\u201d or the nearest settlement to their place of origin.

The authorities have said Rohingya Muslims could apply for citizenship if they can show their forebears lived in Myanmar. But the latest deal - like the one in 1992 - does not guarantee citizenship. \nMyanmar government officials have said the 1992-1993 repatriation deal, which followed a previous spasm of violence in Myanmar, would accept those who could present identity documents issued to the Rohingya by governments in the past. \nBuddhist-majority Myanmar has for years denied Rohingya citizenship, freedom of movement and access to basic services such as healthcare and education. They are considered illegal immigrants from mainly Muslim Bangladesh. \nBangladesh officials have said it was unclear when the first refugees could actually return as the two countries need to work out how to jointly verify the identities of returnees. \nUnited Nations agencies and human rights watchers have voiced scepticism about the resettlement plans and demanded a more transparent process to safeguard the Rohingya\u2019s voluntary return.

The consensus among industry analysts for annual revenue by 2020 stood at around $17 billion, he said. \n\u201cThere\u2019s been a change in the rate that genericisation takes place across the industry (and) we\u2019re facing some additional competition (in) hematology,\u201d he said after the update, which triggered a fall of as much 6 percent in Shire shares. \nShire stock closed down 5.4 percent at 36.65 pounds. \nAnalysts at HSBC said in November that Shire should reconsider its 2020 guidance after Roche reported positive clinical data from its hemophilia agent Hemlibra, a potential blockbuster which threatens some of Shire\u2019s products. \nShire had already been dealt a blow in June when U.S. regulators approved a generic competitor to Lialda, its drug to treat ulcerative colitis. \nOrnskov, however, said the setbacks had to be weighed against \u201csignificantly accelerated growth\u201d in its immunology franchise. \u201cThe prospects for Shire mid-to long term have not changed,\u201d he added. \nSeparating Shire into two units, one focusing on small molecule pills that treat conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the other on complex biologics for rare diseases, would improve performance in both, he said. \nShire has been a leader in neuroscience since it acquired Adderall-owner Richwood Pharmaceutical 20 years ago, and it had decided after a review that the unit warranted additional focus and investment. \nThe company said in August it was considering spinning off its hyperactivity drugs into a standalone group that analysts said could be worth as much as $8.5 billion. \nShire said it will continue to evaluate the merits of an independent listing for each of the two divisions, and would update the market in the second half of 2018. editing by Kate Holton\/Adrian Croft\/Alexander Smith"}

(AIM) to Enhance its R&D in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing","text":"Tampa, FL, Jan. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cancer informatics and digital pathology workflow solution provider Inspirata \u00ae , Inc. announced today that it has acquired Toronto-based Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Inc. (AIM). AIM has spent more than 30 years developing and commercializing tools that leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract cancer related information and data from clinical documents, such as pathology reports, molecular testing reports, treatment plans and clinician\u2019s notes.\nNLP is the application of computer science, linguistics and AI to interpret narrative text. More than 65 percent of clinical data is in the form of unstructured text in healthcare documents stored in electronic medical records and laboratory information systems. Without the use of NLP and other AI techniques to make this data available efficiently and accurately for analysis and reporting, cancer centers must resort to manual data abstraction, which is expensive, time consuming and error prone.\nOnce extracted from source documents and files, the discrete cancer data, which includes specific tumor properties, such as size, margins, nodal involvement, stage, grade, laterality as well as patient demographics and other information, can be stored and readily searched to create specific datasets needed for analysis and reporting. This includes the reports that U.S. cancer centers must provide to their state National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) as well as the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER). These federally mandated registries are responsible for reporting to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) all invasive cancers diagnosed in their respective states. In addition to Cancer Registry reporting requirements, cancer centers need to be able to employ cancer data for population health studies, to evaluate quality metrics, identify patient cohorts for clinical trials and cancer research, as well as for a wide range of other applications.\n\u201cThe acquisition of AIM is extremely strategic for Inspirata because it enables us to bolster our own NLP development efforts by leveraging AIM\u2019s 30+ years in this field,\u201d says Inspirata CEO Satish Sanan. \u201cAIM has an outstanding group of NLP engineers and data scientists as well as a solid leadership team that will remain in place and continue to focus on R&D and business growth. This acquisition also establishes a solid footprint for Inspirata in Canada, allowing us to better grow our customer base to our north.\u201d\n\u201cAfter spending the last 34 years building AIM into a leader in creating technologies to improve cancer care, I am confident that I am leaving behind a great legacy and turning the future of AIM over to an organization that is equally committed to the same goals we\u2019ve always had,\u201d says AIM founder and CEO, Peter Brueckner. \u201cContinuity is so very important and that is why our current Vice President of Engineering, Jack Golabek, will become the new CEO of AIM, reporting directly to Satish. I am confident that what we have built over the last three decades will flourish within Inspirata and that AIM\u2019s technology will form the foundation for a suite of superior cancer informatics products.\u201d\nAbout AIM, Inc.\nArtificial Intelligence in Medicine, Inc.

However, sales did not improve during this traditionally strong season for the brand, and the company slashed its estimates for fiscal 2017.\nThe company now expects net income to be between $108 million and $110 million for 2017, down from its previous guidance of $110 million to $112 million.\nIt said revenue should now be in a range of $1.138 billion to $1.142 billion, down from its prior outlook of $1.148 billion to $1.155 billion. The company also sliced its same-store sales estimates to a range of down 1 to 0.7 percent, compared with the flat to up 0.75 percent it had previously forecast.\nWhile sales were weak in December, King said he remains confident in the company's unit growth plans.\n\"Our new stores continue to perform very well,\" King said Monday in a statement. \"Opening new stores with outstanding returns remains a key priority and we are maintaining our plan to open fourteen to fifteen new stores in fiscal 2018.\"\nDave & Buster's expects to grow its number of locations by about 14 percent this year. The company has been one of the few brands to have double-digit unit growth and still produce positive same-store sales, Nicole Miller Regan, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, told CNBC in a recent interview ahead of Monday's news.\nBy mid-2017, Dave & Buster's had signed 23 leases for locations that are expected to open between now and 2019.\nMost notably, the arcade and sports bar has been filling real estate voids left by the closing of Sears stores all across the country. Adding brands such as Dave & Buster's to malls has become increasingly important to landlords and real estate firms, especially as foot traffic in these locations continues to decline.\nThe brand also has a flexible real estate model, which allows it to operate either within a mall or as a standalone location."}

In early trading WTI hit $60.74, the highest since June 2015. \nBrent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark, were down 53 cents, or 0.8 percent at $66.34 a barrel. The session high of $67.29 was the highest since May 2015. \nThe spread between U.S. crude and Brent WTCLc1-LCoc1 hit the narrowest in nearly two weeks. \nThe 450,000 barrel per day (bpd) capacity Forties pipeline system in the North Sea returned to full operations on Dec. 30 after an unplanned shutdown. \nRepairs have been finished on a Libyan oil pipeline damaged in a suspected attack last week and production is restarting gradually, engineers said. \n\u201cThe resolution of the North Sea pipeline issue is having the expected result that the Brent-WTI spread is narrowing today,\u201d David Thompson, executive vice-president at Powerhouse, an energy-specialized commodities broker in Washington. \nThompson added that traders have been returning to work from the holidays, boosting volumes. \n\u201cDespite the day\u2019s price weakness, both Brent and WTI remain in solid, long-term bullish trends - $58.95 is nearby support on WTI front-month futures and $65.60 is the corresponding support on front-month Brent futures,\u201d Thompson said. \nIran\u2019s Supreme Leader on Tuesday accused the country\u2019s enemies of stirring unrest, as the death toll rose to 21 from anti-government demonstrations that began last week.

The cuts started in January 2017 and are scheduled to cover all of 2018. \nU.S. commercial crude oil inventories have fallen by almost 20 percent from their historic highs last March, to 431.9 million barrels. \nStrong demand growth, especially from China, has also been supporting crude. \nHowever, rising U.S. production, which is on the verge of breaking through 10 million bpd, has tempered the bullish outlook. \n\u201cWe think U.S. tight oil production growth warrants close monitoring as it could spoil OPEC\u2019s market-balancing efforts, pushing the market into surplus in 2018,\u201d Barclays bank said. \nOctober U.S crude production rose 167,000 barrels per day to 9.64 million bpd, according to the EIA\u2019s monthly production report.

In interviews with Breitbart News after the news broke, he called Trump a \u201cgreat man\u201d and pledged continued support for his agenda.\nThe president took note. \u201cHe called me a great man last night so he obviously changed his tune pretty quick,\u201d Trump told reporters on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t talk to him. That\u2019s a misnomer.\u201d\nBradley Moss, a Washington lawyer specializing in national security law, said any non-disclosure agreement would not apply to Bannon once he became a government employee. The government has far less power to limit speech by employees than private companies, Moss said.\nA lawsuit could hurt Trump because Bannon\u2019s lawyers would be entitled to interview White House officials and collect potentially damaging documents from them in his defense, Moss said.\n\u201cI assume the cease-and-desist letter is aimed primarily at the public,\u201d added Michael Dorf, a professor at Cornell Law School. \u201cThe idea that he could block publication is absurd.\u201d\nOn Thursday, the White House said no personal devices, including cellphones, would be allowed in the West Wing beginning next week for security purposes. The moves followed the Bannon split but had been considered for some time.\nBannon helped Trump shape a populist, anti-establishment message and had been the president\u2019s link to his hard-line conservative base of support, which is often at odds with the Republican Party establishment.\nThe story that triggered the Trump-Bannon split was an offshoot of the investigation into whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russia to sway the election to Trump, allegations Trump and Moscow deny.\nManafort and business associate Rick Gates, another campaign aide, pleaded not guilty in November to federal charges brought by Mueller including conspiracy to launder money. Manafort sued Mueller on Wednesday, alleging that his investigation exceeds its legal authority.\nReporting by Steve Holland; Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu and Jan Wolfe in New York; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Bill Trott and Will Dunham\n "}

A change in leadership prompted by Buffett's departure would change the investment outlook for the company. 4 Hours Ago | 57:59 \nWarren Buffett is coming closer to naming a successor at Berkshire Hathaway . It remains to be seen whether the company will lose its lustre without the Oracle of Omaha. \nBuffett named Gregory Abel, 55, and Ajit Jain, 66, to the company's board on Wednesday. Abel will serve as vice chairman of non-insurance business, while Jain will serve as vice chair of insurance operations. \nThe appointments are \"part of a movement to succession over time,\" Buffett told CNBC in an exclusive interview . \nThe legendary investor's departure would put the company into unchartered territory for retail investors. Buffett took the company over in 1965 and has overseen its growth ever since . \nThe 87-year-old businessman currently serves as chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway alongside vice chairman Charlie Munger, 94. The Omaha-based conglomerate employs tens of thousands in a variety of businesses including insurance, mobile housing and industrial concerns. \nBuffett said on Wednesday that he is in \"remarkably good health.\" \n\"I feel terrific. I love what I do. I can't wait to go to the office in the morning,\" he said. \"There's nothing I'd rather be doing.\" \nBuffett said he will notify Berkshire's board and shareholders if he experiences any health issues. Berkshire's board already knows who would take over if something happened to him, he said on Wednesday. David A. Grogan | CNBC \n\"Probably no other company on earth has this kind of make up where you have someone who has essentially been running the company for 50 years,\" said Paul Schatz, president of Heritage Capital in Woodbridge, Connecticut. \nBuffett himself could not repeat his investment track record with the level of assets the company now has, according to Schatz. That will pose a challenge for his successors. \n\"They can do a great job, but there is no chance they will come close to the record he compiled over the last 50 years,\" Schatz said. \"The assets are just too big.\" \nSchatz predicts there would be some changes to the company's stock, which is sold in two classes, with Buffett's departure. \"Once Warren and Charlie are gone, there will be intense pressure to start paying a dividend,\" he said. \nMark S. Germain, founder and CEO of Beacon Wealth Management in Hackensack, New Jersey, said he still sees Berkshire Hathaway as a promising investment. \n\"The brain power of Berkshire Hathaway has not been diminished by adding more brain power,\" Germain said. \"The key players are still there.\" \nStill, if a sudden management change were to happen and Buffett was no longer at the company, Germain said he would put the company on watch. \n\"We put the buying of that particular investment opportunity on hold until we have time to evaluate,\" Germain said. \"It doesn't mean you go and sell everything.\" \nGermain said he thinks Buffett has made plans for Berkshire Hathway with the same long-term focus he applies to his investments. \n\"If I could pick someone to have been mentored by, it would be Warren Buffett,\" Germain said. \"Exactly as he looks for companies, he wants his company to be managed in the same fashion.\" \nMore from Personal Finance: "}

FILE PHOTO: An Airbus logo is pictured during the delivery of the new Airbus A380 aircraft to Singapore Airlines at the French headquarters of aircraft company Airbus in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, December 13, 2017. REUTERS\/Regis Duvignau \nExact figures have been kept under wraps ahead of an announcement on January 15, but the sources said Airbus handed over a record monthly total of jets in December, surpassing the previous monthly peak of 111 seen in the closing weeks of 2016. \nComing on top of 591 deliveries posted between January and November last year, that implies deliveries of at least 703 aircraft in 2017 as a whole, up at least 2 percent from 2016. \nA spokesman for Airbus declined comment. \nAirbus stuck throughout 2017 to an official target of more than 700 deliveries for the year, but abandoned a more ambitious informal goal of more than 720 deliveries in October due to continued delays in engine deliveries for the A320neo family. \nAirbus officials have said the delays have now eased, following a two-year wrangle with supplier Pratt & Whitney ( UTX.N ) over late engines for the company\u2019s fastest-selling jet. \nIt is the second year in a row that Airbus has been forced to accelerate sharply in December, with that month\u2019s deliveries accounting for at least 16 percent of the annual total. \nWithout disclosing numbers, Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier thanked staff in a memo for \u201chuge collective efforts\u201d that had seen the company break records for deliveries logged both in one month and in one year, industry sources said. \nStill, insiders said the strong industrial performance would be seen by many as a personal coup for Bregier, weeks before he is due to leave the company after losing a bid to succeed Chief Executive Tom Enders, who is himself leaving in 2019. \nAirbus is bracing for more internal changes this year as it emerges from a top-level power struggle and rows over the handling of corruption investigations, but ended 2017 with what appears to be a grand slam performance from its current regime. \nBesides ending the year on record output, Airbus is also heading for a record December in new business after soon-to-retire sales chief John Leahy announced the firming up of more than 700 orders, equivalent to a year\u2019s production. \nBoth Leahy and Bregier are leaving Airbus in coming weeks, handing their responsibilities to executives from outside the planemaking inner circle: Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury, who will replace Bregier as head of the planemaking division, and Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) civil engines head Eric Schulz, who will replace Leahy after he retires later this month. \nAirbus will remain in second place on deliveries in 2017 behind the world\u2019s largest planemaker, Boeing ( BA.N ), but analysts say the outcome of the order race depends on how many of the new sales make it into the end-year tally of net orders.

But some demonstrators have in recent days chanted slogans in favor of Pahlavi\u2019s grandfather, Reza Shah, breaking a longstanding taboo. \nPahlavi said he wants to see Iranians \u201cdetermine their own fate out of their own free will,\u201d and praised U.S. President Donald Trump and members of his cabinet for speaking in support of Iranian protesters. \nBut he said they also should take steps to ensure that Iranians have access to communication and social media tools, which they have used to share videos and messages documenting protests and clashes with security forces. \nIran, which bars the use of major social media platforms, also has restricted access to the Telegram messaging app, and Iranian users in recent days have reported major hurdles in accessing the internet. \n\u201cWe need more than lip service. We need to see concrete actions,\u201d Pahlavi said. \u201cThis has to be immediate ... As we speak, the regime is attempting yet again to try to shut down whatever it is, whether it\u2019s Instagram or Telegram.\u201d \nThere is a precedent for this type of U.S. intervention. In 2009, amid mass protests over a disputed election, an Obama administration official asked Twitter executives to delay scheduled maintenance so Iranians could continue to use the service to communicate. Reza Pahlavi, the last heir apparent to the defunct throne of the Imperial State of Iran and the current head of the exiled House of Pahlavi speaks during an interview with Reuters in Washington, U.S., January 3, 2018. REUTERS\/Joshua Roberts \nTechnology experts have documented numerous examples of commercial services being denied to Iranians, often because of concerns about running afoul of U.S. sanctions. \nActivists have urged tech companies to loosen their Iran policies, but say the Trump administration could expand exemptions to make clear that some services are allowed. \nState Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a news briefing on Tuesday that the United States wants to see Iranians have access to social media and other tools. But when asked if Google was \u201cover-interpreting\u201d U.S. sanctions on Iran by blocking access to one of its services there, Nauert said she had \u201cno idea.\u201d \nAsked if the State Department is urging tech companies to do more to ensure access for Iranians, a State Department spokeswoman did not answer directly but said U.S. support for the free flow of information to Iranians \u201cis a key element of the President\u2019s new U.S. strategy for Iran.\u201d EXEMPTIONS TO SANCTIONS \nThe Obama administration approved exemptions to U.S. sanctions that allowed for providing chat, email, social networking, photo sharing, web browsing, blogging and other personal communication services. \nTwitter and messaging service Signal did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Facebook and Google declined to comment. \n\u201cThe policies of these companies are not really clear,\u201d said Amir Rashidi, an internet security researcher at the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a non-governmental organization based in New York. \nPahlavi critiqued the Trump administration\u2019s decision to ban nearly all Iranian travelers and immigrants from the United States as part of a broader travel ban targeting several mostly Muslim countries. \n\u201cIranian diplomats still can travel (here) but innocent Iranians who in fact work and have built this country are barred from coming,\u201d said Pahlavi, who lives in the United States. \u201cWhy? Because they\u2019re under the so-called ban. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d \nA State Department spokeswoman said U.S. support for the Iranian people \u201cis a fundamentally separate issue\u201d from the travel ban.

Morris 12:36 PM EST \nCoca-Cola last week announced a major revamp of Diet Coke, including skinny cans and a variety of new fruit flavors. Diet Coke is still a pillar of Coke\u2019s business, but the revamp comes as it is facing dramatic headwinds \u2013 according to one analysis, Diet Coke sales were down a staggering 6% in just the last three months of 2017. \nIn part, Diet Coke has been hit by the broader, steady decline in soda consumption. According to an eye-opening new story in The Atlantic , that consumption peaked in the mid-2000s. Back then, Americans consumed, on average, a remarkable half-liter of soda per day. Those levels are down by nearly half after more than a decade of decline , and are projected to keep dropping. \nThe decline of Diet Coke, though, has been faster than that of any other Coke beverage. According to Atlantic writer Derek Thompson, part of that involves dramatically shifting perceptions of what qualifies as healthy. A decade ago, the fact that Diet Coke has no sugar or calories made it seem, for many, like a healthy choice. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. \nBut growing skepticism about artificial sweeteners \u2014 including evidence that they may still cause weight gain \u2014 means the most health-conscious consumers are shying away.

That skepticism of all things artificial may explain why sales of full-sugar Coke are actually still growing. \nThe fate of Diet Coke, and even of soda, doesn\u2019t entirely indicate the future of the Coca-Cola company, which has aggressively diversified into growing categories like juices, energy drinks and bottled water.

Immigration legislation, in particular a plan to protect hundreds of thousands of young adults who were brought to the United States illegally as children, is also on the agenda.\nWhile Trump and McConnell want to work on infrastructure first, Ryan is more interested in tackling so-called entitlement programs such as welfare.\nA White House official said the timing of legislation would be discussed as well as the political priority of giving Republicans substantive issues to highlight ahead of the November midterm elections in which the party will battle to keep control of Congress.\nAll 435 members of the House and a third of the 100 members of the Senate will be up for re-election. A Democratic takeover of one or both chambers could stifle Trump\u2019s agenda.\nThe meeting at the Camp David presidential retreat follows an uproar over a new book\u2019s account of an inept Trump White House. In the book, Bannon was Quote: d as calling a meeting involving the president\u2019s son and son-in-law with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential campaign \u201ctreasonous.\u201d\nTrump broke with Bannon on Wednesday after the comments attributed to his former advisor in author Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d were made public. Trump said Bannon had \u201clost his mind.\u201d\n\u2018COMPLETE FANTASY\u2019\nThe Camp David strategy session will provide an opportunity to switch topics after the furor over the book, which went on sale on Friday.\n\u201cThe White House doesn\u2019t mind the optics after a few days of the president unloading on Bannon and making our views clear on the book. The president sits down and charts the course forward ... with the actual leaders of the Republican Party,\u201d a White House official said.\nThe White House said healthcare, the fiscal 2019 budget, the opioid crisis and the effort to win Senate confirmation of Trump\u2019s nominees for various government posts would be discussed at the Camp David meeting, which will also be attended by Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise.\nCabinet members including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt will also attend, along with a handful of senior White House advisers.\nCornyn said the weekend meeting would help lawmakers and administration officials get on the same page about their priorities.\n\u201cThis administration came into office perhaps not really knowing for sure that they would win the election, and was a little bit behind the curve in terms of preparing. Now I think they\u2019ve recognized that that sort of coordination is really important in order to get things done,\u201d Cornyn told reporters on Thursday.\n\u201cSo I look forward to having those conversations and making sure that the president\u2019s priorities and our priorities are aligned.\u201d\nReporting by Jeff Mason; Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell, Steve Holland, Roberta Rampton and Susan Heavey; Editing by Will Dunham\n "}

Instead, Tesla said it now plans to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter. \nThe delay sent shares of the Palo Alto, California-based company down 2 percent in after-market trading. \nThe Model 3 is critical to Tesla\u2019s long-term success, as it is the most affordable of its cars to date and is the only one capable of transforming the niche automaker to a mass producer amid a sea of rivals entering the nascent electric vehicle market. \nBuilding the car efficiently and delivering it without delays to customers is also critical, as the money-losing company faces high cash burn. Delays increase the risk that reservation-holders will cancel orders. \n\u201dThe further delay to (production volume) will leave analysts and investors focussed on the implications for cash as we head through the first half of the year,\u201d Evercore analyst George Galliers told Reuters. \nThe company burned through $1.1 billion in capital expenditures in its third quarter and said in November that fourth-quarter capex would also be about $1.1 billion. \nRBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note that he did not believe Tesla will be required to do a capital raise. \n\u201cWe have them hovering about $1 billion in cash ... They don\u2019t have a ton of wiggle room though in our view,\u201d Spak said. \nIn delivering 1,550 of its new Model 3 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, Tesla fell short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts had expected 4,100 Model 3 sedans to be delivered in the fourth quarter, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet. \nThe estimates for Model 3 deliveries by different brokerages varied widely. While Evercore analysts estimated 5,800 deliveries, Cowen analysts expected just 2,250. A TESLA Model 3 is shown at the Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S., November 30, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake \nTesla said 860 Model 3 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the fourth quarter. \nThe company said it delivered a total of 29,870 vehicles in the fourth quarter, including 15,200 Model S vehicles and 13,120 Model X cars. Analysts had expected total deliveries of about 30,000. PRODUCTION ACCELERATING \nTesla had initially predicted to reach the milestone of 5,000 vehicles per week in December, but in November deferred the target to the end of the first quarter. \nTesla said on Wednesday its production rate had increased significantly despite the delays. \n\u201cIn the last seven working days of the quarter, we made 793 Model 3s, and in the last few days, we hit a production rate on each of our manufacturing lines that extrapolates to over 1,000 Model 3s per week,\u201d the company said in a statement. \nThat pace of production is still below that of many carmakers. A conventional car factory operating at full speed on two shifts can churn out nearly 1,000 vehicles a day. \nThe Model 3 - which starts at $35,000, or about half the price of its flagship Model S - was met with great enthusiasm when its prototype was first unveiled in early 2016. Tesla said in August it had about 500,000 reservations for the car and demand was not a constraint. \nProduction, however, hit snags during a period of \u201cmanufacturing hell\u201d Musk first warned of in July. Among the issues Tesla faced was its battery module assembly line at its Nevada Gigafactory, which required a redesign. \nIn its third quarter, Tesla built just 260 Model 3s. \nAlthough bullish investors have generally waved off early Model 3 problems, instead focussing on the future prospects of Tesla, critics warn that Model 3 issues could sour demand for Tesla\u2019s mass-market vehicle, delay sorely needed revenue and compromise the company\u2019s ability to raise cash in the future. \nTesla shares, despite paring some gains from a high of $385 in September, still trade at 46 percent above their price a year ago.

Bush administration.\nDuring his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee , Azar said in some circumstances it does make sense for the government to seek volume discounts for a health emergency.\n\"If the government is the purchaser, let's say for instance, we are going to be buying (drugs) as part of the opioid crisis program, and we're directly buying that and supplying it out to states and first responders, there's absolutely nothing wrong with the government negotiating that,\" he explained.\nBut when it comes to allowing the Medicare program to negotiate drug prices, that's where Azar splits with Trump. Under current law, private Medicare Part D drug plans administered by insurers do negotiate drug discounts, but the traditional Medicare program is prohibited from doing so.\n\"For the government to negotiate \u2026 we would have to have a single national formulary that restricted access to all seniors for medicines,\" he explained, noting that was the conclusion reached by the Congressional Budget Office under the Obama administration. \"That would be only thing that could change. I don't believe we want to go there in restricting patient access.\"\nUsing formulary plans that favor some drugs over others is how insurers, large employers and pharmacy benefit management firms secure deep discounts from pharmaceutical firms.\n\"For Medicare negotiating to work, they would have to say that some drugs are not available because they are too expensive, effectively creating a single set of drugs available for the elderly,\" said Craig Garthwaite, the director of Northwestern University's Kellogg's Health Enterprise Management Program. \"Frankly, that doesn't appear to be something that Americans are prepared for at this point.\"\nIn a heated exchange with democratic Senator Claire McCaskill , D.-Mo., Azar argued that the government would not be able to get any better pricing than private insurers and pharmacy benefit managers do for Medicare drug plans.\n\"But they're getting paid to do that. The government could do it directly \u2026 wouldn't that save us money?\" McCaskill countered.\n\"They do it better than the government would,\" Azar maintained.\n\"To his point, it is complicated to negotiate \u2014 there are so many drugs on the market, you'd literally have to have a contract for every drug on existence,\" said Les Funtleyder, a health care portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management. But he added that pricing pressures will not go away for the government or drugmakers with more baby boomers aging into Medicare.\n\n\"Even if Alex Azar is approved,\" Funtleyder said, \"these are issues that are going to be with us forever ... until we come to a decision on how we want our health care to be.\""}

She has pleaded guilty to one count of fraud and is expected to testify for the government.\n\u201cThis case is so sensitive because the nature of the evidence is going to make us all cringe, make us all uneasy,\u201d Howarth told the jury. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing particularly pretty about a deceased body that has been separated into parts, but I would hope no one would have bad feelings toward Mr. Rathburn because of that.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s failure to stop Rathburn sooner, despite a decade of warning signs, was one in a series of stories Reuters reported last year about the largely unregulated body broker industry.\nAs part of the news agency\u2019s examination of the industry, a Reuters reporter was able to purchase two human heads and a cervical spine from a body broker in Tennessee. The deals were struck after just a few emails, at a cost of $900 plus shipping.\nThe series also profiled two Phoenix brokers - one who earned at least $12 million from the sale or use of donated body parts and another who regularly supplied Rathburn. The broker who sold Rathburn body parts, Steve Gore, pleaded guilty to defrauding customers and is expected to testify against Rathburn.\nLast month, Reuters reported that federal agents discovered four preserved fetuses during the search of Rathburn\u2019s warehouse. According to government photographs obtained by the news agency, the fetuses appear to have been in their second trimester.\nThe fetus photographs are not cited in any court filings and it is unclear if they will be presented at trial.\nFriess reported from Detroit and Shiffman reported from Washington.

President Akio Toyoda, left, and Mazda Motor Co. President and CEO Masamichi Kogai, right, shake hands during a photo session at a joint press conference on August 4, 2017 in Tokyo, Japan. \nWith the announcement of Toyota and Mazda planning to build a new final assembly plant in Huntsville, the state of Alabama is flexing its muscle and influence in the U.S. auto industry. \nThe plant, which will employ 4,000 workers and crank out up to 300,000 vehicles annually, is scheduled to open in 2021. Once that happens, Alabama could become the fourth biggest state in the U.S. when it comes to manufacturing new vehicles. It's currently tied for fifth, with Tennessee, in annual auto production, according to the Center for Automotive Research, which tracks vehicle manufacturing in the U.S. \"With this announcement, our world changes overnight,\" said Tommy Battle, the mayor of Huntsville. \"It vaults Alabama to the top as an industry leader in producing the next generation of cars that will power our nation.\" That may be a bit of an exaggeration. Data from the Center for Automotive Research shows Michigan built 19 percent of the vehicles manufactured in the U.S. last year. That is more than double the production in Alabama. \nSo why is a state with 4.8 million people becoming more attractive for auto manufacturers and suppliers? It's all about location. \"This plant is going to be in the center of auto alley,\" said Thomas Klier, senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Klier has studied America's shifting auto manufacturing footprint and says Alabama benefits from being so close to other Toyota facilities. \n\"It's a very sensible location,\" he said. \"Toyota has an engine plant in Huntsville and two other facilities nearby in Mississippi, so this makes sense.\" \"Our investment to establish a new vehicle assembly plant with Mazda builds on the strong success we have enjoyed in Alabama where we produce engines for the North American market,\" said Toyota President Akio Toyoda. Meanwhile, Mazda will become the latest automaker to establish a final assembly plant in the U.S. \"We hope to work, learn and grow together with the people of Alabama and Huntsville,\" said Masamichi Kogai, president and CEO of Mazda Motor. \nMazda plans to build an SUV at the new facility as the Japanese automaker moves to improve a model line-up that has historically relied more on cars than utility vehicles.

(Last year's challenge was visiting all the states he'd never been to and meeting people there.) \nZuckerberg mentioned cryptocurrency only in passing as an example of technology that decentralizes power. But the concept could also help Facebook c atch up to Asian messaging rivals when it comes to mobile payments. \nIn China, it is so easy to make purchases with WeChat Pay and AliPay that cash is becoming obsolete . In Chinese cities, beggars seek mobile payments to their accounts using QR codes rather than spare change. \nCombined, Alibaba and WeChat hold an estimated 92 percent of the marketshare for mobile wallets in China, which has an estimated 500 million mobile payment users. The rest of the world has some 556 million mobile money accounts, according to research from finance industry consortium CGAP. \nshow chapters Zuckerberg says fixing Facebook is his personal challenge for 2018      17 Hours Ago | 01:05 By contrast, Facebook's payment features haven't really taken off. \nThrough Facebook payments, users can link their Messenger account to a debit card, and pay friends with a quick message, or make an e-commerce purchase via Messenger and Marketplace on Facebook. \nFacebook has already signaled at past F8 developer conferences that it will expand its payments business conservatively, to include bill payment and investing options, which those WeChat Pay and Alipay have offered for years. \nAccording to Mark H\u00f8jgaard, CEO and co-founder of Coinify , a tech firm helping businesses accept payments via crypto, \"It definitely makes sense for Facebook users globally to send some kind of token to each other. This could be currency or something else like points that you can redeem them for things within the Facebook ecosystem, like premium content.\" \nThe Chinese government has, for the time being, banned ICO's and forced domestic crypto currency exchanges to close shop. So Facebook could get an early edge on its overseas competitors by moving fast to build a crypto wallet or issue a possible Facebook coin.\nHere's the relevant part of Zuckerberg's post:\nWith the rise of a small number of big tech companies \u2014 and governments using technology to watch their citizens \u2014 many people now believe technology only centralizes power rather than decentralizes it.\nThere are important counter-trends to this --like encryption and cryptocurrency -- that take power from centralized systems and put it back into people's hands. But they come with the risk of being harder to control. I'm interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services."}

Just in the last year, Amazon acquired Whole Foods , began allowing Amazon Prime members to watch its movies and TV shows on Apple TV, created a camera that can help you pick out nicer outfits, was granted patents for delivery drones with wings and legs and much more .\nBut back in 1994, when a 30-year-old, newly married Bezos quit his Wall Street job to start Amazon , the business was pretty simple.

Despite his windfall, Bezos swapped out his 1987 Chevy Blazer for only a modest upgrade \u2014 a Honda Accord. \nThat's according to a profile CBS's Bob Simon did of Bezos in 1999 for \" 60 Minutes ,\" recently resurfaced by Geekwire , showing Bezos sporting khakis, a button-down and driving the car.\n\"What's with the Honda?\" Simon asks Bezos. \nAfter a laugh, Bezos, who according to The New York Times owned roughly $10 billion in Amazon stock in 1999, responds, \"This is a perfectly good car.\"\nDuring the interview, Simon also discovered Amazon's then-headquarters in Seattle shared a street address with pawn shop, a heroin-needle exchange and a \"porno parlor .\" And inside, Bezos' desk was made out of a re-purposed wooden door and two-by-four pieces of wood. In fact, the entire company used desks made of doors as deliberate message, according to the Times .\nWhy so frugal?\n\"It's a symbol of spending money on things that matter to customers and not spending money on things that don't,\" Bezos explains to Simon.\nBy 2004, Amazon employees were still using door desks , notes Fast Company. And in 2013, Bezos was still driving a Honda, though a slightly bigger model, according to Brad Stone's book, \"The Everything Store.\"\nToday, Amazon has a $620 billion market cap and reported $43.7 billion in revenue during its third quarter in 2017 alone, a 34 percent increase from the same quarter in 2016.\nBezos has some bigger extravagances , like multiple homes, a private jet and Blue Origin. \nYet \"frugality\" remains one of Amazon's core principles and the company sticks by Bezos' early mentality. Amazon even gives out an accolade called the \" Door Desk Award \" to employees who come up with ideas that save money. \nAccording to Amazon : \"Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention.\"\nDon't miss: Mark Cuban says he follows this advice from Jeff Bezos 'to a T' \nshow chapters Here's the future Jeff Bezos saw for himself at 80, if he didn't found Amazon at 30      5:18 PM ET Tue, 21 Nov 2017 | 02:09 Like this story?

Back then, it was deforested and severely depressed. They bought their 40 acres for a resounding $9,000, or just over $55,000 today . Now, their property is worth millions. \nThe Hesslers live in a house that they built, eat food that they grow and use electricity that they produce. That was always their dream: To live self-sufficiently, plus settle down somewhere Tom could focus on his artwork. \n\"If I had to describe your land to somebody, I couldn't,\" Marcus Lemonis tells the couple, now in their 70s, who he visits on Tuesday's episode of CNBC's \"The Profit .\" \"It's like in a fairytale book. It's so beautiful and so removed.\" CNBC Tom and Karen Hessler with Marcus Lemonis on CNBC's \"The Profit\" \nPot-farming wasn't originally part of the Hesslers' plan, but, as they found, it was a way to make money. \"We are the people who started this industry. There was nobody growing weed. There was nobody here, Marcus. Every piece of land was for sale,\" Tom says. \n\"You could've bought the whole mountain for 100 bucks,\" Lemonis jests, and Tom replies that you actually could have for just $36,000. \n\"Today it'd be $36 million,\" the host then speculates, which illustrates the millions the Hesslers' own property is worth today. \nAs some of the earliest growers in the region, the Hesslers helped establish Humboldt as what Lemonis calls the \"pot capital of the U.S.\" M ore farms gradually sprung up in the region through the '70s, and, by the '80s, Humboldt's economy was booming as the region supplied cities throughout the U.S. \nFor many, like the Hesslers, it has been a lucrative business. But that doesn't mean it has been easy. Farmers have faced the constant threat of crackdown from law enforcement, which persisted even after medical marijuana was legalized in Calif. with Proposition 215 in 1996. \nThe Hesslers' children, Nya and Elan, recall constantly wondering whether their parents were going to be arrested as they grew up. \n\"Certain kids in school you avoided because, like, their dad was a sheriff,\" says Nya, who recounts an incident where he was chased for 45 minutes by a helicopter through the woods by their property. \"I just finally just stopped and sat there and waited, and then they finally just flew off.\" \nLemonis interviews another Humboldt County grower who wasn't so lucky. At 29-years-old, with no prior criminal record, Johnny Casali was caught with 1500 marijuana plants. \"I woke up at 6 o'clock in the morning. Thirty federal agents showed up at my door, guns to my head,\" he says. He served eight years in prison. CNBC Foundation of the Hessler's home in 1971 \nAs of the New Year, recreational marijuana use is permitted in California, which now has the biggest legal marijuana market in the world. However, that doesn't mean growers are totally protected. \nAs Lemonis notes, the threat of federal enforcement remains. And many farmers struggle financially with a supply glut driving prices down and taxes cutting into their profits \u2014 steep enough that some continue to sell on the black market to avoid them. \nFor the Hesslers who have gone legal, however, business is booming. They just had one of their best summers ever. \"The weather's just been perfect. Absolutely perfect,\" says Tom. \nBut he's also put off by some of the recent competition brought by newcomers with no ties to Humboldt County looking to break into the industry. \n\" We've been doing this for 50 years,\" he says. \"And for almost 50 years people have been chasing us, chastising us, and trying to destroy us. Now they all want to be in with us.\""}

The whole idea of crypto is you don't need banks.\"\nIt's \"not interesting from a financial innovation perspective,\" Voorhees said.\nRipple is officially the name of a five-year-old start-up based in San Francisco that is developing a payments network for financial institutions. XRP is the name of the coin participants can use for transactions. The company announced in October that more than 100 financial institutions are using its network in some way. These include Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizhuho, Credit Agricole and Nordic bank SEB.\nRipple 12-month performance \n\nSource: CoinMarketCap \nIn November, Ripple said American Express FX International Payments and Santander would use Ripple's network for cross-border payments between the U.S. and the U.K. Several Japanese and South Korean banks are also testing Ripple's systems for cross-border payments. If all goes well, the banks eventually plan to send money using XRP, according to a Nikkei report. \n\"Definitely the ripple ecosystem is definitely going to have to get a lot bigger to justify where XRP is right now,\" said Michael Graham, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity who has covered internet stocks since the late 1990s. \"But clearly the use case for XRP is quite clear. That sets it apart from other crypto assets.\"\nWhen asked which firms are using XRP, a Ripple representative pointed to an October announcement that said a bank called Cuallix is the first financial institution to use XRP, in this case for U.S.-Mexico transactions. No other firms were named. Cuallix has main offices in Mexico, the U.S. and Hong Kong, according to its website.\n\"While it's not required for banks to use XRP, as the native digital asset to the XRP Ledger it adds further value to customers in sourcing low-cost, on-demand liquidity,\" a Ripple representative said in a statement to CNBC.\nBitcoin, the largest digital currency by market capitalization, is up more than 25 percent this year to about $17,000, or 1,500 percent over the last 12 months, according to Coinbase.\nIn contrast, XRP climbed 35,000 percent to $2.30 last year and has soared nearly 67 percent since to an all-time high of $3.84 on Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap. The coin remains the second largest by market cap, but fell to trade near $3 on Friday after leading U.S. digital currency marketplace Coinbase pushed back against rumors it would launch XRP trading. \n\"I think a lot of retail investors think that by investing in XRP they'll be able to own a part [of the business], but they're not a stock,\" said Dan Ciotoli, software engineer and blockchain analyst at Bespoke Invest.\n\"I'm kind of on the side that XRP itself is not going to be used by banks,\" Ciotoli said.\nHowever, Ripple said in a tweet Thursday that 3 of the top 5 global money transfer companies plan to use XRP in payment flows in 2018.\nLike many of the alternatives to bitcoin that have emerged, XRP offers far faster speeds than bitcoin, which was the first application of blockchain technology when it launched nine years ago. Bitcoin transactions takes at least an hour to settle, ethereum more than 2 minutes and XRP about 4 seconds, according to Ripple's website . \nAll that is faster than traditional systems, which can take days. But there are fintech start-ups such as TransferWise that already allow consumers to send money overseas more quickly and cheaply than most traditional means. In a November report, Bernstein Senior Research Analyst Lisa D. Ellis said a test found using bitcoin to send money overseas was nearly 10 times more expensive than using TransferWise and also slightly slower. \nCNBC reported, however, that bitcoin did prove useful for big-ticket items such as school tuition when both the buyer and seller held the digital currency. \n\"One of the things we all have to remember is the value of a token over the long term is really going to be driven by its utility,\" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said on Dec. 27 on CNBC's \"Squawk Alley.\" \"There's no question there's a lot of hype in this system.\"\nXRP isn't quite there yet in terms of actual usage, but then again, neither is bitcoin.\nWATCH: Ripple founder now one of America's richest show chapters With the cryptocurrency ripple hitting new highs, its founder is now one of America's richest people      23 Hours Ago | 00:50"}

Report says not clear yet By MATTHEW PERRONE, AP Health Writer Published 22 Hours Ago The Associated Press SHARES \nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Electronic cigarettes could be a boon to public health or a major liability, depending on whether they help Americans quit smoking or encourage more young people to try traditional cigarettes, a new report concludes. \nThe report issued Tuesday wrestles with the potential benefits and harms of the vapor-emitting devices which have been sold in the U.S. for more than a decade. But those effects may not be known for decades, in part, because of how slowly illnesses caused by smoking emerge. \n\"In some circumstances, such as their use by non-smoking adolescents and young adults, their adverse effects clearly warrant concern,\" said David Eaton, of the University of Washington, who headed the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine committee that studied the issue. \"In other cases, such as when adult smokers use them to quit smoking, they offer an opportunity to reduce smoking-related illness.\" \nThere are no long-term studies on the health consequences of e-cigarettes and little consensus on whether they are effective in helping smokers quit, according to the report requested by the Food and Drug Administration. \nThe experts found \"substantial\" evidence that young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to try cigarettes. On the other hand, experts found only \"limited evidence\" that cigarettes are effective tools to help adult smokers quit. \nThe committee's review of more than 800 studies yielded many findings that were largely in line with prior assessments by other researchers. For instance, the panel found \"conclusive evidence\" that most e-cigarettes contain numerous chemicals that can be toxic. However, there was equally strong evidence that e-cigarettes contain fewer toxicants and at lower levels than regular cigarettes. \nE-cigarettes have been sold in the U.S. since at least 2007. Most devices heat a liquid nicotine solution into vapor and have been promoted to smokers as a less dangerous alternative since they don't have all the chemicals, tar or smoke of regular cigarettes. E-cigarettes and similar vaping devices have grown into a $4 billion-dollar U.S. industry with thousands of varieties of flavors and customizable products available in specialty shops and online. \nThe FDA gained authority to regulate the devices in 2016 after years of pushback from the industry. But last year the agency said it would delay the deadline for manufacturers to submit their devices for review until 2022. The decision was blasted by anti-smoking advocates who say some e-cigarette manufacturers target kids with candy and fruit flavors. \nThe FDA has signaled its intention to begin pushing U.S. consumers away from traditional cigarettes toward alternative products, such as e-cigarettes. The regulatory delay was intended, in part, to give companies more time to research their products. \nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb called the link between e-cigarette use and trying smoking in young people \"troubling.\" \n\"We need to put novel products like e-cigarettes through an appropriate series of regulatory gates to fully evaluate their risks and maximize their potential benefits,\" he said in a statement. \nSome other key takeaways and questions from the report: \n\u2014 Chemicals in e-cigarette vapor, such as formaldehyde, are capable of damaging DNA in humans. However, it's unclear if the chemicals exist at levels high enough to cause cancer. \n\u2014 Switching completely from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes significantly reduces exposure to numerous cancer-causing chemicals. \n\u2014 E-cigarettes can sometimes explode causing burns and injuries. The risk of such accidents is higher with devices that are stored improperly or contain low-quality batteries. \n\u2014 There is substantial evidence that e-cigarette vapor contains traces of metal, possibly due to the metallic coils used to heat liquid that the devices vaporize."}

U.S. crude rose 4 cents to $61.67 and also touched its highest since May 2015.\n\"There is enough support for prices with the cold in the U.S. and the geopolitical factor,\" said Petromatrix oil analyst Olivier Jakob.\nFreezing weather in the United States has spurred short-term demand, especially for heating oil.\nApart from the spike in May 2015, oil is trading at its highest since December 2014 - the month after a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to stop cutting output to support prices.\nAnalysts at JBC Energy said the price reaction to the Iranian unrest was overdone, while Swiss bank Julius Baer said prices projected \"an overly rosy picture\" that left the market at risk of profit-taking.\nOPEC, supported by Russia and other non-members, began to reduce output a year ago to remove a glut built up in the previous two years.

FILE PHOTO: A mooring station for oil tankers can be seen at the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Marine Terminal in Valdez, Alaska on August 8, 2008. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson \nThe effort to open previously off-limits acreage in the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans comes less than eight years after BP Plc\u2019s ( BP.L ) Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico - the largest in American history. The disaster caused billions of dollars in economic damage and led former President Barack Obama\u2019s to increase regulation of the industry. \nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke said on Thursday the department\u2019s draft National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2019 to 2024 would make over 90 percent of the outer continental shelf\u2019s total acreage available for leasing to drillers, a national record. \nThat would reverse the Obama administration order placing 94 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf off limits to drillers. Obama\u2019s 2017-2022 plan would be replaced by the new program when it is finalized. \n\u201cWe want to grow our nation\u2019s offshore energy industry, instead of slowly surrendering it to foreign shores,\u201d Zinke said in prepared remarks. \nHe said 25 of 26 planning areas on the Outer Continental Shelf will be considered for leasing, covering all U.S. coastlines. Proposed sales include 19 off the coast of Alaska, seven in the Pacific, 12 in the Gulf of Mexico and nine in the Atlantic Region. The last offshore lease sales for the East and West coasts were in the 1980s. \nAlaska\u2019s North Aleutian Basin\/Bristol Bay will be exempted after drilling was barred there by a previous executive order. \nZinke said the proposal was just the start of a dialogue with local stakeholders and the plan was not final. The draft will be subject to a 60-day comment period. \nThe proposal marks a huge shift from previous policy. \nWeeks before leaving office, Obama banned new oil and gas drilling in federal waters in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, protecting 115 million acres (46.5 million hectares) of waters off Alaska and 3.8 million acres (1.5 million hectares)in the Atlantic from New England to the Chesapeake Bay. \nTrump in April ordered the Interior Department to overhaul the leasing schedule to promote increased drilling. At the time, low oil prices and soaring onshore production were curtailing demand for offshore leases, raising questions about the benefits of the move. Oil prices have since risen to around three-year highs. \nIndustry groups welcomed Thursday\u2019s announcement. \n\u201cExpanding access to additional offshore reserves allows the United States to better understand where production potential exists and where capital should be invested,\u201d said Independent Petroleum Association of America senior vice president Dan Naatz. OCEANS TO OIL FIELDS \nBut lawmakers from both parties, environmental groups, governors and local business leaders said they were opposed to any effort to open coastlines to drilling rigs, citing environmental risks and threats to lucrative tourism industries. \nFlorida Republican Governor Rick Scott said he is aggressively fighting to plan. \u201cI have already asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration,\u201d he said. \nEnvironmental groups described the plan as dangerous. \u201cTrump\u2019s trying to turn our oceans into oilfields. His reckless plan would expose more wildlife and coastal communities to devastating oil spills,\u201d said Kristen Monsell, ocean program legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity. \nCoastal tourism business groups were girding for a long fight against the proposal, which comes as the Gulf Coast recovers from the Deepwater spill. The plan would open the California coast where drilling opposition has been fierce since a major oil spill in the 1960s soiled popular beaches. \nFrank Knapp, founder of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, accused the federal agency of favoring the oil and gas sector over the tourism sector. \n\u201dWhat part of the business sector are they listening to? It\u2019s certainly not small or coastal businesses,\u201d Knapp said. \nThe Defense Department has also raised concerns about opening drilling that had been banned off the eastern Gulf of Mexico, where military exercises are held.

Schumer went to meet with Trump on Friday afternoon, with no others present except Kelly and Schumer's chief of staff. They negotiated over 90 minutes while dining on cheeseburgers, according to various accounts. Republican congressional leaders did not attend the meeting. show chapters 9:03 AM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 | 02:07 \nWhite House chiefs of staff often play a major role in negotiating with Congress. Kelly, a retired Marine general, is known for his discipline, as well as his organizational and management abilities. However, he is not widely considered a political operator like Rahm Emanuel, a former congressman and Clinton administration veteran who worked for President Barack Obama, or Andrew Card, President George W. Bush's first chief of staff and a veteran of previous Republican administrations. \nYet, as immigration came to the forefront in negotiations, Kelly, a hardliner on the subject and Trump's former secretary of Homeland Security, became more involved in influencing policy and the president's positions. In recent weeks, Kelly has participated in immigration talks with the No. 2 ranking House and Senate members on both sides of the aisle. \nAhead of the shutdown, Schumer and most of his caucus were threatening to vote against a House-passed stopgap spending bill that would keep the government open until Feb. 16 and reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program for six years. They wanted to reach a deal on an immigration proposal that would shield hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation, which would include increased border security funding and changes to extended family migration and the visa \"lottery\" system to appease Republicans. \nEarly Saturday morning, Schumer said he offered terms to Trump that he thought could result in a deal, even yielding on including funding for the president's proposed barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border. While neither the president nor the senator left the meeting saying they had a deal, both cited progress afterward. According to the New York Times , Schumer thought he had coaxed Trump into agreeing to a three- to four-day extension of funding, which would include money for disaster relief and health-care provisions, to enable sides to reach a more long-lasting deal. \n\"In my heart, I thought we might have a deal tonight,\" Schumer said. \nKelly, who has participated in rounds of congressional negotiations on funding, then reassured Republicans that Trump had not struck a deal without them, as some had feared he could. He called Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn , R-Texas, to say Trump and Schumer had not reached a solution, according to Politico . \n\"He told me that the president told Schumer to come back and talk to [House Speaker] Ryan and [Senate Majority Leader] McConnell. [Trump] wasn't going to get in the middle of it,\" Cornyn said, according to the news outlet. \"Sounds like Gen. Kelly had it under control.\" \nLater in the day after more exchanges between the White House and Schumer, Kelly called the senator to say the framework of the agreement he proposed was too liberal for Republicans, a person familiar with the call said. In fact, Kelly had an extensive list of objections to the potential deal, according to the Times. \nNearly all of Schumer's caucus \u2014 and four Republicans, too \u2014 voted against the House-passed bill late Friday . Congress could not reach a deal before funding lapsed on Saturday. \nSenators on both sides of the aisle \u2014 particularly Lindsey Graham of South Carolina \u2014 have expressed frustration with apparent inconsistency from Trump on what he wants in an immigration deal . Democrats and most Republicans in Congress support some type of legislation to shield the immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children.

Analysts\u2019 average estimate for the model 3 deliveries was about 2,900 units, according to a Bloomberg News survey . \nDespite making \u201cmajor progress\u201d addressing Model 3 production bottlenecks, the company has pushed back its target of producing 5,000 Model 3 sedans per week to the end of the second quarter. This is the second time Tesla has punted on its 5,000-per-week milestone. \nShares were down 1.65% in after-hours trading. \nTesla said it will have a more gradual ramp through the first quarter \u201cto focus on quality and efficiency rather than simply pushing for the highest possible volume in the shortest period of time.\u201d The company will likely end the first quarter at a weekly rate of about 2,500 Model 3 vehicles. \u201cWe intend to achieve the 5,000 per week milestone by the end of Q2,\u201d Tesla said in its report. \nThere is some evidence that the ramp up lately has not been so gradual, or that perhaps some bottlenecks have been removed, causing a sudden increase in production. Of the 2,425 Model 3 vehicles produced in the fourth quarter, 793 of them (or nearly 33%) were made in the last seven working days of the quarter, according to Tesla. \n\u201cAs a result of the significant growth in our production rate, we made as many Model 3\u2019s since Dec. 9 as we did in the more than four months of Model 3 production up to that point,\u201d Tesla said, explaining that this is why it wasn\u2019t able to deliver many of these cars during the holiday season, just before the quarter ended. \nTesla said it reduced production of its Model S and Model X in the fourth quarter to put more of its workers on the Model 3. \n\u201cTesla would have been better served had it not announced such lofty plans for its production ramp-up,\u201d Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Autotrader said in an email. \u201cThe company has now said it is focused on quality versus volume, which is the right focus.

Young and Crippen flew the first orbital mission of NASA's space shuttle program aboard the Columbia. NASA\/Handout via REUTERS\/File Photo Young, a former U.S. Navy test pilot, in 1972 became the ninth of 12 people ever to set foot on the moon.\n\u201cWe\u2019re saddened by the loss of astronaut John Young,\u201d the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said in a statement on Twitter.\nThe time and cause of Young\u2019s death was not immediately clear.\nYoung became one of the most accomplished astronauts in the history of the U.S. space program. He flew into space twice during NASA\u2019s Gemini program in the mid-1960s, twice on the Apollo lunar missions and twice on space shuttles in the 1980s.\nHe retired in 2004 after 42 years with the U.S. space agency.\nThe Apollo 16 mission in April 1972, his fourth space flight, took Young to the lunar surface.\nAs mission commander, he and crewmate Charles Duke explored the moon\u2019s Descartes Highlands region, gathering 200 pounds (90 kg) of rock and soil samples and driving more than 16 miles (26 km) in the lunar rover to sites such as Spook Crater.\nRecalling his lunar exploits, Young told the Houston Chronicle in 2004: \u201cOne-sixth gravity on the surface of the moon is just delightful. It\u2019s not like being in zero gravity, you know. You can drop a pencil in zero gravity and look for it for three days. In one-sixth gravity, you just look down and there it is.\u201d\nYoung\u2019s first time in space came in 1965 with the Gemini 3 mission that took him and astronaut Gus Grissom into Earth orbit in the first two-man U.S. space jaunt.\nIt was on this mission that Young pulled his sandwich stunt, which did not make NASA brass happy but certainly pleased Grissom, the recipient of the snack.\nAstronaut Wally Schirra, who was not flying on the mission, bought the corned beef sandwich on rye bread from a delicatessen in Cocoa Beach, Florida, and asked Young to give it to Grissom in space. During the flight, as they discussed the food provided for the mission, Young handed Grissom the sandwich.\nNASA later rebuked Young for the antics, which generated criticism from lawmakers and the media, but his career did not suffer.\nHis May 1969 Apollo 10 mission served as a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for the historic Apollo 11 mission two months later in which Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon. Young and his crew undertook each aspect of that subsequent mission except for an actual moon landing.\nYoung\u2019s fifth space mission was as commander of the inaugural flight of NASA\u2019s first space shuttle, Columbia, in 1981. He became the first person to fly six space missions in 1983, when he commanded Columbia on the first Spacelab trek, with the crew performing more than 70 scientific experiments.\nHe never went to space again. Young had been due to command a 1986 flight that was canceled after the explosion of the shuttle Challenger earlier that year. He ended up as the only person to fly on space shuttle, Apollo and Gemini missions.\nYoung was born on Sept. 24, 1930, in San Francisco and grew up in Orlando, Florida. After receiving a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1952, he entered the Navy and graduated from its test pilot school. NASA picked him in 1962 for its astronaut program.\nReporting and writing by Will Dunham; Additional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Bill Trott and Lisa Von Ahn\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}

FILE PHOTO - Head of the North Korean delegation, Ri Son Gwon shakes hands with South Korean counterpart Cho Myoung-gyon as they exchange documents after their meeting at the truce village of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, South Korea. Yonhap via REUTERS \n\u201cWe had started in a good spirit but this came to an icky mood,\u201d North Korea\u2019s lead delegate Ri Son Gwon complained in closing remarks. \nHis rebuke highlights the challenges that lie ahead for Seoul after the 11 hours of talks yielded agreements to hold military talks and facilitate North Korea\u2019s participation in next month\u2019s Winter Olympics in South Korea. \nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in attained his immediate goal of getting North Korea to participate in the games - and reducing the chance its leader Kim Jong Un would disrupt the event with another missile or nuclear test. But turning the winter thaw into a longer-term detente will be far more daunting. \nTo do so, Moon must navigate a volatile mix of mutually exclusive policies, including North Korea\u2019s stance that its nuclear arsenal is non-negotiable and Washington\u2019s equally strident insistence that complete denuclearisation is the only acceptable outcome. \nSeoul has proposed that the two Koreas make a show of unity by marching together at the Pyeongchang Olympics. The last time they did that was in January 2007 at the Asian Winter Games in Changchun, China, just three months after North Korea conducted its first nuclear test. \nThe first U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang followed that nuclear test and over the next 12 years, international sanctions ramped up along with North Korea\u2019s increasingly sophisticated missile and nuclear tests, a cycle that has left Pyongyang increasingly isolated. Along the way, six-country talks aimed at dismantling North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme became moribund. \nParticipation in the Olympics would help ease the North\u2019s isolation. And Pyongyang may hope South Korea could resume desperately needed economic aid at some point. Moon, after all, was once an advocate of former president Kim Dae Jung\u2019s \u201csunshine policy\u201d of reconciliation with the North. \n\u201cLARGER ISSUES\u201d \nRi said he would not discuss North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme with the South because its nuclear bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) are aimed \u201cthoroughly\u201d at the United States, not at its \u201cbrethren\u201d in the South. \nSeoul believes improved inter-Korean ties and a series of steps agreed on Tuesday could pave the way for discussion of a \u201cfundamental resolution\u201d of the nuclear issue in the future, the South\u2019s unification ministry said on Wednesday. \nBut the two Korea\u2019s can do little themselves about denuclearisation \u201cwithout having the United States on board,\u201d said Hwang In-sung, secretary-general of the secretariat of the presidential National Unification Advisory council in Seoul. \nSouth Korea should not repeat past failures where seemingly vigorous talks fell apart and ties froze in a flash, he said. \n\u201cGiven the mistrust and high bars set up by both North Korea and the U.S., we will need to drive the experience from Pyeongchang when it\u2019s over, in a way that contributes to the opening of nuclear negotiations\u201d, Hwang told Reuters. \nThe two Koreas initiated sports diplomacy in 1957 in an effort to form a unified team for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. That effort, however, ended in failure. \nCulture and sports diplomacy between them since then has followed the ups and downs of their Cold War-era relations. The two countries remain technically at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armed truce that has yet to be replaced with a peace agreement. \n\u201cSports exchanges have their own limits given the complex dynamics surrounding the Korean Peninsula, but they can help rally public support and provide a boost for other serious issues to go forward\u201d, said Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. SPORTS AND AID \nA high point came in 2000, when athletes from both sides marched together under a single flag depicting the Korean Peninsula during the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Sydney. \nEven back then, Seoul\u2019s offer of economic aid in return to facilitate such events was a source of contention in South Korea, which has lived with military threats from the North for decades. \n\u201cWhile the hope is certainly that these things will lead to further political developments between the two, such cooperation has often ended without any larger-scale issues being solved\u201d, said Benjamin Silberstein, associate scholar at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia. \n\u201cThere are few signs to suggest that this time is any different, but it is still too soon to tell\u201d.

He plans to reopen it this summer, around the same time the former Trump Taj Mahal casino will reopen nearby under the Hard Rock brand.\nThe former Revel will be called the Ocean Resort Casino. Deifik called the purchase \"a dream come true.\"\nBut the news raises a sobering question for a gambling resort that only recently regained its equilibrium following the shutdown of five of its 12 casinos: Might the sudden reintroduction of two large casinos create the same conditions that led to the wave of shutdowns in the first place?\nRevel's sale was finalized Thursday afternoon, during a blizzard, a fitting development for a project with a turbulent history. It cost $2.4 billion to build, yet lasted just over two years before shutting down, never having come close to turning a profit.\nDeifik is undeterred.\n\"We are incredibly excited that we were able to take advantage of the opportunity to acquire this tremendous property at a time when Atlantic City is seeing great economic strides,\" he said. \"The former Revel property opened at a time when Atlantic City was still in economic recovery, and operationally it just did not cater to the customer base for this destination.\"\nOne new amenity Deifik plans is a sports book facility that would operate if New Jersey wins its U.S. Supreme Court case to legalize sports betting.\nHe said the casino will employ 2,500 to 3,000 people. It has 1,399 hotel rooms. The gambling area will offer 100 table games and 2,200 slot machines.\nDeifik said he plans to bring back some of the restaurants that were popular at Revel, along with some new ones, including an Asian noodle bar. He also plans a high-end players' club.\nDeifik is president and CEO of Integrated Properties, which owns 103 commercial properties in five states, including the Hyatt Grand Champions Resort in Palm Springs, California, and several office and retail centers in the Denver and Phoenix areas.\nAnalysts are mixed on whether Atlantic City's seven operating casinos can handle two more competitors. Some say the reopenings could hurt smaller casinos and possibly lead one or more to close, but others are optimistic the new offerings \u2014 particularly the music-themed, globally known Hard Rock brand \u2014 can bring new customers who otherwise would not have traveled to Atlantic City.\nRevel opened in 2012, with no less an aim than to rewrite the rules of success in Atlantic City's casino market. It eschewed bus-riding, buffet-patronizing day trippers in favor of a hoped-for clientele of Wall Street traders, hedge fund execs and the highest of high-rollers. It was the only Atlantic City to ban smoking.\nNone of it worked.\nThe $13 million in casino winnings it took in its first month ranked it near the bottom of Atlantic City's 12 casinos \u2014 a spot it would occupy for its two-year existence. It went bankrupt twice, choking on massive debt it couldn't come close to paying, and closed on Sept. 2, 2014.\nStraub, a Polo-loving multimillionaire, bought it for $82 million from bankruptcy court and then fought with state officials over whether he needed a casino license. He said Monday he bought Revel \"to keep and not to sell.\" But he quickly tangled with government regulations at the local and state levels that he said frustrated his plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to help redevelop Atlantic City.\nStraub sold the property for $118 million more than he paid for it, but he incurred large expenses while keeping it closed.\nBut what Straub described as burdensome red tape are rules that all Atlantic City's other casino owners comply with. And a significant portion of his expenses involved legal fees incurred in fighting government regulations with which he disagreed.\nStraub said he retains more than 60 Atlantic City properties, with which he plans to \"be a spark for catalyzing positive economic movement in Atlantic City.\"\nThe closest he got to reopening Revel came with the partial installation of a rope-climbing course in what used to be the casino's port cochere area. But even that modest venture failed and was ripped out while half-finished.\nBefore settling on a reopened casino and hotel, Straub floated a wide variety of proposed uses for the property. They included a water park; condominiums; a health-themed spa; an equestrian facility; a so-called \"tower of geniuses\" where the world's top minds would gather to tackle society's problems, and a temporary home for Syrian refugees."}

The bacteria can be found in animal products including cold cut meats, poultry and unpasteurised milk, as well as fresh fruits and vegetables. \nThe disease can cause flu-like symptoms and diarrhoea, and in more severe cases spread from the intestine to the blood, causing bloodstream infections, or to the central nervous system, causing meningitis. \nAnelich said a listeriosis strain known as ST6 had been identified in nine out of 10 of the South African cases. \nThat should make tracing the source easier, \u201cbecause now we know that it probably originates from one processing facility\u201d. \nA health department official said the strain was not drug-resistant and that the deaths were due to delays in diagnosis, meaning cases were not treated in time.

The world's largest futures exchange, CME , and its competitor, Cboe , both introduced bitcoin futures that month as well. Many saw the move as a step toward legitimizing bitcoin as an asset class, and paving the way for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. \nIn the letter, Grantham also included a chart illustrating how large and how rapid the bitcoin price surge has been in the last two years compared with other historical bubbles.\n\"As you can see, Bitcoin dwarfs even the legendary South Sea Bubble!\" he said. \"Having no clear fundamental value and largely unregulated markets, coupled with a storyline conducive to delusions of grandeur, makes this more than anything we can find in the history books the very essence of a bubble.\"\nOther well-known investors have said for months that bitcoin is in a bubble, and compared it to the tulip bulb mania or speculation in Beanie Babies. J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the digital currency a \"fraud.\" \nBut none of the criticism has deterred bitcoin's surge so far, or prevented others from predicting further gains.\nAnd although bitcoin has struggled in the last two weeks to stay above $15,000, prices of other cryptocurrencies have surged dramatically. The market value of all cryptocurrencies has multiplied roughly 38 times from this time last year to more than $770 billion Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap.\nFormer Fortress hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz has also said cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are the \"biggest bubble of our lifetimes,\" with a lot of money to be made on the way up . \nFrom what's stated in his letter, Grantham would rather look at the bitcoin craze as one of the early signs that the stock market may be nearing the end of its yearslong rally. \n\"My favorite advice once again: Keep an eye on what the TVs at lunchtime eateries are showing. When most have talking heads yammering about Amazon , Tencent , and Bitcoin and not Patriot replays \u2013 just as late 1999 featured the latest in Pets.com \u2013 we are probably down to the last few months.\"\nIn this environment, Grantham said \"own as much Emerging Market Equity as your career or business risk can tolerate, and some EAFE,\" referring to developed markets outside North America."}

Now it's time to fix\u2026\"\nHe also acknowledged via Twitter the irony of sharing his criticisms on one of the platforms he was blaming.\nFadell says on his own LinkedIn page that he was an \"advisor to the CEO\" at Apple from November 2008 to March of 2010, during which time Steve Jobs was the CEO. ( Jobs resigned in August 2011 .) Also, Fadell was the Senior Vice President in charge of the iPod division from Jan 2001 through March 2010. He has been called one of the \"fathers of the iPod\" for his work on the personal music player. Fadell also founded and was the CEO of home regulation system Nest and the marketing company Fuse.\nFadell recommends big tech turn over usage data to third parties who can build apps to monitor the amount of time being spent looking at screens.\nRead the salient points:\nUK adults spend 8+ hrs on screens\/day, children 6.5 hrs. Don't ignore the link betw social media use & depression. 34% of people checked Facebook in the last 10 minutes.\nAdmitting you have an addiction is Step 1.\nWe need to control our own environment & we need information:\nApple Watches, Google Phones, Facebook, Twitter - they've gotten so good at getting us to go for another click, another dopamine hit. They now have a responsibility & need to start helping us track & manage our digital addictions across all usages - phone, laptop, TV etc.\nThey're the only ones who can do this -\nThey need to give access to that information to 3rd-party apps, so that we can manage & limit our time on them, control notifications, etc. There will a lot of great startups that will create useful tools to help us become balanced - digital & analog - again\u2026\nWith (or without) these tools, it's up to us to act:\nThe comments from Fadell come as consumer addiction to technology is top of mind.\nTwo prominent investors in Apple \u2014 Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, or Calstrs \u2014 sent a letter to the Cupertino-based tech behemoth on Saturday pointing out the extent to which young people are addicted to their smartphones. (Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, or Calstrs own $2 billion worth of Apple stock.)\n\"More than 10 years after the iPhone's release, it is a clich\u00e9 to point out the ubiquity of Apple's devices among children and teenagers, as well as the attendant growth in social media use by this group. What is less well known is that there is a growing body of evidence that, for at least some of the most frequent young users, this may be having unintentional negative consequences,\" the letter says.\nApple has responded to the letter. Since 2008, parental controls have been available for many Apple products, the company points out.\n\"Apple has always looked out for kids, and we work hard to create powerful products that inspire, entertain, and educate children while also helping parents protect them online. We lead the industry by offering intuitive parental controls built right into the operating system,\" Apple says in a statement shared with CNBC Make It .\n\"We think deeply about how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them. We take this responsibility very seriously and we are committed to meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations, especially when it comes to protecting kids.\"\nApple did not respond to the claim that adults are also addicted to their technology.\nTwitter declined to comment.\nFacebook and Google had not responded to request for comment by the time this story was published.\nFadell pressed Apple to respond to the claim for adults, too.\nIndeed, Adam Alter, an associate professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, wrote a book, \" Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked, \" making the case that in addition to kids, adults are addicted to technology.\n\"We're biologically prone to getting hooked on these sorts of experiences. If you put someone in front of a slot machine, their brain will look qualitatively the same as when they take heroin. If you're someone who compulsively plays video games \u2014 not everyone, but people who are addicted to a particular game \u2014 the minute you load up your computer, your brain will look like that of a substance abuser,\" Alter tells the New York Times . \"I find it interesting that the late Steve Jobs said in a 2010 interview that his own children didn't use iPads.\"\nAlter uses himself as an example: \"I'm addicted to email. I can't stop checking it. I can't go to bed at night if I haven't cleared my inbox. I'll keep my phone next to my bed, much as I try not to,\" says Alter.\n\"The technology is designed to hook us that way. Email is bottomless. Social media platforms are endless. Twitter? The feed never really ends. You could sit there 24 hours a day and you'll never get to the end. And so you come back for more and more,\" he tells the Times.\nAnd according to Fadell's tweets, it's not hard to implement tools that would allow consumers to moderate their usage. He knows it, and so does Apple, he says.\nThx to my friends @apple for your 1st response. It's not about only kids, adults need them for themselves too. U & I know it's technically EASY to build usage info & control tools.

This is significant, according to GDAX, because such tools are a foundation of sophisticated trading strategies, and could entice more major financial players to enter the crypto markets. \nIn announcing the news, the companies said the new tools would increase the reach of GDAX\u2019s platform, which could in turn expand the volume of crypto-trading across the world. \n\u201cWith 19 of the top 20 futures commission merchants as distribution partners, TT users are some of the largest futures and commodity traders in the world. Its connectivity stretches to nearly 45 markets, including the futures markets of the CME Group, Deutsche Boerse, Intercontinental Exchange and Nasdaq. Through this partnership, TT users will be able to view market data, submit orders, and leverage a market-leading suite of charting and automated trading tools to trade cryptocurrencies on GDAX,\u201d the company said in a statement. \nThe tie-up between GDAX and TT comes after a group of exchanges began offering futures contracts for bitcoin and other crypto-currencies in December. The availability of these contracts was expected to help temper the extreme volatility that has long characterized the crypto markets but, so far, they have done little to temper the price swings. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. \nMeanwhile, the Wall Street Journal of Wednesday reported that hedge funds are growing wary of \u201ccryptomania\u201d amid an ongoing slump in prices. \nGDAX General Manager Adam White tells Fortune the futures market is working as expected, but that it\u2019s too early for the contracts to have had an impact on stabilizing volatility. He says this is in part because major traders have yet to have access to a full suite of tools to fully take advantage of the futures market. \n\u201cThe volatility is why traders are waiting for an offering like this [with TT],\u201d White says. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for a safe discovery process to happen quickly and efficiently, which could draw more major financial players into the crypto arena.\u201d \nRick Lane, the CEO of TT, echoed the sentiment, saying the GDAX-TT partnership will for the first time let big traders have the tools they need to manage risk in the crypto market, and is likely to draw in more major investors. \nThe partnership also comes at a time when Coinbase is making a concerted play to attract institutional investors by offering features like margin trading a custodian service .

In September, Chao announced the first set of revisions to the guidelines that were unveiled by the Obama administration and now plans a revised version by summer. \nChao said her goal was to eliminate \u201cunnecessary obstacles to the development and integration of new technology. Our approach will be tech-neutral and flexible \u2014 not top-down, or command and control.\u201d She added the government would \u201cnot be in the business of picking winners or losers, or favoring one form of technology over another.\u201d \nIn October, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, said it was looking for input on how to remove regulatory roadblocks to self-driving cars. \nNHTSA said in a report that it wanted to find any \u201cunnecessary regulatory barriers\u201d to self-driving cars \u201cparticularly those that are not equipped with controls for a human driver.\u201d U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao speaks ahead of Press Days of the North American International Auto Show at Cobo Center in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 14, 2018.

But it could take the agency years to complete the research and finalize rule changes. \nAutomakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle. The agency said in 2016 that current regulations posed \u201csignificant\u201d regulatory hurdles to vehicles without human controls. \nEarlier this month, the Transportation Department published notices requesting comments to identify barriers to innovation including one from NHTSA, two from the Federal Transit Administration to address autonomous bus technology and barriers and one from the Federal Highway Administration to address autonomous infrastructure technology. Chao said more were planned. \nLast week, GM filed a petition with NHTSA requesting an exemption to have a small number of autonomous vehicles operate in a ride-share program without steering wheels or human drivers. \nChao said the \u201cdepartment will review this petition, and give it responsible and careful consideration.\u201d \nChao, who was meeting with automakers privately in Detroit at the show, has made self-driving cars a top priority. She held meetings on the subject in Silicon Valley last year, including with Google co-founder Sergey Brin. \nOn Sunday, she urged automakers and tech companies to do more to reassure skeptical Americans about the technology. \u201cThey need to be brought along,\u201d she said of the public. \u201cConsumer acceptance will be a constraint to growth in this industry.\u201d Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Peter Cooney"}

Kwan was the last one to tackle the blindfolded Deng, while Lam \u201cgot physical\u201d with Deng and fled before police arrived, court documents said. \nJudge Margherita Patti-Worthington could sentence the four to up to 27 years in prison, although state guidelines call for 22 to 36 months. \nThe fraternity has two chapters in the state, an active one at Pennsylvania State University in University Park and an inactive one at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburg. \nIn a separate case, 26 members of Pennsylvania State University\u2019s Beta Theta Pi fraternity face charges including involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault, hazing and furnishing alcoholic beverages to a minor under 21 after the death of Timothy Piazza, 19.

That downsizing leaves unused footage, which Mansell said would benefit from traffic-generating retailers like those that sell food.\n\"If we had our preference, we are going first after well-capitalized companies, and preferably ones that have high traffic in grocery and convenience,\" Mansell said.\nThe Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based retailer has already identified \"a whole list of partners\" to roll out across a number of its stores.\n\"We are more apt to identify strong partners and then build a pathway with them through this pilot phase.\"\nFor potential Kohl's partners, the department store brings with it strong real estate, big parking lots and its own traffic. A food and apparel duo would be able to compete against a number of retailers employing similar strategies, like Target and even Walmart .\nNot all of Kohl's roughly 300 right-sized stores will necessarily lease space, at least at the onset. Kohl's may partner with several retailers in group rollouts and it could also partner with some as a one-off. Kohl's would consider partnerships with competitors, Mansell said.\nHe declined to say whether Whole Foods is one of its in-store partners. Kohl's already has a partnership with Whole Food's new owner, Amazon , through which it sells Amazon products and accepts its returns. \n\"It's not about Whole Foods, Aldi, or anybody else \u2026 we want a partner, ideally in food or convenience, to help drive traffic,\" said Mansell. The company plans to announce news about these efforts on its next earnings call, which is scheduled for March 1.\nRetailers are increasingly looking to unlikely bedfellows to broaden their offerings and rethink their store space. As in-store sales decline, smaller stores help retailers more profitably maintain their physical presence. Having stores helps with marketing and alleviating the cost of shipping and returns. Partners, meanwhile, can bring in new traffic.\nLord & Taylor-owner the Hudson's Bay Co. recently signed a deal with WeWork to lease some of its retail space to the office-sharing company.\nKohl's has said its smaller store concepts have allowed it to improve profitability and lower its inventory levels. The latter is important as it lessens the risk of unsold clothes, which hurt profit margins.\nLike its peers, it has also been opening stand-alone small-store concepts. This past quarter, it opened four new 35,000-square-foot stores, bringing the total up to 12. Target has plans to open 130 of its small-format stores by 2019 . European grocer Lidl, which is embarking on a U.S. expansion, recently shifted its focus to include smaller-format stores.\nBeyond focusing on improving the profitability of its store space, Kohl's has been focusing on other initiatives, which could include acquisitions, Mansell said. Potential deals are unlikely to include department store peers. \n\"Kohl's is not taking anything off the table. We have a healthy balance sheet and we can actually act,\" said Mansell, who plans to retire in May . \nBut, he said, any deal would have to generate more traffic to Kohl's stores. \"To just a bolt on a business, what does that do?\""}

The country already lagged regional peers such as Colombia and Brazil, both of which have made strides in setting up independent prosecutors.\nThe report also noted the \u201clow level of effectiveness\u201d in prosecutions and seizures and an \u201cextremely low level of effectiveness\u201d in punishing corruption.\n\u201cWe are working with the specialized offices (that target money laundering) where we are strengthening protocols,\u201d Elias said, adding that government agencies were also working to implement so-called parallel investigations.\nThe FATF report underscored that Mexico was largely failing to carry out parallel money laundering investigations to match probes of organized crime, drug trafficking and corruption.\nThe FATF recommends such parallel investigations, and its report on Mexico underscored haphazard, uneven results of current investigations, noting low conviction rates and tiny seizures of assets compared with the amount of illicit proceeds that are generated in Mexico.\nElias noted that the FATF report recognized Mexico had improved its legal framework to tackle laundering and credited the country for the recent the emphasis on improving investigations.\nElias pointed to last year\u2019s extradition of Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, Mexico\u2019s most notorious kingpin, to the United States as a success. He said Mexico was continuing to work with the United States in order to identify Guzman\u2019s assets north and south of the border.\nHe also noted that during the last two months Mexico, Colombia and the United States have been working on developing a new computerized method to share information.\n\u201cThis will allow us to be much more efficient in investigations and also in the detection of assets, which for us is fundamental to fight the financial structures of all criminal organizations,\u201d Elias said.\nMexico and the United States have been quietly increasing cooperation to fight heroin trafficking since last year. High-level U.S. state department officials have told Reuters that the United States has offered to help fund Mexico\u2019s efforts to eradicate opium poppies.\nHowever, Elias said U.S. aid to Mexico to fight drug trafficking and improve its legal system was small compared with the spending by Mexico.\n\u201cMexico has indicated that it has sufficient resources to be able to combat these criminal phenomena in a frontal manner,\u201d he said.\nEditing by Lisa Shumaker\n "}

As both show signs of creeping higher, some market watchers see the combination as a potential headwind for stocks.\n\nInflation and the 10-year Treasury yield rising together are of particular importance to Mike Binger, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments.

I expect the two offers to compete on the market from mid-February,\u201d the source said. \nAtlantia needs to trump Hochtief\u2019s counter-bid, made in October, and is widely expected to sweeten its bid early this year. \nIn December a source said that after the Spanish ministers\u2019 intervention, Atlantia had begun preparing for legal action in case its bid was blocked. \nDLA Piper and Italy\u2019s Gianni, Origoni, Grippo, Cappelli & Partners are among Atlantia\u2019s legal advisers while Credit Suisse, Mediobanca and Santander are its main banks. \nFreshfields and Linklaters are advising ACS and Hochtief on legal matters alongside a pool of investment banks led by JPMorgan and Lazard. \nAbertis has retained Citi and boutique bank AZ Capital while Spanish law firm Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez Abogados is its legal adviser.

(NASDAQ:AKBA), a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering innovative therapies to patients with kidney disease through the biology of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), today announced positive top-line results from its Phase 2 study of vadadustat in patients with anemia associated with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (DD-CKD) in Japan. The results are consistent with findings from previous studies of vadadustat. Akebia\u2019s partner, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (MTPC), is conducting a Phase 3 study of non-dialysis dependent (NDD-CKD) patients in Japan and, based upon the data announced today, is expected to begin Phase 3 studies in DD-CKD patients in Japan in 2018. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement with MTPC, Akebia will receive $10 million in milestone payments in conjunction with the start of the Phase 3 studies.\n\u201cThese positive top-line Phase 2 results in dialysis-dependent patients in Japan follow our recently-announced positive top-line Phase 2 results in Japanese patients who were not dialysis-dependent,\u201d said Rita Jain, M.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Akebia. \u201cThe data from both studies provide further confirmation of vadadustat\u2019s potential to help patients, and we look forward to the results of the Phase 3 program in Japan by our partner, MTPC, and the potential launch of vadadustat in 2020.\u201d\nThe double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding Phase 2 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of orally-administered vadadustat in Japanese patients with anemia associated with DD-CKD. This 16-week study evaluated 60 patients during a 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose period and a 10-week active treatment, dose adjustment and maintenance period.\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was mean hemoglobin change from baseline to week 6 comparing vadadustat to placebo. Statistically significant improvements in the primary endpoint were observed in the vadadustat groups, 150 mg (p = 0.0004), 300 mg (p < 0.0001), and 600 mg (p < 0.0001), compared to placebo. The data indicate a dose-response for vadadustat.\nThe incidence of adverse events during the 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose period in the vadadustat groups (150 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg) and placebo was 53%, 73%, 40%, and 40%, respectively. During the 16-week study and the 2-week follow-up period, the most common adverse events reported were nasopharyngitis (20%), diarrhea (13.3%), and headache (10%). Serious adverse events were consistent with prior studies and included 10 SAEs in 7 patients, none of which were considered drug related. No deaths were reported.\nAkebia and MTPC plan to present the data from the NDD-CKD and DD-CKD Phase 2 studies conducted in Japan at an upcoming scientific meeting and publish the results in a peer-reviewed journal.\nAbout Vadadustat\nVadadustat is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilizer currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of anemia related to chronic kidney disease. Vadadustat exploits the same mechanism of action used by the body to adapt naturally to lower oxygen availability associated with a moderate increase in altitude. At higher altitudes, the body responds to lower oxygen availability with increased production of HIF, which coordinates the interdependent processes of iron mobilization and erythropoietin production to increase red blood cell production and, ultimately, improve oxygen delivery.\nAbout Akebia Therapeutics\nAkebia Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, focused on delivering innovative therapies to patients with kidney disease through hypoxia-inducible factor biology. Akebia's lead product candidate, vadadustat, is an oral, investigational therapy in development for the treatment of anemia related to chronic kidney disease in both non-dialysis and dialysis patients and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any regulatory authority. Akebia's global Phase 3 program for vadadustat, which includes the PRO 2 TECT studies for non-dialysis patients with anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease and the INNO 2 VATE studies for dialysis-dependent patients, is currently ongoing. In addition, the Company has initiated the Phase 2 FO 2 RWARD study of vadadustat in dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients who are hyporesponsive to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), and expects to commence the Phase 3 TRILO 2 GY study to further evaluate a three-times-weekly dosing regimen for vadadustat.

He declined to discuss potential or pending deals. \nLuxe\u2019s operations team, staffed with some of Statoil\u2019s former Bakken Shale engineers, has yet to actually drill any wells together because the company quickly sold its initial acreage to Diamondback. That does not seem to bother Irving, Texas-based NGP. \n\u201cWe have an extremely high degree of confidence in the technical and operational skill set of this team,\u201d NGP\u2019s Tony Weber said in a statement. \nIdeally, Langford said, Luxe would quickly begin drilling any acreage it acquires with the fresh NGP funds. \nThe company will have to contend with spiking land costs in the Permian, considered one of the most-active oilfields in the world and one expected to grow more active with oil prices now trading about $60 per barrel. Oasis Petroleum Inc , for example, paid $946 million last month for 20,300 acres, or roughly $46,000 per acre. \nThe rising land costs could dent Luxe\u2019s plans to amass land holdings of as much as three times what Oasis acquired, though Langford said he was not dissuaded. \n\u201cI have a team of roughly 30 that is always looking around at potential deals,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the economics are right, they\u2019ll know.\u201d (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by David Gregorio)"}

The service has roughly 8 million streamers and 250,000 live streams a day, said the companies in a statement. \nGoogle will help the Chinese firm expand its services to target more overseas viewers, it said. \nLive stream gaming platforms are a popular form of e-sports in China, part of a growing industry that involves competitive game play viewed by spectators.

It represents the gravest challenge yet to the 35-year rule of President Paul Biya who will seek re-election this year. \nJulius Ayuk Tabe, the Nigeria-based chairman of the Governing Council of Ambazonia separatist movement, was taken into custody alongside six others at a hotel in Abuja on Friday, said an official in the west African country and a member of the separatist group in Cameroon. \nBilateral relations have been strained by a separatist movement in Cameroon that has clashed with the Cameroonian army and forced thousands to flee violence by travelling across the border to Nigeria. \nCameroonian troops last month crossed into Nigeria in pursuit of rebels without seeking Nigerian authorization, causing diplomatic wrangling behind the scenes. \nSeparatists, including armed radical elements, seek an independent state for the nation\u2019s Anglophone regions they call Ambazonia. \nA Nigerian official said Tabe and six of his supporters were placed in custody at around 7 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Friday. \u201cThey were having a meeting at Nera Hotels in Abuja,\u201d the official said on condition of anonymity. \nThe official did not know who rounded up the separatists. \nA member of the separatist group based in Cameroon, who wanted to remain anonymous, said the people were taken into custody. \nThe separatist group later issued a statement saying that Tabe and six others were taken from Nera Hotels by Cameroonian gunmen in an \u201cillegal abduction.\u201d Reuters was unable to independently verify the allegation. \nThe unrest in Cameroon began in November, when English-speaking teachers and lawyers in the Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon, frustrated with having to work in French, took to the streets calling for reforms and greater autonomy. \nFrench is the official language for most of Cameroon but English is spoken in two regions that border Nigeria. \nProtests by separatists prompted a violent crackdown by Cameroon\u2019s military last year in which troops opened fire on demonstrators.

Some workers will receive $1,000, but only if they've served at the company for at least 20 years. The announcement came on the heels of new tax legislation. Walmart also revealed it would be shuttering dozens of its warehouse club stores across the country. Getty Images A Wal-Mart employee pushes grocery carts at a store in Miami. \nWalmart announced on Thursday its plans to give out bonuses of up to $1,000 to some of its employees, following the passage of new tax legislation that slashes corporate tax rates. \nHowever, the amount each hourly worker receives will depend on his or her time with the company. (See a chart below for details.) \nIn total, the big-box retailer and world's largest private employer will spend $400 million in fiscal 2018 to fund the one-time pay outs. Walmart said an employee's qualification for a bonus will be determined before the end of the month, \"and payments will be paid as quickly as practical thereafter.\" \nHere's a breakdown of what employees should expect to receive: \nMore than 20 years of service: $1,000 \n15 to 19 years of service: $750 \n10 to 14 years of service: $400 \n5 to 9 years of service: $300 \n2 to 4 years of service: $250 \nLess than 2 years of service: $200 \nAlso on Thursday, Walmart revealed it would be shuttering 63 of its Sam's Club wholesale stores across the country. Some of the stores would close immediately. \nThe company said those workers impacted by the closures would still be eligible for bonuses. \nWhile many employees, customers and analysts alike were startled by the abrupt store closure news , Walmart has largely been applauded for opting to give back a portion of its tax savings to workers. \n\"Providing employees with a bonus and better wages should also help drive additional sales, and also allow the company to remain competitive in a 17-year-low unemployment rate labor market,\" Susquehana analyst Bill Dreher wrote in a note to clients. \n\"This represents less than 20% of Walmart's tax savings which we expect will be invested in merchandise price reductions , employee training, omnichannel and other technology investments as well as share repurchases,\" Dreher said.

Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and other software makers have issued patches to protect against the vulnerabilities. \nIntel may be on the hook for costs stemming from lawsuits claiming that the patches would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, and big customers will likely seek compensation from Intel for any software or hardware fixes they make, security experts told Reuters. \n\u201cThe potential liability is big for Intel,\u201d said Eric Johnson, dean of Vanderbilt University\u2019s Owen Graduate School of Management. \u201cEverybody will be scrambling over the next few days to figure out just how big it is.\u201d \nInvestors need more details about the flaws so they can assess their impact on Intel and other technology companies, said Tim Ghriskey, an investment manager with Inverness Counsel in New York. \n\u201cIt remains to be seen whether Intel has higher exposure than its rivals,\u201d said Ghriskey, whose firm manages $2.8 billion. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a lot of facts yet. A lot of what is out there about the impact on Intel is supposition.\u201d \nGovernment agencies and security experts said they knew of no cyber attacks that had exploited the vulnerabilities, but some warned that hackers would likely work to target systems while they remained unpatched. \nThe German government\u2019s Federal Office for Information Security urged computer users to install patches as soon as they become available and asked technology companies to secure their applications as quickly as possible. \nLawyers filed a lawsuit in San Jose, California, federal court on Wednesday that sought class action status for people who had bought vulnerable Intel chips or computers that came with them already installed. \nThe lawsuit said the patches could \u201cdramatically\u201d degrade system performance, giving customers the \u201cunappealing choice\u201d of deciding whether to replace the processor, buy a new computer with one that is not vulnerable, install updates that degrade performance or do nothing and risk getting hacked. \nWhile more lawsuits are expected, Intel\u2019s biggest customers are likely to quietly seek compensation for any harm caused by the vulnerabilities, including costs to patch machines or replace microprocessors, Johnson said. \nIntel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday about the lawsuit alleging degraded performance. \nLegal experts said that consumers would have to prove concrete damages and harm to proceed with claims. \nClass action lawsuits over cybersecurity issues at companies including Anthem Inc, Target Corp and Yahoo have yielded mixed results and U.S. federal appeals courts are divided over what evidence is needed to bring such claims. \nStewart Baker, a Washington-based lawyer focusing on technology law, said updates that decrease a chip\u2019s performance might warrant monetary damages. \n\u201cBut a lot of these cases are settled for three cents on the dollar,\u201d Baker said, adding that consumers would likely see very little compensation. \nIntel shares fell 1.8 percent on Thursday, following a 3.4 percent decline Wednesday. \nShares in rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc climbed 4.9 percent as investors speculated the No. 2 maker of microprocessors would woo customers away from Intel. \nStill, researchers had said some of AMD\u2019s chips had one of the two vulnerabilities disclosed on Wednesday, as do processors from ARM Holdings.

{"published":"2018-01-02T23:46:00.000+02:00","title":"Iran protests could hurt clerics but Rouhani has most to lose, say insiders","text":"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian authorities are concerned that nationwide unrest will undermine the clerical establishment and want to stamp out the protests quickly, senior government officials say. But the person with the most to lose is President Hassan Rouhani.\nWhile several senior officials said there was concern that prolonged unrest would damage the legitimacy and influence of the country\u2019s religious leaders, few insiders see the unrest as an existential threat to that leadership, which has ruled since the 1979 revolution and is now controlled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the ultimate authority in Iran\u2019s system of dual clerical and republican rule.\nThe biggest loser, they say, is likely to be Rouhani, who is much more closely tied to the country\u2019s economic policies.\n\u201cOf course Rouhani and his government will have less power afterwards, especially because his economic policy was criticized during the unrest,\u201d said political analyst Hamid Farahvashian.\n\u201cHe will be a lame-duck president and Khamenei will have more power.\u201d\nMuch of the protesters\u2019 anger has focused on what Rouhani and his government have failed to deliver: an economic boom promised as the payoff for the 2015 deal that curbed Iran\u2019s disputed nuclear program in return for world powers lifting sanctions.\nProtesters are angry that Iran\u2019s youth unemployment rate is edging towards 30 percent, want higher wages and an end to alleged graft. They have chanted slogans against all of Iran\u2019s leaders, including the clerical elite, and attacked police vehicles, banks and mosques as the unrest widened.\n\u201cThe continuation of the protests will lead to a legitimacy crisis,\u201d said one senior official close to Rouhani, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.\n\u201cPeople have economic demands ... of course these demands should be taken seriously ... of course the establishment should listen to the people, but all these can be discussed in a calm atmosphere,\u201d the official said.\nSome conservatives have pushed for a hardline approach, even though bloodshed could fuel more protests in the largest wave of demonstrations since nationwide unrest in 2009.\n\u201cSo far, security forces have not tried to prevent the demonstrations .... but this will change if (Khamenei) calls for an end to the street protests and demonstrators defy his call,\u201d said one former Iranian official from the reformist camp.\nEven if the unrest is quelled, the demands of tens of thousands of restless working class youths who have taken to the streets are unlikely to dissipate.\nKhamenei spoke publicly for the first time about the crisis on Tuesday, accusing Iran\u2019s enemies of stirring unrest but saying no more. A statement on his website said he would address the nation about the events \u201cwhen the time is right\u201d.\nTHE LIMITS OF ROUHANI\u2018S POWER\nOpponents of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani hold a protest outside the Iranian embassy in Rome, Italy, January 2, 2018. REUTERS\/Tony Gentile The protesters have little chance of toppling the clerical leaders, who appear to be retaining control of the military, police, and security forces and have no compunction about using them, according to one U.S. official following the developments.\nRouhani, who was elected in 2013, is more exposed. He is seen as a pragmatist at odds with Iran\u2019s hardliners and has said in response to the protests that Iranians have a right to criticize the authorities.\nBut he has a fight on his hands because of growing resentment over high prices and allegations of corruption.\n\u201cHis power is limited in Iran\u2019s ruling system. Public discontent is increasing ... people are losing their faith in the establishment system,\u201d a third Iranian official said. \u201cThe leaders are well aware of this fact and its dangerous consequences.\u201d\nU.S. officials fear the likeliest outcome of the protests is discrediting what one called Rouhani\u2019s \u201cmoderate brand of moderation\u201d and a harsher crackdown by the clerical authorities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an open question whether Rouhani ever intended to keep any of his promises, but he hasn\u2019t delivered, especially on the economic front, and that means he has no popular support and is expendable to Khamenei,\u201d said a second U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\u201cHe\u2019s likely to be one of the casualties, though maybe not immediately.\u201d\nRouhani has blamed his predecessor and the United States, Iran\u2019s long-time adversary, for the economy\u2019s shortcomings.\nBut his government has also backtracked on planned fuel price rises and promised more jobs.\nRouhani may need to spend more money to create more employment if he is to ease discontent, and could risk antagonizing powerful interests if he tries to address allegations of corruption.\nHis vulnerability and the deep divisions in Iran\u2019s hierarchy have fueled suspicions among some of his sympathizers that conservative rivals may have played a hand in the crisis.\n\u201cIt was a coup against Rouhani and his achievements ... The aim was to harm Rouhani,\u201d said Saeed Leylaz, a political analyst close to the pro-reform movement.\nBut a fourth official in Tehran said the nationwide protests had united Iran\u2019s leadership.\n\u201cAt this point it is not important whether a political faction initiated the unrest to harm the rival group,\u201d the official said.\n\u201cThe unrest was hijacked by our enemies ... that is why all factions have united to protect the Islamic Republic.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by John Walcott in Washington and Andrew Torchia in Dubai; Writing by Michael Georgy; Editing by Nick Tattersall\n "}

The trades are already permitted in other markets ranging from Black Sea wheat to Eurodollars. \nBlock trades are large, privately negotiated deals that are struck away from the broader market by phone or otherwise and cleared by the exchange. They must exceed exchange-set size limits and be reported publicly after completion. \nThe transactions help traders execute large-lot orders at a \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d single price and avoid disrupting prices in markets with lower liquidity, such as deferred-contract months, according to CME Group. \nThe company has lost liquidity in deferred futures spreads as the rise of computerized algorithmic trading has driven more activity to front-month contracts, said Gary Sandlund, president of brokerage Futures International. \n\u201cThe exchange is doing a very good thing here in attempting to try to bring that back into the exchange and create a bit more transparency on some of these back-end spreads,\u201d he said. \nThe expansion of block trading is the latest evolution of the agricultural markets, which trace their origins to grain merchants who formed the CBOT in 1848. The closure of open-outcry futures pits, in which traders shouted out orders to buy and sell contracts, marked the end of an era in 2015, after most transactions went online. \nCME Group held calls with agricultural traders to gauge support for block trades, according to a letter it sent to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The transactions should account for a small percentage of overall trading and not reduce liquidity, the letter said. \n\u201cAn overwhelming majority of market participants are in favor,\u201d CME Group said. \nHowever, the National Grain and Feed Association told CME Group and the CFTC in letters that the change threatens transparency by removing business from the public marketplace. The association represents more than 1,000 companies that handle over 70 percent of U.S. grain and oilseed harvests. \n\u201cIt is our opinion that when large trades in deferred months are negotiated between parties \u2018off exchange\u2019 that price discovery is very likely compromised,\u201d the association told CME Group.

Most holders are wealthy Chinese individuals. \nThe Journal said the company also received a separate request from New York federal prosecutors in the same month for information on development projects financed in part by the EB-5 program. \nKushner, Kushner Cos, the White House and New York prosecutors did not reply to requests for comment from Reuters. The SEC could not be reached for comment. \nKushner Cos referred the Journal to a previous statement on its use of the EB-5 program: \u201cKushner Cos utilized the program, fully complied with its rules and regulations, and did nothing improper. We are cooperating with legal requests for information.\u201d \nThe exact subject of the SEC\u2019s inquiry, or whether it identified particular projects, is not clear, the Journal reported. \nThe Kushners use of EB-5 visas to raise cash to finance developments came to broad attention in May last year, when Kushner\u2019s sister, Nicole Kushner, spoke at a publicly advertised event in Shanghai to attract Chinese investment into a two-tower luxury apartment complex in New Jersey, called One Journal Square, being developed jointly by Kushner Cos and KABR Group. The company later apologized for mentioning Jared Kushner\u2019s name while wooing investors. \nThe developers were seeking to raise $150 million, or 15.4 percent of funding for the project, from investors through the EB-5 visa program, according to marketing materials posted by the event\u2019s organizer, immigration agency Qiaowai, Reuters reported at the time. \nKushner Cos is not a publicly traded company but the EB-5 is considered a securities offering, the Journal said, hence the SEC\u2019s interest. \nKushner resigned from his role leading Kushner Cos when he was appointed Trump\u2019s senior White House adviser early last year but still owns a stake in parts of the business, according to his most recent personal financial disclosure form, the Journal said.

That decision was extended last autumn after a large survey of public opinion, in which 60,000 people took part, found 99 percent opposed fracking.\nHowever expert opinion consulted as part of the government\u2019s report also found that the regulatory framework was \u201clargely in place\u201d to control the potential environmental impacts.\nIneos said that, having attracted investment for fracking, the ban would mean the Scottish government had to compensate the companies concerned.\n\u201cIf Scotland wants to continue to be considered as a serious place to do business, then it cannot simply remove the policy support that attracted that investment in the first place without proper procedures being followed and without the offer of appropriate financial compensation,\u201d Pickering said.\nScottish government energy minister Paul Wheelhouse, said:\n\u201cWe have taken a careful and considered approach to arriving at our preferred policy on unconventional oil and gas in Scotland.\u201d\nEditing by Stephen Addison\n "}

Reuters reported in December that Didi planned to enter Mexico this year. \nIt has previously partnered with overseas ride-hailing companies to offer reciprocal services in other countries, but Didi is now looking to launch its own services overseas. \nDidi's Mexico entry represents the 4-year-old firm's first move to deploy drivers under its own brand outside of China. \nCheng Wei, founder and chief executive of Didi, said in Wednesday's statement that \"globalization is a top strategic priority for Didi.\" \nDidi first invested $100 million in 99 in January 2017, getting a stake and management rights in the Brazilian app. \nOne source with knowledge of the matter said the funds selling their stakes in 99 started looking for a buyer several months ago, in mid-2017. \nRiverwood, Monashees, Tiger Global, and SoftBank did not reply to requests for comment. \nDidi has made no secret of its desire to expand beyond China, particularly in light of the growing number of Chinese customers who travel overseas. \nThe firm sealed its dominance in the Chinese market after buying out Uber's local China business in 2016, ending an expensive subsidy war that cost the U.S. firm roughly $2 billion. \nIn December, Didi raised $4 billion from investors, in part to fund global expansion, following on from a $5.5 billion fundraising in April.

The amount of the quarterly interest payment is $1.875 per $1,000 original principal amount of Debentures. As of December 30, 2017, 1,116 Debentures remained outstanding in the aggregate adjusted principal amount of $422,542, after giving effect to today\u2019s quarterly interest payment.\nUnder the Indenture for the Debentures, the original principal amount of the Debentures is reduced in an amount equal to each extraordinary distribution that is made to holders of the Debentures. Thereafter, the adjusted principal amount is further reduced on each successive quarterly interest payment date to the extent necessary to cause the quarterly interest payment to represent the payment of an annualized yield of 0.75% of the adjusted principal amount. This latter adjustment, to the extent it is made by reason of a particular extraordinary distribution that results in a reduction to the principal amount of the Debentures, takes effect on the second succeeding interest payment date after the payment of that extraordinary distribution.\nTo date, Liberty has made one extraordinary distribution to holders of the Debentures. On June 16, 2016, Liberty made an extraordinary distribution of $614.4332 per $1,000 original principal amount of the Debentures attributable to the cash distribution made to former holders of common stock of Time Warner Cable, Inc. (\u201cTWC\u201d) on May 18, 2016, in connection with the mergers involving Charter Communications, Inc. and TWC (the \u201cCharter\/TWC Merger\u201d). The extraordinary distribution was based on the \u201caverage transaction consideration\u201d paid in the Charter\/TWC Merger, as that term is defined in the Indenture for the Debentures.\nReductions to the principal amount of the Debentures do not affect the amount of the quarterly interest payments received by holders of the Debentures, which will continue to be a rate equal to 0.75% per annum of the original principal amount of the Debentures. Below is a detail of the amount of the quarterly interest payment being made on the Debentures, its allocation between payment of interest and repayment of principal and the revised adjusted principal amount of the Debentures resulting from such payment, per $1,000 original principal amount of the Debentures:\nDecember 30, 2017\nBeginning Adjusted\nPrincipal\nPayment Interest Payment of\nPrincipal\nDecember 30, 2017\nEnding Adjusted\nPrincipal\n$379.7849 $1.875 $0.7121 $1.1629 $378.6220 Liberty also announced the payment today, to holders of the Debentures as of December 15, 2017, of an additional distribution of $2.1041 per Debenture, which is attributable to the regular quarterly dividends paid by Time Warner Inc. of $0.4025 on November 1, 2017 and by Time Inc. of $0.0400 on December 15, 2017.

And you can't give it the same menu every day,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \"This tape not only manages to feed the beast every day, it gives the monster that is this market exactly the kind of well-balanced diet it needs to keep roaring.\"\nAfter a healthy rally in industrial stocks involved in everything from machinery to aerospace to oil to shipping, Cramer said the beast would need a break from devouring these names.\nAfter all, a rally driven only by a select group of stocks tends to trade narrowly and be expensive, two factors that scream bad breadth \u2014 in other words, poor variety \u2014 to money managers.\nSo as the market's menu of stocks shifted on Thursday, Cramer took to the tape to pinpoint the morsels that came back into favor on Wall Street.\nDominion Energy CEO bullish on latest deal F. Carter Smith | Bloomberg | Getty Images Thomas Farrell, chief executive officer of Dominion Resources Dominion Energy CEO Tom Farrell told CNBC on Thursday that Dominion's acquisition of South Carolinian utility Scana would set his company up for significant long-term gains.\n\"We're investing for the long-term in South Carolina,\" Farrell told Cramer. \" Scana's a very good company. It's got very good growth in its electric and gas utilities. South Carolina's a wonderful state to do business in. We're already there with a pipeline business and some solar farms. Great prospects ahead.\"\nOn Wednesday, Dominion announced it would buy Scana in an all-stock deal worth nearly $15 billion. The merger will help Scana stem customer and shareholder outrage after a $9 billion nuclear project gone wrong, which resulted in Scana's former CEO stepping down .\nFarrell said that Dominion would absorb nearly $1.7 billion in costs from the uncompleted plant that were not yet reflected in customers' utility rates.\nCramer's 'trade war' playbook China Daily | Reuters An employee works at a steel factory in Dalian, Liaoning Province, China, July 4, 2016.

It was down 0.8 percent on the week, its first week of losses in seven, after a stellar start to the year riding the wave of rising global equities. \nConsumer staples companies whose profits are seen as less volatile to swings in consumer demand such as Unilever and cigarette maker BAT helped pull the index to a higher close. \nA report showed British shop sales slid by much more than expected in December. That capped the weakest year for retail since 2013 as consumers squeezed by high inflation continued to keep a tight grip on spending. \n\"This certainly ties in to much of what we have seen this year,\" said Colin McLean, managing director at SVM Asset Management. \"In the past, demand has been quite stable and now it's just a bit more fluid.\" \nConsumers' changing tastes and disruption by online businesses were putting pressure on the high street retailers, McLean said. \nBritain's biggest flooring retailer, Carpetright sank to a record low, slumping 39 percent after warning that profits would miss expectations. Sales in the core flooring category fell 7.1 percent in the post-Christmas period . \nCrematorium operator Dignity sank 50 percent after warning on 2018 profit.

Application volume was 6.1 percent higher than one year ago. 43 Mins Ago | 00:39 \nSpring has sprung early in this housing market. Buyers, seeing a new trend toward higher interest rates, are rushing in before the first buds appear. \nMortgage applications rose 4.5 percent last week from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted report. Application volume was 6.1 percent higher than the same week one year ago. \nApplications to purchase a home led the charge, rising 6 percent for the week to the highest level since April 2010. These loan applications are now 7 percent higher than the same week one year ago. \n\"A combination of being left on the sideline last summer due to a lack of inventory for sale and the prospect of slowly rising interest rates over the near term appears to have buyers in a hurry to start the spring buying season,\" said Lynn Fisher, MBA's vice president of research and economics. \nThe average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances of $453,100 or less increased to 4.36 percent, its highest level since March. That's up from 4.33 percent, with points remaining unchanged at 0.54, including the origination fee, for 80 percent loan-to-value ratio loans. The 15-year fixed rate climbed to its highest level since September 2013. \nMortgage applications to refinance a home loan also rose, up 1 percent for the week, despite higher rates. Refinance volume usually moves in the opposite direction of interest rates, but borrowers are clearly worried that the direction now is only going to be higher, and they may miss an opportunity with rates still near multiyear lows. Mortgage rates loosely follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury. \n\"Last week, 10-year Treasury yields increased by 10 basis points over the course of holiday-shortened week, due to a mixed bag of economic and political headlines,\" Fisher said, referring to Martin Luther King Day. \nNot only are homebuyers facing higher mortgage rates, they are looking at a spring season with precious few homes for sale, especially in the starter and mid-level categories. Inventory has been falling for more than two years and homebuilders are not even close to meeting today's strong demand. That means higher home prices even amid higher mortgage rates. \n\"The increases that we've seen so far have only gotten people off the couch and into the market,\" Glenn Kelman, CEO of Redfin, told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Tuesday. \"People are worrying that they need to hurry and buy a house now before rates go up further.\" Diana Olick CNBC Real Estate Reporter Playing"}

(\u201cStandard Lithium\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSXV:SLL) (OTCQX:STLHF) (FRANKFURT:S5L) is pleased to announce that the Company has signed an Option Agreement with TETRA Technologies Inc. (TETRA), a non-affiliated NYSE-listed company, to acquire the rights to conduct exploration, production and lithium extraction activities on up to 33,000 acres of brine leases located in an area where the Smackover Formation is known to be highly productive in southern Arkansas, USA.\nStandard Lithium\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert Mintak commented, \u201c In our search for opportunities of significance, this is one that could really move the needle. We believe the Smackover may be one of the lithium industry\u2019s most promising regions to develop, given the potential resource size and large-scale brine-handling infrastructure in the region. This agreement highlights our excellent working relationship with TETRA, and signing this deal allows Standard Lithium access to the last available large lease package in the key brine production zone of the Smackover. \u201d\nProject Highlights:\nUp to 33,000 acres of brine leases in key brine production fairway in southern Arkansas, adjacent to producing Albemarle leases; Historical data from Standard Lithium lease area shows 370-424 mg\/L lithium in brines (Moldovanyi and Walter, 1992); Arkansas currently produces the equivalent of 42.6 million m 3 (9,380,000,000 gallons) of brine per year (based on Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission reported average brine production from 2010-2016), almost entirely from the Smackover Formation; Low risk, well understood geology and chemistry; Significant infrastructure, roads, power, water, trained workforce in region; and Existing brine extraction, processing and re-injection permitting regime.\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Andy Robinson also commented, \u201c the Company chose the Smackover Formation as a key development target, precisely because it combines a very large resource potential, with well-studied and documented geology and hydrogeology, along with a permitting regime that has a long history of approving operations that remove, process and re-inject massive volumes of brine. Combined with a wealth of existing infrastructure in the project area (power, rail, gas, water, trained workforce, cheap reagents etc.), this makes Standard\u2019s new opportunity in Southern Arkansas the perfect location to locate a modern lithium brine processing operation. Due to the wealth of already-available data from our new project area, we can start the process of compiling a maiden resource estimate for this large lease package extremely quickly, with a minimum of additional intrusive investigation. \u201d\nTransaction Terms\nUnder the terms of the Option Agreement with TETRA, the Company will be granted the rights in consideration for a series of cash payments, as well as certain ongoing royalties tied to lithium production from the properties. In consideration of the execution of the Option Agreement, the Company has made a non-refundable cash payment to TETRA of US$500,000, with further cash payments owing to TETRA as follows:\nUS$500,000 on or before the date that is thirty (30) calendar days following the Agreement Date; an additional US$600,000 on or before the date which is twelve (12) months following the Agreement Date; an additional US$700,000 on or before the date which is twenty-four (24) months following the Agreement Date; an additional US$750,000 on or before the date which is thirty-six (36) months following the Agreement Date; and an additional annual payment of US$1,000,000 on or before each annual anniversary of the Agreement Date, beginning with the date that is forty-eight (48) months following the Agreement Date, until the earlier of the expiration of the 10 year exploratory period or, if the Company exercises the Option, the Company begins payment of the Royalty.\nUpon commercial production, the Company will pay TETRA a two and one-half percent (2.5%) royalty on gross revenue derived from the sale of lithium produced from the properties, subject to a minimum annual royalty payment of US$1,000,000.\nQuality Assurance\nRaymond Spanjers, Certified Professional Geologist (SME No. 3041730), is a qualified person as defined by NI 43-101, and has supervised the preparation of the scientific and technical information that forms the basis for this news release.

The Company is currently focused on the immediate exploration and development of the Bristol Dry Lake Lithium Project located in the Mojave region of San Bernardino County, California; the location has significant infrastructure in-place, with easy road and rail access, abundant electricity and water sources, and is already permitted for extensive brine extraction and processing activities.

FILE PHOTO - Pedestrians walk past a Poundland store in London, Britain November 10, 2015. REUTERS\/Stefan Wermuth\/Files \nThe owner of more than 40 multinational retail brands including Conforama, Mattress Firm and Poundland, revealed the \u201caccounting irregularity\u201d last month along with the immediate departure of its chief executive. Its chairman briefly took the reins then also stepped down. \n\u201cWhile the Group has achieved some degree of stabilisation in its operating businesses, significant near-term liquidity is still required in certain of the business units,\u201d Steinhoff said on Thursday. \nChief financial officer Ben la Grange, whom the company has cleared of any wrongdoing, will leave his position and Philip Dieperink, the finance chief of Steinhoff\u2019s UK business, will become acting CFO. \nThe company said la Grange would concentrate on \u201cthe preservation and procurement of liquidity in the group\u201d and finalising its 2017 accounts. \nTurnaround specialist AlixPartners was called in last month to help shore up finances as lenders have started restricting access to credit lines and insurers are cancelling or reducing credit insurance. \nSteinhoff, which has debts of around 10.7 billion euros, said it planned to hire a debt restructuring expert in the role of chief restructuring officer. \nEarlier this week, Steinhoff said it would have to restate its 2015 accounts and maybe even earlier figures, having already warned on its 2016 numbers. SHARES REBOUND \nMore than $10 billion has been wiped off Steinhoff\u2019s market value following the disclosure of the scandal that has claimed the heads of CEO Markus Jooste and chairman Christo Wiese. They were key figures who transformed Steinhoff from a modest furniture distributor to a global household goods giant. \nShares in Steinhoff, still down about 80 percent from a month ago, rebounded more than 25 percent on Thursday to 8.60 rand. \nThis week UK subsidiary Poundland reported strong Christmas trading and European unit, Pepkor Europe, which houses Poundland and Dealz, said it had replaced planned investment from its parent in full with a new independent 180 million pound loan. \nMeanwhile, the company\u2019s Asia Pacific subsidiary has hired lawyers and a restructuring specialist to advise on the \u201csignificant uncertainty\u201d facing its parent. \nSteinhoff has so far raised around $400 million from the sale of a portion of its stake in South African investment heavyweight PSG Group ( PSGJ.J ). It is also due to receive around $1.2 billion in debt repayment from its subsidiary, Steinhoff Africa Retail. \nThe company, which moved its primary share listing from Johannesburg to Frankfurt two years ago, has been under investigation for suspected accounting fraud in Germany since 2015. Four current and former managers are under suspicion of having overstated revenues at subsidiaries, prosecutors have said. \nSteinhoff has previously said that the investigation relates to whether revenues were booked properly and whether taxable profits were correctly declared. \n($1 = 0.8284 euros)"}

Family members have said the two told them they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some documents by the officers they had gone to meet.\nThe two had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where - according to U.N. estimates - about 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants.\nMyanmar\u2019s Ministry of Information has said the reporters \u201cillegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media\u201d.\nGovernment spokesman Zaw Htay declined to comment on the charges but said the two had their rights under an independent judicial system.\n\u201cThe judge will be decide whether they are guilty or not according to the law,\u201d he told Reuters.\nReuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J.

The cold will extend down to the mid-Atlantic states, he said.\n\"It can be very dangerous,\" Pydynowski said. \"Any kind of exposed skin can freeze in a couple of minutes.\"\nThe cold also raised the risk that road salt would not work to melt ice, possibly leaving highway crews to shift over to sanding roads to improve traction, Massachusetts transportation officials said.\nUtility companies across the East worked to repair downed power lines early on Friday as about 31,000 customers remained without electricity, down from almost 80,000 the day before, and issued warnings that temperatures may become dangerously low.\n\"If the temperature in your home begins to fall, we recommend taking shelter elsewhere until service can be restored,\" National Grid power company, which serves Massachusetts, said on Twitter . \"You can find warming centers by contacting local authorities.\"\n17 deaths The storm, with winds gusts of more than 70 miles per hour, dumped a foot or more of snow throughout the region , including Boston and parts New Jersey and Maine, where heavy snow continued to fall early on Friday.\nThe wintry weather has been blamed for at least 17 deaths in the past few days, including three in North Carolina traffic accidents and three in Texas because of the cold.\nSchools in Boston and Baltimore canceled classes Friday while New York was open and Newark, New Jersey, schools were to open two hours late.\nCommuter railways serving New York and Boston's suburbs were reporting extensive delays, as they worked to repair frozen equipment and clear snow-covered tracks.\nThe storm on Thursday caused a 3-foot tidal surge that flooded the area around Boston's historic Long Wharf with icy seawater. Firefighters used an inflatable raft to rescue one motorist from a car submerged in water up to its door handles, Boston Fire Commissioner Joseph Finn told reporters.\nCommunities outside Boston, including Scituate, also saw extensive flooding, with parking lots filled with water damaging unoccupied vehicles.\nNew York's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports resumed flights on Friday after closing in whiteout conditions a day earlier. More than 1,000 U.S. flights had been canceled early on Friday with New York's three major airports and Boston Logan International Airport seeing the most cancellations.\nThe storm was powered by a rapid plunge in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters called a bombogenesis, or a \"bomb cyclone.\" It brought high winds and swift, heavy snowfall.\nNearly 500 members of the National Guard were activated along the East Coast to assist with emergency response, including 200 in New York state, the U.S. Department of Defense said in a statement.\nOfficials reported traffic accidents throughout the Northeast and the storm's reach extended to eastern Canada."}

The tanker hit a freight ship on Saturday night in the East China Sea and burst into flames after spilling oil.

Morgan and Wells Fargo kick off big bank earnings this week, potentially fueling more gains for the stock market or putting a wrench in this record-making stretch. \nBut forget the short-term noise, the Vertical Group analyst said Tuesday, the bank rally could be explosive this year. \n\"Who cares what happens in the fourth quarter? It's ancient history,\" Bove said Tuesday on CNBC's \" Trading Nation .\" \"What we care about is if we get this investment banking thing going, if we get these loans happening, banks will make a lot of money in 2018.\" \nThe key to industry activity this year will be investment banking, which Bove predicts will see a sharp pickup. The reason is twofold: well-known unicorns such as car-hailing service Uber could float their shares and public companies could bring more stock to market, both stemming from current enthusiasm for equities. \nOn top of the predicted recovery in investment activity, banks currently have a lot of liquidity to work with. That will only support earnings should the U.S. economy improve as expected. \n\"These banks are sitting with a massive amount of underutilized earning capacity,\" said Bove, calculating $3.7 trillion in the banking sector that is currently available. \"If the economy were to rise with any degree ... that liquidity would be put to work and bank earnings would go up very sharply in 2018.\" \nGoldman Sachs could be the best of the bunch, said Bove, as it is perfectly poised to benefit from a revival in investment banking and trading. Vertical Group rated Goldman as a sell for most of 2017, but switched it to a buy on the firm's sunny outlook for investment and trading activity. \nGoldman's stock was the worst performer of the major banking and investment companies in 2017, clocking a 6.4 percent gain for the year. That was slightly less than the 10 percent rise by shares of Wells Fargo but a fraction of the gains of more than 20 percent seen by Citigroup , JPMorgan, Bank of America , and Morgan Stanley . \nBefore a possible 2018 earnings surge, fourth-quarter results will be dissected and the major banks are likely to see the same problems that hounded the industry over the first three quarters of 2017. Bove noted weak trading, soft loan volume and little benefit from the Federal Reserve 's rate increases as possible pressures on earnings in the recent quarter. \n\"The net of it is most of the earnings improvements [that] will occur will be in keeping costs down, keeping loan losses down and therefore, you'll get a slight improvement in earnings but nothing exciting,\" he said. \nBanks are set to report for the fourth quarter at the end of this week and the next. BlackRock, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo are scheduled for Friday. Next week, Citigroup is slated for Tuesday, Bank of America and Goldman on Wednesday, and Morgan Stanley on Thursday. "}

It did not provide any details and said the full 48-page report could not be released due to pending investigations. \nIn a separate statement on Thursday, the ministry said its recommendation to regional authorities in charge of managing EU subsidies followed a letter from the European Commission which recommended taking back requests to fund a number of projects under criminal investigation or investigation by OLAF. \n\u201cThe European Commission...proposed to take out expenditure that is subject to administrative or criminal proceedings or proceedings by OLAF from European funding,\u201d the ministry said. \n\u201cThe ministry therefore today turned to (regional administrators) and the Environment Ministry with a proposal to accept the European Commission letter.\u201d \nBabis and his spokespersons were not immediately available for comment. \nStork Nest, a conference center and a farm outside Prague, had undisclosed owners when it requested the subsidy. The funding, made under the EU\u2019s program for poorer EU regions, was meant for small business and Babis\u2019s Agrofert would not qualify. It was however owned by Agrofert entities earlier and is now owned by Agrofert again. \nBabis has been charged with subsidy fraud in the case but won parliamentary immunity in the election. The lower house is expected to vote on lifting his immunity in the coming weeks. \nIt is up to regional Czech authorities to decide on the European Commission and the Finance Ministry recommendation.

That is equivalent to just under 1 million barrels, worth about $60 million, based on global crude oil prices. \n\u201cSanchi is floating and burning as of now,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cThere is an oil slick and we are pushing forward with rescue efforts.\u201d \nState media CCTV showed pictures of the tanker ablaze and billowing plumes of thick dark smoke. \nIt had sent four rescue ships and three cleaning boats to the site by 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) on Sunday, it added. \nSouth Korea also sent a ship and helicopter to help. A Korean Coast Guard official confirmed the tanker was still raging at 1 p.m. (0500 GMT). He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media. \nThe tanker\u2019s 32 crew members were all Iranian nationals except for two Bangladeshi nationals, the Chinese transport ministry said. \n\u201cThere is a wide perimeter of flames around the vessel because of the spillage and search and rescue efforts are being carried out with difficulty,\u201d Rastad said. \n\u201cUnfortunately, up to this moment, there is no news of the crew,\u201d he said. \nCF Crystal\u2019s 21 crew members, all Chinese nationals, were rescued and the ship suffered \u201cnon-critical\u201d damage, China\u2019s transport ministry said. \nIt was not immediately clear how much environmental damage had been caused or the volume of oil spiled into the sea. \nThe last major oil tanker disaster was the sinking of the Prestige off Spain in November 2002, which caused one of Europe\u2019s worst environmental catastrophes. \nAbout 63,000 tonnes of fuel oil leaked into the Atlantic, damaging beaches in France, Spain and Portugal and forcing the closure of Spain\u2019s richest fishing grounds. MAJOR MARITIME INCIDENT \nThe incident also marked the first major maritime incident involving an Iranian tanker since the lifting of international sanctions on Iran in January 2016. \nThere was a collision involving an NITC-operated supertanker in the Singapore Strait in August 2016, but there was no loss of life or pollution. \nThe Chinese government gave no details of the size of the spill. The Foreign Ministry said in a separate statement that the cause of the incident was under investigation. \nReuters ship tracking data shows Sanchi was built in 2008 and was managed by the National Iranian Tanker Co (NITC). Its registered owner is Bright Shipping Ltd. \nIt was due to arrive at Daesan in South Korea from Kharg Island in Iran on Sunday, according to Reuters ship tracking. \nThe Sanchi tanker, leased by Hanwha Total Petrochemical Co Ltd [SMCHE.UL], had \u201cvalid foreign insurance\u201d, Iranian oil ministry spokesman Kasra Nouri told Iran\u2019s state television. \nHanwha Total was not immediately available for comment. \nSanchi collided with CF Crystal, registered in Hong Kong, which was carrying 64,000 tonnes of grain from the United States to China\u2019s southern province of Guangdong, the government said. \nCF Crystal, which was built in 2011, was due to arrive in China on Jan. 10, according to Reuters ship tracking data.

The outbreaks are usually triggered by extra nutrients in the water but the reason for the current outbreak was unclear, Sweatman said.\nThe reef is still recovering from damage wrought by the worst-ever coral bleaching on record, which in 2016 killed two-thirds of a 700km stretch of reef.\nOn Friday a report published in the journal Science found that high ocean temperatures are harming tropical corals much more often than a generation ago, putting reefs under pressure.\nThe Great Barrier Reef, covering 348,000 square kilometers, was world heritage listed in 1981 as the most extensive and spectacular coral reef ecosystem on the planet, according to the UNESCO website.\nReporting by Tom Westbrook, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n "}

This represents the 356th consecutive monthly dividend since the Trust\u2019s inception in May 1988.\nThe following are annualized distribution rate calculations based on the declared dividend for the month, Net Asset Value (\u201cNAV\u201d) at month-end and the month-end NYSE composite closing price (\u201cMarket\u201d).\nAnnualized Period-end Distribution Rates\nDIVIDEND NAV MARKET December 31, 2017 $ .0220 4.60% 5.11% November 30, 2017 $ .0215 4.62% 5.15% October 31, 2017 $ .0220 4.57% 5.05% September 30, 2017 $ .0225 4.84% 5.23% August 31, 2017 $ .0240 4.98% 5.45% July 31, 2017 $ .0250 5.15% 5.51% June 30, 2017 $ .0250 5.34% 5.65% May 31, 2017 $ .0260 5.33% 5.66% April 30, 2017 $ .0260 5.50% 5.78% March 31, 2017 $ .0270 5.51% 5.88% February 28, 2017 $ .0260 5.84% 6.06% January 31, 2017 $ .0270 5.49% 5.70% December 31, 2016 $ .0270 5.50% 5.74% Voya Prime Rate Trust was the first Fund to invest in a portfolio of floating rate senior bank loans. The Trust seeks to provide as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital.\nThe Trust is managed by Voya Investments, LLC and sub-advised by Voya Investment Management Co. LLC, and its shares are distributed by Voya Investments Distributor, LLC. The adviser, the sub-adviser and the distributor are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Voya Financial, Inc. (NYSE: VOYA). The Trust\u2019s operations are based in Scottsdale, Arizona.\nDistribution Rates are calculated by annualizing dividends declared during the period (i.e., divide the monthly dividend amount by the number of days in the related month and multiply by the number of days in the fiscal year) and then dividing the resulting annualized dividend by the month-ending NAV (in the case of NAV) or the month-end closing price on the NYSE composite (in the case of Market). The distribution rate is based solely on actual dividends and distributions, which are made at the discretion of management. The distribution rate may or may not include all investment income, and ordinarily will not include capital gains.\nPast performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment in the Trust will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.\nPrincipal Risk Factor(s) : The Trust invests primarily in below investment grade, floating rate senior loans that carry a higher than normal risk that borrowers may default in the timely payment of principal and interest on their loans, which would likely cause the value of the Trust\u2019s Common Shares to decrease. Changes in short-term market interest rates will directly affect the yield on the Trust\u2019s Common Shares. If such rates fall, the Trust\u2019s yield will also fall. If interest rate spreads on Trust\u2019s loans decline in general, the yield on the Trust\u2019s loans will fall and the value of the Trust\u2019s loans may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on loans in the Trust\u2019s portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for floating rate senior bank loans, the Trust\u2019s ability to sell its loans in a timely fashion and\/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for loans may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new loans acquired by the Trust, and it may also increase the price of loans purchased by the Trust in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for loans may adversely affect the price of loans in the Trust\u2019s portfolio, which would cause the Trust\u2019s NAV to decrease. The Trust\u2019s use of leverage through borrowings or issuance of preferred shares can adversely affect the yield on the Trust\u2019s Common Shares. The Trust may invest up to 20% of its assets in loans to borrowers in countries outside of the U.S. and Canada. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Trust may invest up to 15% of its assets in loans that are denominated in certain foreign currencies, however, the Trust will engage in currency exchange transactions to seek to hedge, as closely as practicable, 100% of the economic impact to the Trust arising from foreign currency fluctuations. Other risks include but are not limited to: Borrowings; Preferred Shares; Diversification Risks; and Concentration Risks. Investors should consult the Trust\u2019s prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for a more detailed discussion of the Trust\u2019s risks.\nFor more complete information, or to obtain a prospectus on Voya Prime Rate Trust, please contact your investment professional or Voya Investments Distributor, LLC at (800) 992-0180 or www.investments.voya.com .

More could be apprehended, they said.\nIn recent years the \u2018Ndrangheta has overtaken the Cosa Nostra, or Sicilian mob, in drugs and arms trafficking and extortion rackets, extending its tentacles into northern Europe, the United States and Canada.\nIn Germany, police also arrested about a dozen men, as part of the same operation, on suspicion of blackmail, attempted murder, money laundering and other organised crime offences.\nPolice searched six apartments and four restaurants in Germany and confiscated cash, mobile phones, documents and storage devices, they said.\nInvestigators said the clans of the Farao and Marincola families, based in the Calabrian city of Ciro Marina, had infiltrated businesses in both countries, particularly firms involved in wine, food, garbage collection and funeral services.\nAt least three Italian mayors were arrested, including the mayor of Ciro Marina, as well as a number of city councillors.\nThe clan members forced restaurants to buy meat, fish, wine and other produce from complicit retailers or wholesalers associated with the mob.\nThe farmers\u2019 group Coldiretti estimates that at least 5,000 restaurants in Italy are in criminal hands and that the so-called \u201cagro-mafia\u201d business, including harvesting and distribution, is worth about 21.8 billion euros a year.\nThe clans also took control of some private garbage collection and recycling companies as well as funeral services, forcing people to use them instead of others.\nIn at least one case, investigators found links between the \u2018Ndrangheta and managers of a government-financed migrant shelter on the Calabrian coast.\nMost of the tens of thousands of migrants who have made the dangerous crossing of the Mediterranean from North Africa to Europe land first in Sicily but many are later moved to shelters on the mainland, including Calabria.\nArrests were also made in several regions of central and northern Italy.\nEurojust, the Netherlands-based group that helps coordinate investigations and prosecutions of cross-border crime in the European Union, said in a statement that some of the Italian food producers were used as front companies to launder illicit profits made through other criminal activities.\nThere are believed to be about 100 \u2018Ndrangheta families in Calabria, and they have become more successful than their Sicilian counterparts because their family ties are closer.\nThe \u2018Ngrangheta\u2019s more horizontal structure - which gives families more independence - has made it harder for investigators to crack than the Sicilian mob, which is based on a hierarchical structure with fewer top bosses.\nAdditional reporting by Thomas Escritt in Berlin,; Editing by Gareth Jones\n "}

Governments also want to prevent companies from artificially shifting profits across borders to keep overall tax exposure low. That practice is known as base erosion and profit shifting and typically sees businesses favoring jurisdictions offering low taxes and tax havens.\n\"These efforts [by the U.S. and China] may prompt other countries to also review the competitiveness of their own tax regimes,\" said Chiu Wu Hong, head of tax at KPMG in Singapore.\nIndeed, the two largest economies in the world are not alone in a battle of tax codes \u2014 commonly deemed a race to the bottom.\nEven before the U.S. passed its latest tax bill, countries including the United Kingdom , France , Norway and Argentina have cut, or announced plans to cut, the amount they levy on companies.\n\"Countries still want to win more investments and jobs,\" said Chester Wee, partner and international tax services leader at EY. \"Assuming all other factors being equal, a more attractive tax regime and treaty network may swing a company's investment decision from one country to the other.\"\nAre lower taxes effective? Even as more countries throw their hats into the low-tax ring, experts said such policies are merely one of many factors contributing to an economy's competitiveness.

In fact, Dan estimates their full-time housesitting saves the pair over $24,000 per year.\nSo what are they doing with all the extra savings? \"We initially decided to take all the money we saved by not paying rent and use it to pay off our student loans faster,\" says Dan. \"We both still have about $100,000 in student loans combined.\"\nshow chapters The craziest things Johnny Depp bought with his millions      5:53 PM ET Fri, 29 Sept 2017 | 01:48 Dan owes about $60,000 in undergraduate loans after attending Purdue University, and Tracy has about $40,000 from the University of Wisconsin.

While they still make minimum payments, their current focus is investing in their careers.\nBuilding their careers as digital nomads Now that Dan and Tracy aren't tied to one city, they're taking advantage of their new lifestyle and building their dream careers .\n\"After five or six months, we realized that this lifestyle could also allow us to pursue careers that were more fulfilling to us,\" says Dan. \"I ended up leaving my full-time job to focus on building my financial planning practice.\"\nDan founded New Heights Financial Planning, where he works as a financial planner with clients all over the country.

{"published":"2018-01-03T16:00:00.000+02:00","title":"US Upstream M&A Deal Value Falls Sharply in H2 2017","text":"PE-Backed Start-Ups Could be Catalyst for 2018 Rebound\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Total 2017 US upstream transaction value was $64 billion in line with 2016 value and the 2008-2015 average of $69 billion. However, after $43 billion in deals in H2 2016 and $46 billion in H1 2017, transaction value plunged to just $18 billion in H2 2017, according to oil and gas information provider 1Derrick. \u2018Mega\u2019 deals (>$1 billion) crashed from 13 in H2 2016 and 9 in H1 2017 to just 3 in the second half of the year. The impact was most notable in the Permian, where transaction value fell to $2.6 billion in the last six months of 2017. However, strengthening industry fundamentals and new analysis by 1Derrick of US Private Equity (PE) investment and private company M&A trends suggests another round of deal-making and consolidation is on the horizon.\nUS deal activity in 2017 was dominated by Permian which peaked at $17.5 billion in Q1 with ExxonMobil\u2019s $5.6 billion purchase of Bopco and Noble Energy\u2019s $3.2 billion purchase of Clayton Williams Energy. Permian deal value plummeted to $2.8 billion in Q2, but was replaced by $10 billion in Marcellus activity including EQT\u2019s $8.2 billion merger with Rice Energy. Second half 2017 activity was lower but broad based including more than $6 billion in the Rockies. Producers continued to high grade their portfolios by shedding non-core acreage and expanding contiguous positions in key plays to increase average working interests and expanded lateral drilling opportunities.\n\u201cUS M&A transaction value was driven by \u2018Permania,\u2019 an intense bidding frenzy for large asset packages in the Permian Basin,\u201d commented Mangesh Hirve, COO of 1Derrick, \u201cbefore conditions changed by mid-2017. Falling oil prices widened the gap between buyer and seller expectations. A significant decline in E&P company stock prices, made it more expensive for producers to use their equity to fund large acquisitions\u201d. He added, \u201cHowever, sub billion M&A activity level remained solid, with the number of transactions between $100 million and $1 billion increasing from 16 in Q2 to 17 in Q3 and 20 in Q4. More importantly, investment continued to pour into the sector, as more than 60 new companies received more than $11 billion in capital commitments from PE firms in 2017. Private E&Ps and PE-backed firms accounted for 28% of total acquisitions in 2017.\u201d\nDespite the mid-year dip in oil prices, companies reaffirmed their long-term confidence in industry growth by remaining committed to their 2017 capital programs. That confidence was shared by Private Equity firms, which played a major role in 2017 M&A activity. PE-backed firms were involved in 15 of the 20 largest deals, participated in nearly $15 billion each in acquisitions and in divestitures during the year. More significantly, Private Equity committed more than $11 billion to 63 new companies in 2017. The largest allocations have been made by Quantum Energy Partners ($2.5 billion to five new E&Ps), EnCap Investments ($1.8 billion to seven new E&Ps), and Apollo Global Management ($1.6 billion to four new E&Ps). Appalachia-focused HG Energy II received the highest commitment among 2017 start-ups - $1.5 billion from Quantum Energy Partners to target the Marcellus and Utica shales. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board contributed $1 billion to Encino Acquisition Partners, which is seeking assets across multiple basins. PE backed start-ups are also targeting the Mid-Continent, Eagle Ford, and Permian plays.\n\u201cThis level of PE-investment is one reason why we believe another wave of US M&A and consolidation is on the horizon,\u201d according to 1Derrick\u2019s Mangesh Hirve. \u201cVery few of these new companies have made their first acquisitions,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, EnCap and Natural Gas Partners each funded seven companies that have yet to make any significant acquisitions. The remaining capital will likely be allocated over the next two or three quarters, with the focus expanding beyond the Permian. We expect oil-weighted investment will accelerate to the rapidly growing alphabet soup of plays in the Mid-Continent, such as the STACK, SCOOP, Merge, CNOW, and SoHot; to the Niobrara, and Bakken where margins have expanded since the Dakota Access Pipeline came onstream. With gas production reaching all-time highs to meet growing domestic and export demand, deal making is likely to increase in the Marcellus\/Utica, where output has reached record growth, and the revitalized Haynesville Shale, where production increased more than 25% during 2017.\u201d\n1Derrick\u2019s research shows that non-PE funded Private E&Ps acquired $28.7 billion in assets during 2011-2014, reaching a historic high of $13.4 billion in 2014. That activity fell off dramatically to $5.3 billion during 2015-2017 as these companies, many conservatively managed, awaited confirmation of a price recovery. Some companies took advantage of Permania to monetize their assets, such as the Bass Brothers\u2019 Bopco ($5.6 billion sale to ExxonMobil) and RKI Exploration ($2.75 billion sale to WPX Energy), and we expect more to opportunistically pursue asset or corporate sales to the new wave of PE-funded privates or established E&Ps. With oil prices rebounding to $60, others are likely to resume growth as public E&Ps shed non-core assets. An example is Merit Energy, the fourth largest US private company by production, which purchased Marathon Oil\u2019s Wyoming assets for $870 million.\nThe oil price rebound has encouraged public E&Ps to extend their accelerated investment programs commenced in 2017. Early 2018 guidance suggests an average 15% boost to 2018 capital spending. The S&P E&P index has also risen 27% from mid-year lows, strengthening the ability of companies to finance larger transactions. One example is Oasis Petroleum\u2019s December 2017 acquisition of Delaware Basin acreage from Forge Energy for $946 million, 83% of which was funded through the issuance of common shares. This first significant Permian deal since March 2017, could be harbinger of accelerated 2018 M&A activity.\n1Derrick ( www.1derrick.com ) is an independent oil and gas research firm with offices in Houston, Dallas, New York, London, Singapore and Bangalore.

But the UK has traditionally been an open country, welcoming of foreign direct investment. And we\u2019ll continue to do that,\u201d Fox said. \nHe did not comment specifically on the U.S. panel decision.

REUTERS\/Thomas Peter \nChina is one of the countries with which Britain hopes to sign a free trade pact once it leaves the EU, and London and Beijing have been keen to show that Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the bloc will not affect ties. \nFox said that the issue of China\u2019s service sector openness was a \u201cbig issue\u201d for Britain, but that there were more options than a post-Brexit free trade agreement (FTA) to get Beijing to open, including specific service sector agreements and mutual recognition deals. \n\u201cThere are a whole range of tools in the box. And people tend to talk as though an FTA is the only tool we have available in terms of trade liberalization. It\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \nThe focus on a \u201cGolden Era\u201d of relations, trumpeted by China and Britain in 2015 when then-prime minister David Cameron hosted a state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, has cooled under Cameron\u2019s successor, Theresa May. \nIn 2016, May caused a diplomatic spat by unexpectedly deciding to delay approval of a partly-Chinese funded nuclear power project. She later granted it, but not before drawing criticism from Beijing. \nMay is expected to visit China later this month accompanied by a business delegation, diplomatic and business sources have told Reuters, though the trip has not been formally confirmed.

Abel currently is the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company, which he joined in 1992.\nJain, 66, was named vice chair of the insurance operations. Jain is the executive vice president of National Indemnity Company and joined the Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Group in 1986.\nThe company's Board of Directors also voted to increase the number of directors to 14 from 12.\nDaniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images Greg Abel, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Co., center, speaks with attendees before the start of the Berkshire Hathaway Inc. annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S., on Saturday, May 6, 2017. But Berkshire Hathaway also said Buffett, 87, and 94-year-old partner Charlie Munger will continue in their respective roles as chairman\/CEO and vice chairman and be in charge of significant investment decisions for the company.\nAfter the announcement, Berkshire's B share class were slightly in trading.\nBuffett also said on CNBC's \" Squawk Box \" the appointment announcement is not related to any issues from his health.\nSpeculation about who will succeed Buffett as head of the unique conglomerate has picked up in recent years given his advanced age.\nBuffett discussed his succession plan in his annual letter from 2014, saying that he and Munger had already identified who should succeed him.\n\"Our directors believe that our future CEOs should come from internal candidates whom the Berkshire board has grown to know well. Our directors also believe that an incoming CEO should be relatively young, so that he or she can have a long run in the job. Berkshire will operate best if its CEOs average well over ten years at the helm. (It's hard to teach a new dog old tricks.) And they are not likely to retire at 65 either (or have you noticed?). In both Berkshire's business acquisitions and large, tailored investment moves, it is important that our counterparties be both familiar with and feel comfortable with Berkshire's CEO. Developing confidence of that sort and cementing relationships takes time. The payoff, though, can be huge. Both the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO \u2013 a successor ready to assume the job the day after I die or step down. In certain important respects, this person will do a better job than I am doing.\"\nFor many years, it was thought that person was Jain because Buffett has often spoken about him so highly.\nDaniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images Ajit Jain, head of the Berkshire Hathaway reinsurance business. Buffett wrote in his annual letter last year: \"Ajit has created tens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders. If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap me for him, don't hesitate. Make the trade!\"\nBut lately, Abel has been discussed as the most likely successor given his younger age and success in running the utility business.\n\"The most likely successor in our view, who Warren Buffett regularly praises, is Greg Abel,\" J.P. Morgan analyst Sarah DeWitt wrote in a note about Berkshire in September. \"Ajit Jain, who runs Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance, is also believed by many to be a potential successor, although our sense is his age may preclude him.\"\n\"We think Greg Abel would be a strong allocator of capital and the earning power of the underlying businesses would remain strong after Buffett,\" DeWitt added.\nBuffett has guided the sprawling conglomerate to a 20.8 percent compounded annual gain from 1965 through 2016, double the return of the S&P 500 over that period.\nTo achieve that market-beating return, Buffett has assembled a collection of cash-generating industrial and insurance businesses through acquisitions and in turn, invested that cash to make astute large bets on public stocks.\nWhoever takes over for Buffett will likely not retain that full stock-picking role because Buffett brought in two hedge fund managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, in the last decade to do more of the investing.\nBerkshire's B share class traded lower after the announcement as investors began to think again about the future of the company without the Oracle of Omaha in charge.\n\"The stock is likely to drop, perhaps substantially over an extended period when Warren Buffett steps down, although this could ultimately present a buying opportunity because the underlying fundamentals should continue to improve and the board could repurchase significant amounts of stock if the shares fell below 1.2x book value,\" DeWitt's note said."}

(EFH), including EFH's indirect, approximately 80-percent ownership of Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC (Oncor).\nSempra Energy expects to use the net proceeds from these offerings and the related sale of shares of its common stock pursuant to the forward sale agreements referred to below, together with the net proceeds from planned future debt financings, which may include the issuance of its debt securities, commercial paper supported by its revolving credit facilities and borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, to finance the merger and related costs and expenses or, in the case of any proceeds received from settlements under the forward sale agreements that occur after the closing of the proposed merger, to repay indebtedness incurred to finance a portion of the cost of the merger and related costs and expenses. If for any reason the merger is not completed on or prior to Dec. 1, 2018, or the related merger agreement is terminated on or prior to that date, then Sempra Energy expects to use the net proceeds from the equity offerings for general corporate purposes, which may include, in Sempra Energy's sole discretion, the voluntary redemption of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, debt repayment, including repayment of commercial paper, capital expenditures, investments and possibly repurchases of its common stock at the discretion of its board of directors.\nSempra Energy intends to grant the underwriters in the respective equity offerings the option to purchase directly from Sempra Energy up to an additional $375 million of shares of its common stock and up to an additional $225 million of shares of its Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.\nMorgan Stanley, RBC Capital Markets and Barclays are acting as joint bookrunners of the equity offerings and representatives of the underwriters.\nIn connection with the common stock offering, Sempra Energy expects to enter into forward sale agreements with each of Morgan Stanley & Co.

Instead, subject to its right to elect cash settlement or net share settlement subject to certain conditions, Sempra Energy intends to deliver, upon physical settlement of such forward sale agreements on one or more dates specified by Sempra Energy occurring no later than Dec. 15, 2019, an aggregate of $2.5 billion of shares of its common stock to the forward purchasers in exchange for cash proceeds per share equal to the applicable forward sale price per share, which will initially be equal to the public offering price per share in the common stock offering, less underwriting discounts and commissions, as subsequently adjusted as provided in the forward sale agreements.\nEach share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is expected to have a liquidation preference of $100 per share.\nUnless earlier converted or redeemed, each share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert into a variable number of shares of Sempra Energy's common stock on the mandatory conversion date, which is expected to be Jan. 15, 2021.

And we\u2019ll be seeing over the next number of weeks and months what happens.\u201d\nAt a later news conference with the visiting Norwegian prime minister, Trump said the United States had problems with North Korea, but \u201ca lot of good talks are going on right now.\u201d\n\u201cI see a lot of good energy. I like it very much ... So, hopefully, a lot of good things are going to work out.\u201d\n\u201cI think that we will have peace through strength,\u201d he added, referring to his policy of ensuring peace through a strong military.\nSouth Korea\u2019s Presidential Blue House said both men had said the dialogue \u201ccould naturally lead to talks between the United States and North Korea for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula after the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.\u201d\nAt Tuesday\u2019s intra-Korea talks, North Korea said it would attend the Olympics, which South Korea will host next month, while both sides agreed to resolve problems between them through dialogue and to revive military consultations to avoid accidental conflict.\nHowever, Pyongyang said it would not discuss its nuclear weapons because they were aimed only at the United States and not its \u201cbrethren\u201d in South Korea, or Russia or China, showing that a diplomatic breakthrough to the crisis remained far off.\nWhile Washington has welcomed the talks as a first step toward solving the crisis over North Korea\u2019s program to develop nuclear missiles capable of reaching the United States, it has reiterated that any talks involving the United States must be aimed at North Korea\u2019s denuclearization.\nThe White House said Trump told Moon the United States was willing to talk to North Korea \u201cat the appropriate time and under the right circumstances.\u201d\nTrump, who has swung between hurling insults and threats at North Korea to expressing a willingness to talk, said on Saturday he would be willing to speak to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, though not without pre-conditions.\nAn unsourced article in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday said U.S. officials were debating whether it was possible to mount a limited military strike against North Korea without igniting an all-out war.\nThe Trump administration has said it prefers a diplomatic solution, but that all options are on the table, including military ones.\nU.S. officials say Trump has been considering a number of military options, including a preemptive strike on a missile or nuclear facility, but officials and analysts have warned of the risks of triggering a catastrophic wider conflict.\nA new dawn: tmsnrt.rs\/2Ar8lUu\nNorth Korea and South Korea begin talks: tmsnrt.rs\/2miGPDI\nU.S. President Donald Trump, flanked by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, holds a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, U.S., January 10, 2018.

South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with the North after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.\nWashington and Seoul opened the way for the talks last week when they announced the postponement of joint military exercises that Pyongyang has denounced as a rehearsal for invasion.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Washington had raised concerns that a New Year overture from Kim that led to the talks could be aimed at driving a wedge between the allies, but Moon said he and Washington did not differ over how to respond to North Korean threats.\n\u201cThis initial round of talks is for the improvement of relations between North and South Korea. Our task ... is to draw North Korea to talks aimed at the denuclearization of the North,\u201d he said. \u201c(It\u2018s) our basic stance that will never be given up.\u201d\nNorth Korea\u2019s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper said all problems would be resolved through the efforts of the Korean people alone.\n\u201cIf the North and South abandon external forces and cooperate together, we will be able to fully solve all problems to match our people\u2019s needs and our joint prosperity,\u201d it said.\nIn spite of the hopeful words about the potential for future talks, the U.S. intelligence assessment of North Korea\u2019s weapons programs has not altered, officials say.\nU.S. officials familiar with the classified analysis say the consensus is that Kim remains convinced that the United States is determined to overthrow him and that only a nuclear arsenal that threatens America can deter that.\nOne official said the North-South talks were likely to follow the pattern of past diplomatic efforts, in which North Korea has benefited from aid without making concessions.\nLee Woo-young, a professor at Seoul\u2019s University of North Korean Studies, said it was wise of Moon to praise Trump.\n\u201cBy doing that, he can help the U.S. build logic for moving toward negotiations,\u201d he said.\nThe United States and Canada are due to host a conference of about 20 foreign ministers next week in Vancouver to discuss North Korea, without the participation of China, Pyongyang\u2019s sole major ally and biggest trade partner.\nChina would not attend and was resolutely opposed to it, its foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said.\n\u201cIt will only create divisions within the international community and harm joint efforts to appropriately resolve the Korean peninsula nuclear issue,\u201d he said.\nAdditional reporting by Josh Smith and Hyonhee Shin in SEOUL, Michael Martina in BEIJING and David Brunnstrom, John Walcott, Tim Ahmann and Eric Beech in WASHINGTON; Writing by David Brunnstrom and Soyoung Kim; Editing by James Dalgleish\n "}

According to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales, the seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) of U.S. car and light truck sales in December fell to 17.9 million units from 18.2 million in December 2016.\nAnalysts polled by Reuters had predicted a SAAR for December of 17.5 million units.\nInvestors were pleased GM had cut its inventory of unsold vehicles - a concern for the industry earlier in 2017 - at the end of December to 63 days supply unsold vehicles, beating its target of around 70 days supply.\nBut GM said it expects the industry to sell less than 17 million new vehicles in 2018. According Autodata, 2017 full-year sales hit 17.23 million units, down nearly 2 percent from an all-time U.S. record of 17.55 million units in 2016.\nAutomakers' challenges in 2018 include dealing with an ongoing shift in consumer preference away from passenger cars to more profitable pickup trucks and SUVs, and an influx of millions of nearly-new, off-lease vehicles that are cheaper than new vehicles.\nAutomakers are still assessing the potential impacts of rising interest rates and the sweeping tax overhaul passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress last month.\nCharlie Chesbrough, chief economist at Cox Automotive, owner of the Autotrader online automobile market and Kelley Blue Book car valuation service, said the group expects 2018 sales to hit 16.7 million units and rising interest rates are one of the industry's challenges this year as they increase monthly car payments.\n\"That's real money to consumers,\" Chesbrough said on a conference call.\nFord chief economist Emily Kolinski Morris said on a conference call that interest rates are a \"headwind, but a very minor one.\" Tax cuts, however, should be a \"net positive\" for the industry, she added.\nScott Keogh, U.S. head of Audi AG, said that while tax cuts would help luxury consumers, new federal limits on local and state tax deductions could hurt sales in New York and Los Angeles, the two largest American luxury vehicle markets.\nConsumer discounts also remain a concern for the industry. Discounts of more than 10 percent of a vehicle's sticker price can hurt resale values, in turn weighing on new vehicle sales. In December, auto consultancies J.D. Power and LMC estimated discounts had topped 10 percent for the 17th time in the last 18 months.\nMark Wakefield, global co-head of automotive and industrial consulting at consultancy AlixPartners LLP - which expects U.S. industry sales to drop to 16.6 million in 2018 - said so far high discounts have not hurt automakers too much, but pricing discipline is a real concern moving forward.\n\"What we're really nervous about is if someone defects and adds $1,000 to the hood... and forces others to respond to protect market share,\" Wakefield said.\nGM reported a 3.3 percent drop in sales in December, driven by a decline in lower-margin fleet sales to government agencies and rental car companies. GM's retail sales were up 1.8 percent.\nThe automaker said its average transaction price hit $35,400 in 2017, above the industry average of $31,600.\nFord reported a 0.9 percent increase in sales for December, fueled by a 17 percent increase in fleet sales. The No. 2 U.S. automaker said its retail sales were down 4 percent.\nGM shares closed up 2.4 percent, Ford shares ended up 0.8 percent and Fiat Chrysler closed up 2.4 percent.\nFiat Chrysler posted an 11 percent sales decrease, with retail sales dropping 3 percent. Fleet sales slumped 42 percent, in line with a company strategy over the last year to cut back on this low-margin way to unload product.\nToyota Motor Corp said its sales fell 8.3 percent in December, with decreases across all segments.\nHonda Motor Co Ltd posted a 7 percent drop in sales in December, driven mostly by declining passenger car sales.\nNissan Motor Co Ltd reported a 9.5 percent drop in sales.

Industry watchers had figured that the futures trading would provide the key impetus for regulators to approve bitcoin ETFs, as it would set a concrete price level for valuing the funds. \nBut that has not proven to be the case as regulators continue to push back on bitcoin ETF plans. \nOn Monday, trusts controlled by Rafferty Asset Management and Exchange Traded Concepts both said they were canceling three bitcoin-related funds. A filing for one of the funds indicated that SEC staff had \"expressed concerns regarding the liquidity and valuation\" of the futures contracts. \nIn its letter, ProShares merely said its move \"is being made in response to a request from the Staff.\" The firm had proposed funds that would have allowed investors to bet both for and against bitcoin. ETFs trade like stocks and would give retail investors another avenue to get in on the burgeoning digital currency trade, in which bitcoin's price has exploded more than 1,500 percent higher over the past year. \nProShares is the 10th-largest provider of ETFs, with $29.5 billion under management in the $3.5 trillion industry. \nThe withdrawals came just days after Direxion Asset Management proposed a set of ETFs that would use leverage to allow investors to capture multiples of the bitcoin futures' performance. The funds would deliver 1, 1.25, 1.5 and 2 times the return, either higher or lower. One strategist called the proposal \"insane\" and another said it was \"eye-watering.\" \nDirexion has just shy of $13 billion worth of ETFs under management.

FILE PHOTO: A man wearing a respiratory protection mask walks toward an office building during the smog after a red alert was issued for heavy air pollution in Beijing's central business district, China, December 21, 2016. REUTERS\/Jason Lee\/File Photo \nResearchers examined data on birth defects for almost 290,000 infants born in Ohio from 2006 to 2010, matching these records with air pollution measurements near mothers\u2019 homes. \nThey focused on what\u2019s known as fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter that\u2019s found in traffic exhaust and can include dust, dirt, soot, and smoke. \nHigher levels of PM 2.5 exposure in the month before and after pregnancy were associated with a small but statistically meaningful increased risk of congenital birth defects, the study found. \n\u201cOur study indicates that there are several particularly vulnerable exposure periods near the time of conception, both before and after conception, in which exposure to higher levels of particulate matter in the air may pose an increased chance for a birth defect to occur,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Emily DeFranco of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in Ohio. \nThe impact of particulate matter on birth defects varied based on how far women lived from air quality monitoring stations. \nOverall, when researchers looked at every mother in the study, women were exposed to average PM 2.5 levels of 13.79 micrograms per cubic meter of air (ug\/m3) during the months just before and after they conceived. This included women who lived within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of an air quality monitoring station. \nWhen researchers looked at a subset of women who lived within 5 kilometers of a monitoring station, they found that for every 10 ug\/m3 increase in PM 2.5 levels women experienced during the month after conception, their babies were 19 percent more to be born with birth defects. \nCertain types of birth defects appeared more strongly connected to air pollution, including abdominal malformations and what\u2019s known as hypospadias, an abnormality in boys that occurs when the opening of the urethra doesn\u2019t develop on the tip of the penis and instead forms on the shaft or on the scrotum. \nAt the time of the study, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standard for particulate matter levels was 15 ug\/m3, while the current standard is 12 ug\/m3, researchers note in the Journal of Pediatrics. \n\u201cOur study results support the importance of public health education and initiatives to minimize population exposure to airborne pollutants,\u201d DeFranco said. \nThe study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how mothers\u2019 exposure to air pollution might influence the odds of birth defects in their babies. The study also only examined air pollution near women\u2019s homes, and not necessarily near where they worked or spent the most time outdoors. \nEven so, it makes sense for women to limit their exposure to air pollution whenever possible whether by avoiding outdoor commutes during rush hour or concentrating on indoor air quality, said Dr. Shruthi Mahalingaiah, an environmental health researcher at Boston University who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \n\u201cIf you live in areas of the world with high levels of ambient air pollution, you may consider installing appropriate air or ventilation systems so that your in-home air quality is excellent,\u201d Mahalingaiah advised. \u201cIdeally, working together with policy makers, companies, and nations to reduce emissions and innovate around sequestering current levels of emissions would be a goal.\u201d \nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2E47lqR Journal of Pediatrics, online December 10, 2017."}
{"published":"2018-01-05T14:30:00.000+02:00","title":"Cal-Maine Foods Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results","text":"JACKSON, Miss.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ: CALM) today reported results for the second quarter and twenty-six weeks ended December 2, 2017.\nNet sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $361.2 million, a 42.4 percent increase, compared to $253.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company reported a net loss of $26.1 million, or $0.54 per basic and diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to net loss of $23.0 million, or $0.48 per basic and diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 include a charge of $52.8 million, or $1.09 per basic and diluted share, after tax, related to the settlement of previously disclosed antitrust claims that several large direct action purchasers had asserted against the Company. Excluding this item, net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $26.6 million, or $0.55 per basic and diluted share.\nFor the twenty-six weeks ended December 2, 2017, net sales were $624.0 million compared with $493.4 million for the prior-year period. The Company reported a net loss of $42.1 million, or $0.87 per basic and diluted share, for the twenty-six weeks ended December 2, 2017, compared with a net loss of $53.9 million, or $1.12 per basic and diluted share, for the year-earlier period. Excluding the item described above, net income for the twenty-six weeks ended December 2, 2017, was $10.7 million, or $0.22 per basic and diluted share.\nDolph Baker, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., stated, \u201cAt the end of 2017, we reached an agreement on material terms of the settlement of antitrust lawsuits that several large purchasers had filed nearly a decade ago against the Company and many other egg producers. While we deny any liability in these cases and still believe that our conduct has always been lawful, we decided that it was in the best interests of our shareholders, customers, and employees to settle these long-standing cases at this time. This settlement eliminates the substantial risk, uncertainty, expense, and distraction associated with continuing the litigation against these purchasers. While the charge related to this settlement affected our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we had a solid operating performance during the quarter.\u201d\nPursuant to the agreement, which the parties intend to be legally binding, the Company agreed to pay $80.8 million after all parties sign a formal settlement agreement, which the parties agreed to work in good faith to execute no later than January 10, 2018. The settlement does not affect the remaining previously disclosed antitrust claims, which consist of claims of indirect purchasers of shell eggs (who have twice failed in efforts to certify a class) and the dismissed claims of non-class purchasers of egg products (who have appealed this dismissal).\nBaker continued, \u201cOur results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 reflect a significant improvement in egg market conditions compared with the second quarter last year. Our sales were up 42.4 percent, as we benefitted from higher market prices and solid demand trends. We are pleased with our ability to execute our strategy and capitalize on market opportunities with a profitable performance.\n\u201cMarket prices for conventional shell eggs continued to move higher throughout the quarter with our average customer selling prices for all eggs and conventional eggs up 36.0 percent and 77.6 percent, respectively, in the second quarter compared with a year ago. Market prices remained strong through the Thanksgiving holiday. According to Nielsen data, retail demand has been very good and in line with normal seasonal trends, supported by increased egg promotions in grocery stores. After a period of sluggish demand from institutional food customers, this sector has returned to more egg usage. The USDA reports that shell egg exports have continued to expand in calendar 2017 and have recovered from previous low levels following the 2015 avian influenza (AI) outbreak. Export demand has also increased as a result of the reported Fipronil contaminations across Europe and Southeast Asia. Together, these demand trends have resulted in a more favorable market environment compared with a year ago. The laying hen flock size has been consistent with prior-year levels as production has moderated, resulting in an improved balance of supply and demand. Recent USDA reports, however, show an increase in chicks hatched, which could indicate future increases in supply.\n\u201cSpecialty eggs, excluding co-pack sales, accounted for 22.6 percent of our total sales volume for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with 22.4 percent for the same period a year ago. Specialty egg revenue was 32.3 percent of total shell egg revenue, compared with 45.8 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The average selling price for specialty eggs was 5.0 percent lower compared with the second quarter of last year. However, our volumes were higher for the second quarter, with total specialty egg dozens sold up 5.3 percent over the prior-year period.\n\u201cWe have continued to position Cal-Maine Foods to take full advantage of the current and expected growth opportunities for specialty eggs. As reported, many food service providers, national restaurant chains and major retailers, including our largest customers, have made public commitments to transition away from conventional eggs and exclusively offer cage-free eggs by future specified dates. We are focused on meeting our customers\u2019 needs through this transition period. Cal-Maine Foods offers a favorable product mix that includes cage-free eggs, as well as other healthy and affordable options for consumers including conventional, nutritionally enhanced and organic eggs.\u201d\nBaker added, \u201cOur operations ran well throughout this fall and our managers worked hard to maintain efficient production, especially in our Florida, Georgia and Texas locations affected by the hurricanes early in the second quarter. Operating loss for the second quarter was $40.5 million, including the impact of the $80.8 million legal settlement expense. Excluding the impact of legal settlement expense, our operating income was $40.3 million. Farm production costs per dozen were consistent with the prior-year period. For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, our feed costs per dozen produced were slightly lower than a year ago. Looking ahead, this year\u2019s USDA harvest estimates indicate we should have an ample supply of our primary feed ingredients for the year.\u201d\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax reform legislation. While the Company continues to assess the impact of the tax reform legislation on its business and consolidated financial statements, the legislation does reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate from the current rate of 35 percent to 21 percent. At December 2, 2017, the Company had a deferred tax liability of approximately $75.3 million based on a U.S. federal tax rate of 35 percent. Since this legislation was enacted after the close of the Company's second quarter of fiscal 2018, this liability will be revalued at a lower rate during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which ends on March 3, 2018"}

REUTERS\/Abir Sultan\/Pool Netanyahu\u2019s public comments appeared to reflect a desire to show support for a major ally, but also concern that choking off funds would deepen Palestinian hardship and could put Israel and militants on a course for war.\nWith Palestinians seething over U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recognition last month of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, he threatened on Tuesday to withhold aid money, accusing them of being \u201cno longer willing to talk peace\u201d.\nOn Friday, in a report denied by a State Department official, the Axios news site said Washington had frozen $125 million in funding for UNRWA. The U.N. agency, founded in 1949 to aid Palestinian refugees, is a main provider of educational and health services in the Gaza Strip.\nNetanyahu said UNRWA was \u201can organisation that perpetuates the Palestinian problem.\u201d\n\u201cIt also enshrines the narrative of the so-called \u2018right of return\u2019. Therefore, UNRWA should pass from the world,\u201d he told a weekly cabinet meeting.\nNetanyahu made almost identical comments about dismantling UNRWA in June - a message he said at the time he had conveyed to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\nPraising Trump\u2019s \u201ccritical approach\u201d on the aid issue, Netanyahu steered clear of advocating a suspension of funding for the Palestinians. He said U.N. money for them should be transferred gradually to its global refugee agency UNHCR \u201cwith clear criteria for supporting genuine refugees and not fictitious ones, as is happening today under UNRWA.\u201d\nChris Gunness, an UNRWA spokesman, said the refugee crisis was being perpetuated by \u201cfailure of the parties to deal with the issue...\u201d\n\u201cUNRWA is mandated by the General Assembly to continue with its services until a just and lasting solution is found for the Palestine refugees,\u201d Gunness said in a statement.\nPalestinian officials have said Trump\u2019s declaration on Jerusalem, overturning decades of U.S. policy, meant he could not serve as an honest broker in peace negotiations that Washington has been trying to revive, and they condemned his remarks on a funding halt as blackmail.\nPalestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\nThe United States is the largest donor to UNRWA, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to the organisation\u2019s website. Gunness said the agency had not been \u201cinformed directly of a formal decision either way by the U.S. administration\u201d on cuts.\nIn addition to its services in Gaza, UNRWA operates in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.\nediting by John Stonestreet\n "}

This year, there was none of the uneasiness that marked that speech and his subsequent public addresses.\nHis voice, his hair shaved on the side, as well as his light-colored Western-style suit and glasses, were also reminiscent of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, according to defectors and analysts. Kim Il Sung had a more gregarious and popular image than Kim Jong Un\u2019s reclusive father, Kim Jong Il.\nKim Jong Un has embraced New Year addresses as a chance to outline his policies and rally the North Korean people. Last year, he used his speech to declare that North Korea was in the \u201cfinal stages\u201d of perfecting an intercontinental ballistic missile.\nKim Gun-hee, a consultant on image making and leadership, said the grey suit may have been designed to deflect some of the negative global attention Kim\u2019s nuclear and missile tests have prompted.\n\u201cWhen we advise clients who are in tough situations or are surrounded by unfavourable rumours, we tell them to wear either white or grey,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn the study of color psychology, white imbues innocence while grey tends to take attention away from you.

It sparked a discussion about rampant sexism in Silicon Valley, and Google said that portions of the memo were contrary to the company's \"basic values\" and Code of Conduct.\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in the Santa Clara Superior Court on Monday, alleges that Google \"discriminated against employees for their perceived conservative political views,\" as well as due to their \"male gender\" and \"Caucasian race\" and then \"systematically punished\" them. David Gudeman \u2014 another former Google employee, who was fired in December 2016 \u2014 is also listed as a plaintiff. The suit alleges that he was fired for his comments on a coworker's thread about being targeted by the FBI for his religion.\nThe lawsuit seeks to represent all Google employees who have been discriminated against for being male, Caucasian or conservative and seeks monetary, non-monetary and punitive damages.\n\"Google employees who expressed views deviating from the majority view at Google on political subjects raised in the workplace and relevant to Google's employment policies and its business, such as 'diversity' hiring policies, 'bias sensitivity,' or 'social justice' were\/are singled out, mistreated, and systematically punished and terminated from Google, in violation of their legal rights,\" the lawsuit states.\nThe suit also alleges that Google has \"open hostility for conservative thought,\" that Damore and others were \"ostracized, belittled and punished\" for their views, that the company is an \"ideological echo chamber\" that uses \"illegal hiring quotas\" at the expense of white males.\nThe lawsuit comes after Damore has spent the several months since his firing talking to press about discrimination and how Google \"betrayed\" him , including one conversation where he compared being a conservative at Google to \" being gay in the 1950s .\"\nDuring a press conference , Harmeet K. Dhillon, the lawyer representing the case, said that Google isn't the only company guilty of this kind of prejudice and that she hopes that the lawsuit will act as a wake-up call for Silicon Valley where the \"only acceptable form of discrimination\" is against \"conservatives and white men.\"\nMeanwhile, Google is also facing a class-action lawsuit for gender pay discrimination .\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nRead the full document, on Scribd, here ."}

(NYSE American: PARR) (\" Par Pacific \") announced today that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Par Petroleum, LLC has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 33 Cenex \u00ae Zip Trip convenience stores from CHS Inc. for approximately $70 million plus the agreed value of inventory at closing. Par Pacific anticipates Adjusted EBITDA from the acquired stores to be approximately $7.0 to $7.5 million in the first full year of operations. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and other approvals.\n\"We are pleased to begin 2018 with a strategic acquisition to complement our Wyoming refining and logistics activities. We anticipate that this acquisition will be immediately accretive to our Adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow and further diversify our earnings profile,\" said William Pate, Par Pacific's President and Chief Executive Officer.\nAs part of the transaction, the parties will enter into a multi-year branded petroleum marketing agreement for the continued supply of Cenex-branded refined products to the Cenex \u00ae Zip Trip stores. In addition, the parties also will enter into a multi-year supply agreement pursuant to which an affiliate of Par Pacific will supply refined products to CHS within the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Northwest markets.\nConference Call\nA conference call to discuss this acquisition is scheduled for Wednesday, January 10, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Central Time (12:00 p.m. Eastern Time). To access the call, please dial 877-404-9648 inside the U.S. or 412\u2011902\u20110030 outside the U.S. and ask for the Par Pacific call.

Par Pacific's strategy is to identify, acquire and operate energy and infrastructure companies with attractive competitive positions. Par Pacific owns and operates one of the largest energy infrastructure networks in Hawaii with a 94,000-bpd refinery, a logistics network supplying the major islands of the state and 91 retail locations. In Wyoming, Par Pacific owns a refinery and associated logistics network in a niche market. Par Pacific also owns 42.3% of Laramie Energy, LLC which has natural gas operations and assets concentrated in the Piceance Basin in Western Colorado.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nOur estimate of Adjusted EBITDA cannot be reconciled to our Projected Net Income, the closest GAAP measure, without unreasonable efforts. This reconciliation would require estimating amounts that will ultimately be determined in the purchase price allocation, which has not yet been completed, such as depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense and other financing costs, net. A purchase price allocation requires allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets, including property, fixed assets and intangibles based on their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. Our estimate of Adjusted EBITDA is based upon the prior twelve months financial statements of CHS Inc. related to the assets and the following key assumptions: (i) closing of the acquisition in the first quarter of 2018; and (ii) the operation of the 33 stores with forecasted Adjusted Gross Margin of approximately $25 to $27 million during a twelve month period.\nAdjusted Gross Margin is defined as (i) operating income (loss) plus operating expense (excluding depreciation), DD&A, impairment expense, inventory valuation adjustments (which adjusts for timing differences to reflect the economics of our inventory financing agreements, including lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, the impact of the embedded derivative repurchase obligation, and purchase price allocation adjustments), and unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives or (ii) revenues less cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) less inventory valuation adjustments and unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives. We define cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) as the hydrocarbon-related costs of inventory sold, transportation costs of delivering product to customers, crude oil consumed in the refining process, costs to satisfy our RINS obligations and certain hydrocarbon fees, and taxes. Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) also includes the unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives and inventory valuation adjustments that we exclude from Adjusted Gross Margin.\nFree Cash Flow is defined as cash provided by (used in) operations less capital expenditures. We believe Free Cash Flow is a useful supplemental financial measure to evaluate our ability to generate cash to repay our indebtedness or make discretionary investments. Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income as a measure of our financial performance and net cash provided by (used in) operations as a measure of our liquidity. Free Cash Flow presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation as other companies may define these terms differently.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes certain \" \" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to qualify for the \"safe harbor\" from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, statements with respect to the timing and completion of the CHS Inc. retail asset acquisition (the \" Acquisition \"), the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the Acquisition, the anticipated financial and operating results of the Acquisition and the effect on Par Pacific's cash flows and profitability (including Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and Adjusted earnings per share), and Par Pacific's plans for financing the proposed acquisition, the conditions to the closing of the Acquisition and the possibility that the Acquisition will not close, are .

They also want changes in the rules to address lower gas prices and a shift in U.S. consumer preferences to larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles.\n\"We've had productive conversations under way with CARB and I would hope those conversations continue to be productive,\" Wehrum said in an interview Friday at EPA headquarters. \"I think a shared goal is to maintain one national program.\"\nIn 2011, California's air emissions regulator and the Obama administration reached an agreement with major automakers to nearly double average fleetwide fuel efficiency to more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025, but included a \"midterm review\" to determine by April 2018 whether the final requirements were feasible.\nCalifornia, joined by nearly a dozen other states, could seek to enforce its own current stricter emissions rules even if the Trump administration softens the 2022-2025 requirements.\nThe Obama administration announced it had completed the midterm review in its final days in January 2017 without making changes.\nIn a move widely seen as a preamble to loosening fuel standards, U.S. President Donald Trump announced in March he was revisiting the 2025 requirements. \"The assault on the American auto industry is over,\" Trump said. \"We are going to ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs, your factories.\"\nWehrum said if there was a \"good solid technical basis\" for revising the requirements, he hoped California would agree, adding the talks have been \"very collegial and collaborative,\" including that the December 15 meetings with California officials lasted for a couple of hours. He emphasized EPA has made no decisions on whether the requirements should be lowered.\nCARB spokesman Stanley Young confirmed the discussion but declined to elaborate. Catanzaro did not respond to a request for comment.\nNHTSA has said it plans to issue its proposed changes, if any, for the 2022-25 model years by March 30. NHTSA's King declined to comment Monday on the status of the agency's review or California talks. Regulators could also propose changes for 2021.\nIn June, New York states attorney general and 12 other top state law officials said they would mount a court challenge to any effort to roll back vehicle fuel rules.\nGloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co , Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG and others, said the companies \"fully support conversations between all the relevant parties.\" (Reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Diane Craft)"}

Aqua was to use its breakthrough technology to yield nearly 100% lead recovery through a non-polluting process. On August 2, 2016, Aqua announced the opening of its first AquaRefinery, which it coined as the \"world's first environmentally friendly process to recycle lead-acid batteries.\" Throughout the latter half of 2016 and early 2017, Aqua continued to tout the positive impact of its AquaRefinery, its budding relationships with other battery suppliers, and the possibility of expansion. However, Aqua officials ignored unresolved deficiencies in the company's AquaRefine technology, which it began to reveal in May 2017, and hid from investors that the company was unprofitable because it was unable to generate revenue from its core business. On October 23, 2017, Aqua revealed that it was only producing \"small quantities\" of lead. Then, on November 9, 2017, Aqua reported a net loss of $6.3 million, compared to a net loss of $3.5 million for the previous year's comparable quarter, disclosing that it was still overcoming \"significant challenges.\" As news of Aqua's troubles became public, the company's stock fell nearly 82%, eventually closing at $3.00 per share on November 14, 2017.

Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index fell 0.65 percent after 11 consecutive days of gains, pressured by blue-chips such as lender Ita\u00fa Unibanco Holding SA and miner Vale SA . Mexico's benchmark index S&P\/BMV IPC dropped 0.58 percent, hit by Wal-Mart de Mexico. Although Walmex shares reached a record high on Monday after releasing December sales data, they slipped 3.41 percent on Tuesday. Analysts said they expect little upside potential due to the already high valuations, with some saying that December sales failed to meet expectations. Latin American currencies also weakened as the U.S. dollar rebounded from an early 2018 sell-off that drove it to the lowest in more than three months. Currencies from Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Colombia slipped between 0.06 percent and 0.43 percent on Tuesday. Emerging market currencies had rallied early in the year as solid economic growth figures drove investors away from the greenback and toward riskier assets. That move faded in recent days as expectations grew stronger that the U.S. Federal Reserve will increase rates three times in 2018, potentially draining funds away from high-yielding assets.

Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., and other progressives have called for Medicare to be expanded to cover every American , replacing the current health-coverage system, which is a hodgepodge of private and public insurance plans.\nObamacare is just one, relatively small part of that system.\nThe health-care law since 2013 has expanded coverage to about 20 million people, primarily by expanding access to Medicaid, which covers primarily poor adults, and by subsidizing the purchase of private insurance plans for others.\nWhile Obamacare was promoted by a Democratic president, Barack Obama , and approved by a Democratic-controlled Congress, many on the left were disappointed the law did not achieve their goal of universal health coverage.\nMore than 12 percent of U.S. adults still lack health insurance, despite Obamacare. \nAccording to Wolff's book, Trump after winning election appeared open to the idea of using an existing government program other than Obamacare to reduce that uninsured rate.\n\"'Why can't Medicare simply cover everybody?' he had impatiently wondered aloud during one discussion with aides, all of whom were careful not to react to this heresy,\" Wolff wrote.\nThe book says that Steve Bannon , a top Trump advisor at the time, \"held the line, insisting, sternly, that Obamacare was a litmus Republican issue, and that, holding a majority in Congress, they could not face Republican voters without having made good on the now Republican catechism of repeal.\"\nBannon believed repeal would \"be the most satisfying\" policy goal for the new Trump administration.\n\"It would also be the easiest one to achieve, since virtually every Republican was already publicly committed to voting for repeal,\" the book says.\nWolff writes that Trump was visited at his estate in Bedminster, New Jersey, by House Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis., and then Rep. Tom Price , R-Ga., for a briefing on a plan for repealing and replacing Obamacare with a new law.\n\"The two men summed up for Trump \u2014 who kept wandering off topic and trying to turn the conversation to golf \u2014 seven years of Republican legislative thinking about Obamacare and Republican alternatives.\"\nTrump ended up endorsing the repeal-and-replace effort, which despite Bannon's confidence repeatedly failed to win approval by Congress last year. \nPrice became Trump's secretary of Health and Human Services , but resigned in September after exposure of his habit of taking pricey charter jet flights at taxpayers' expense instead of flying commercial. \nWATCH: Bernie Sanders calls for Medicare for all show chapters What Sen.

The move broadens an investigation that began with a 4-year-old case against a franchisee in Long Island, New York. The action appears to open a new front in Trump's sharp expansion of immigration enforcement, which has already brought a 40 percent increase in deportation arrests. Published 1 Hour Ago SHARES Chris Carlson | AP U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents serve an employment audit notice at a 7-Eleven convenience store Wednesday, Jan. 10, 2018, in Los Angeles. Agents said they targeted about 100 7-Eleven stores nationwide Wednesday to open employment audits and interview workers. \nU.S. immigration agents descended on dozens of 7-Eleven stores before dawn Wednesday to open employment audits and interview workers in what officials described as the largest operation against an employer under Donald Trump 's presidency. \nAgents targeted about 100 stores nationwide, broadening an investigation that began with a 4-year-old case against a franchisee on New York 's Long Island. The audits could lead to criminal charges or fines over the stores' hiring practices. \nThe action appears to open a new front in Trump's sharp expansion of immigration enforcement, which has already brought a 40 percent increase in deportation arrests and plans to spend billions of dollars on a border wall with Mexico . Hardliners have been pressing for a tougher stance on employers. \nDerek Benner, a top official at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told The Associated Press that Wednesday's operation was \"the first of many\" and \"a harbinger of what's to come\" for employers. He said there would be more employment audits and investigations, though there is no numerical goal. show chapters 1:46 PM ET Tue, 9 Jan 2018 | 02:35 \n\"This is what we're gearing up for this year and what you're going to see more and more of is these large-scale compliance inspections, just for starters. From there, we will look at whether these cases warrant an administrative posture or criminal investigation,\" said Benner, acting head of ICE's Homeland Security Investigations, which oversees cases against employers. \n\"It's not going to be limited to large companies or any particular industry, big medium and small,\" he said. \"It's going to be inclusive of everything that we see out there.\" \n7-Eleven Stores Inc., based in Irving, Texas, with more than 8,600 stores in the U.S., didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment. \nThough agents arrested 21 people suspected of being in the country illegally during Wednesday's sweep, the action was aimed squarely at management. \nIllegal hiring is rarely prosecuted, partly because investigations are time-consuming and convictions are difficult to achieve because employers can claim they were duped by fraudulent documents or intermediaries. Administrative fines are discounted by some as a business cost. \nGeorge W. Bush 's administration aggressively pursued criminal investigations against employers in its final years with dramatic pre-dawn shows of force and large numbers of worker arrests. In 2008, agents arrived by helicopter at the Agriprocessors meatpacking plant in Postville, Iowa, and detained nearly 400 workers. Last month, Trump commuted the 27-year prison sentence of Sholom Rubashkin, former chief executive of what was the nation's largest kosher meatpacking operation. \nBarack Obama 's administration more than doubled employer audits to more than 3,100 a year in 2013, shunning Bush's flashier approach. John Sandweg, an acting ICE director under Obama, said significant fines instilled fear in employers and draining resources from other enforcement priorities. \nTrump is pursuing \"its own kind of unique strategy\" tied to its broader emphasis on fighting illegal immigration, including enforcement on the border, Benner said. Some workers may get arrested in the operations but authorities are targeting employers because they are job magnets for people to come to the country illegally. \n\"We need to make sure that employers are on notice that we are going to come out and ensure that they're being compliant,\" Benner said \"For those that don't, we're going to take some very aggressive steps in terms of criminal investigations to make sure that we address them and hold them accountable.\" \nWednesday's operation resulted from a 2013 investigation that resulted in charges against nine 7-Eleven franchisees and managers in New York and Virginia. Eight have pleaded guilty and were ordered to pay more than $2.6 million in back wages, and the ninth was arrested in November. \nIn the 2013 investigations, managers used more than 25 stolen identities to employ at least 115 people in the country illegally, knowing they could pay below minimum wage, according to court documents. The documents say 7-Eleven corporate office does automated payroll, requiring franchisees provide employee names and Social Security numbers to pay workers through direct deposit or check. \nThe 7-Eleven stores served on Wednesday will be required to produce documents showing they required work authorization, which Benner said will become more common. Audits may lead to criminal charges or administrative penalties. \nIn Los Angeles' Koreatown, seven agents arriving in three unmarked cars closed a store for 20 minutes to explain the audit to the only employee there, a clerk with a valid green card. Agents, wearing blue jackets marked ICE, told arriving customers that the store was closed briefly for a federal inspection. A driver delivering cases of beer was told to wait in the parking lot. \nThe manager was in Bangladesh and the owner, reached by phone, told the clerk to accept whatever documents were served. Agents said they would return Tuesday for employment records they requested. \nNeither 7-Eleven nor was its parent company, Seven & i Holding . based in Tokyo, was charged in that case. \n\"Just as the IRS performs audits of people all the time of their tax returns, the same purpose here is to ensure a culture of compliance in this area,\" he said.

Its escalating series of missile tests over the past year has sparked talk of war on the divided peninsula.\nBehind the scenes, the logistics of bringing hundreds of North Korean officials, athletes, cheerleaders and artistic performers is a challenge for both sides, officials and analysts say.\nBesides the basics of securing transportation and other accommodations, South Korean officials are keen to ensure the Olympics go off without a hitch. That also means preventing any controversy over the North Korean visitors, including protecting them from possible attacks by extremist South Korean groups.\nSouth Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said on Wednesday it hopes to hold working-level talks soon to sort out details of the visit.\nRyu Se-yeong, head of Allami Korea, one of the private security firms hired for the Games, said he was concerned about the lack of lead time to prepare for additional security for North Koreans, the vehicles and places to house the visitors.\n\u201cSome of the hotels are already fully booked. I am worried where to accommodate such a large number of North Korean people. It is not easy to secure decent accommodations near the stadiums,\u201d Ryu said.\nSouth Korean police have started preparations based on past experiences, which can be updated once North Korea provides its detailed plans, an official from South Korea\u2019s National Policy Agency said.\nAVOIDING EMBARRASSMENT With Pyongyang and Seoul hoping to use the Olympics to signify a thaw in inter-Korean relations, both governments share fears that a member of the delegation could try to defect.\n\u201cThe North will choose and send verified people from its core class,\u201d said Kim Kwang-jin, a North Korean defector and researcher at the Institute for National Security Strategy.\n\u201cThe North is also expected to divide its delegation into groups and ask them to monitor and control each other so that no one would leave the group,\u201d he said.\nThe Olympics would be a \u201cgood opportunity\u201d for the North to sneak spies into the South, and contact other spies already operating in the neighboring country, he added.\nResponding to that, a unification ministry spokesman told Reuters: \u201cWe will try our utmost to ensure security and safety so that the Olympics will take place smoothly.\u201d\nPhotographers take photographs of a giant inflatable ball bearing the logo of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in Incheon, South Korea, November 1, 2017. REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji North Korean athletes have previously participated three times in international multi-sport events hosted by South Korea - in 2002, 2003 and 2014 - but all those visits were scheduled far in advance.\nFor the 2002 Asian Games held in the southeastern port city of Busan, North Korea sent a 606-member delegation, including 184 athletes, 288 cheerleaders and 134 officers, by far the largest delegation. Cheerleaders traveled via a cruise ship, using the vessel as their accommodation.\nWhile there have been no known cases of North Koreans defecting during past games in South Korea, the South is expected to keep a close watch on them, said Hong Hyun-ik, a senior research fellow at Seoul\u2019s Sejong Institute.\n\u201dA defection of a single North Korean could pose a serious problem for inter-Korean relations,\u201d he said.\nTRAVEL AND ACCOMMODATION The exact size of the North\u2019s delegation and its travel route to Pyeongchang, just 80 km (49.71 miles) away from the heavily-fortified border between North and South Korea, have yet to be determined, the South\u2019s unification ministry said.\nBut a source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the ministry expects the North Korean delegation to be comprised of 450 to 500 people, without providing details.\nOnly a figure skating pair from North Korea was qualified for the Games, but they missed the registration deadline in November. Still, the figure skaters and several other North Korean athletes could qualify through special places offered by the Olympic body.\nOfficials have said they are considering a number of travel possibilities, including a cruise ship, a flight or a land route across the heavily militarized border.\n\u201cWhat we suggested to the North in December was sending a cruise ship because that could solve both accommodation and security,\u201d said Kim Kyung-sung, chairman of a Seoul-based inter-Korean sports association, who met North Korean officials in December.\n\u201cA cruise ship is available for up to 1,500 people, but in case they refuse to take a cruise, Gangwon province has prepared for separate accommodation,\u201d he said.\nA spokesman for SkyBay Gyeongpo Hotel, one of the official accommodations in the city of Gangneung, where some of the Olympic events would be held, said the hotel had reserved some rooms for a possible North Korean delegation at the request of International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials.\nHe declined to give further details on the number of reserved rooms or when the IOC had contacted the hotel, noting that negotiations were continuing.\n\u201cThere are numerous available hotels here, but security is a bit of a concern,\u201d said an official at Gangwon Province, which will host the Olympics.\nReporting By Hyunjoo Jin and Jane Chung; Additionaly reporting by Haejin Choi and Hyonhee Shin; Editing by Josh Smith and Bill Tarrant\n "}

Netflix jumped $7.63, or 4 percent, to $199.59.\nBONDS: Bond prices slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.46 percent from 2.41 percent. The yield on 2-year note rose to 1.91 percent from 1.89 percent.\nThe increase in bond yields sent high-dividend stocks like utilities, household goods makers and real estate companies lower.

If so, it will do it under new leadership, as Fed governor Jerome Powell will replace Chair Janet Yellen in February.\nFORCE-FUL PERFORMANCE: On the last day of the year, \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" surpassed \"Beauty and the Beast\" as the top grossing film in North America in 2017. Its gross will reach $1 billion in the next few days even before the movie opens in China. Both \"The Last Jedi\" and the live-action \"Beauty and the Beast\" were made by Disney, which rose $2.73, or 2.5 percent, to $110.24.\nNEW YEARS' RESOLUTION: Weight Watchers International climbed after it struck a deal with producer and recording artist DJ Khaled, who will represent the brand to millions of follows on Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Weight Watchers got a big boost a few years ago from a deal with Oprah Winfrey that also included a substantial investment in the company. Its stock added $2.11, or 4.8 percent, to $46.39.\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude dipped 20 cents to $60.22 a barrel in New York.

The dollar declined steadily in 2017 and the ICE U.S. dollar index slumped 10 percent, its biggest decline since 2003. The improved global economy was responsible for much of that decline, however, and the weaker dollar makes U.S. exports less expensive in other markets.\nOVERSEAS: Germany's DAX fell 0.2 percent and France's CAC 40 shed 0.4 percent. The British FTSE 100 retreated 0.6 percent.\nAsian markets mostly did better. A survey by Chinese business magazine Caixin found manufacturing grew in December at the fastest rate in four months.

FILE PHOTO - Pakistan's new finance ministry chief Miftah Ismail speaks with a Reuters correspondent during an interview in Islamabad, Pakistan December 28, 2017. Picture taken December 28, 2017. REUTERS\/Faisal Mahmood \nWashington plans to imminently slash \u201csecurity assistance\u201d to Pakistan, U.S. congressional aides told Reuters on Wednesday, although the type, scale and length of the cuts was unclear. A day earlier, the White House said it would suspend about $255 million (188.32 million pounds) in already delayed military assistance. \nTense ties between the uneasy allies nosedived on Jan. 1 when President Donald Trump lashed out on Twitter against Islamabad\u2019s \u201clies and deceit\u201d despite $33 billion in aid and the White House warned of \u201cspecific actions\u201d to pressurise Pakistan. \nA staunch U.S. Cold War ally and key player in the U.S.-backed invasion of Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Pakistan has watched warily as Washington has in recent years pivoted towards its arch-foe India. \nOver the past decade, U.S. threats to cut aid have been part and parcel of its frustrating relationship with Pakistan, a nation also seen as vital to the peace process in Afghanistan. \n\u201cAid cuts will not hurt us,\u201d Miftah Ismail, Pakistan\u2019s de facto finance minister, told Reuters. \n\u201cThat\u2019s not the leverage they have, because it is something they have reduced drastically over the years.\u201d \nPakistan received about $1 billion in U.S. assistance in 2016, down from a peak of about 3.5 billion in 2011, Pakistani and U.S. officials say. \nAbout $550 million of the 2016 total came from the Coalition Support Fund (CSF), a U.S. Defence Department programme to reimburse allies for the costs of supporting counter-terrorist and counter-insurgency operations. Pakistan was the largest recipient of such funds. \nThe remaining $450 million was a mix of military assistance and funds for international non-government bodies (NGOs) and other development programmes, Pakistan\u2019s finance ministry says. \nAnalysts say there are limits to how much the U.S. can fracture relations, since Pakistan cannot be isolated or completely sidelined, because of its proximity to, and influence in, Afghanistan. \n\u201cThere is really no way forward for the United States in Afghanistan without Pakistan playing some kind of cooperative and collaborative role,\u201d said Huma Yusuf, a Wilson Center Global Fellow. PART OF SOLUTION \nIslamabad worries that the United States, seeking to exert greater pressure on its ally, could in future train its crosshairs on Pakistan\u2019s fragile economy and impose some sort of financial sanctions. \nPakistani officials warn economic damage would weaken the country, proving counterproductive in Washington\u2019s battle against Islamist militant groups in South Asia. \n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how the U.S. financially or militarily hurts us and their own war effort doesn\u2019t get hurt,\u201d said Ismail, adding that it was impossible to find a solution to the Afghan conflict \u201cwithout Pakistan being part of it\u201d. \nLast year, U.S. officials said the options being discussed to push Pakistan to change its behaviour included targeted sanctions of officials with ties to militant groups waging an insurgency in Afghanistan. \nThe U.S. officials have also suggested the Pentagon may ramp up drone strikes, driving Pakistani media to speculate if such air attacks would be widened beyond areas bordering Afghanistan. \nIslamabad could \u201creview its cooperation if it is not appreciated\u201d, its United Nations representative, Maleeha Lodhi, told media this week, which many interpreted as a reference to the vital transport route ferrying supplies to U.S. troops in Afghanistan through Pakistan\u2019s territory. \nPakistan remains committed to friendly relations with the United States, its powerful army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa, told Capital TV on Wednesday, but warned Washington against \u201ccoercion\u201d, and vowed not to \u201ccompromise on our self-respect\u201d. \nPakistan supported the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s as a foil to Indian influence in Afghanistan, and analysts say its military and security services maintained ties long after the Taliban regime was toppled in 2001. \nToday the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network militants are effectively an arm of Pakistan\u2019s foreign policy, U.S. officials say. Pakistan staunchly denies using proxies. \nTies with the United States are likely to stay fraught as Pakistan\u2019s strategic calculus remains unchanged, said Raoof Hassan, executive director of the Islamabad-based Regional Peace Institute. \n\u201cAs long as Pakistan continues to consider the Afghan Taliban as a strategic asset, which it can use some time in the future to become more relevant and influential in Kabul, there is no meeting point,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThe positions are diametrically opposite.\u201d Additional reporting by Saad Sayeed in ISLAMABAD and Syed Raza Hassan in KARACHI; Writing by Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Clarence Fernandez"}

Also animal poop .\nRead more from Vox: \n2018 Golden Globes: 6 winners and 5 losers from the 75th annual awards\nMost images of black holes are illustrations. Here's what our telescopes actually capture. \nTrump postpones his fake \"Fake News Awards\" \nThe \"raw water\" trend \u2014 such as it is \u2014 fits into a larger movement that, first, embraces everything \"natural\" as healthy, and second, creates savvy entrepreneurs who find ways to make a lot of money from it. The Times article doesn't offer much detail on how many people are embracing this fad and actually buying and drinking overpriced, untreated spring water. But unproven, unscientific \"cures\" are a growth market \u2014 and debunkings often have little effect .\nTrue believers in \"raw water\" probably won't be convinced. One of the companies mentioned in the Times piece said there's already been a surge of demand. But at the risk of shouting into the void, we'll say it again: Drinking untreated spring water is a very, very bad idea.\nWhat is \"raw water\"? The \"raw water\" movement has been around for several years \u2014 it had its roots in the raw food movement \u2014 but it's been getting attention lately after companies started bottling and selling untreated spring water. In September , Doug Evans, the founder of Juicero, the startup that made that \"smart juicer\" the internet loved to mock , announced a five-day \"water fast\" in which he would only drink raw water.\n\"Raw\" water proponents say it contains healthy and natural minerals that get stripped out when tap water or bottled water is filtered and treated. One \"raw water\" adherent told the Times that after making the switch, she noticed her \"skin's plumper\" and she feels as if she's \"getting better nutrition from the food I eat.\"\nNow startups are capitalizing on the trend and selling \"raw water.\" Live Water bottles its water from a spring in Oregon, and the Times notes a few other startups \u2014 including Tourmaline Spring , based in Maine, and Zero Mass Water , which caters to people who want to collect water from the \"atmosphere around their homes.\"\n\"It has a vaguely mild sweetness, a nice smooth mouth feel, nothing that overwhelms the flavor profile,\" Kevin Freeman, a shift manager at the store that sells a 2.5-gallon bottle of \"raw water\" bottled by Live Water for $36.99, told the New York Times . \"Bottled water's controversial. We've curtailed our water selection. But this is totally outside that whole realm.\"\nCatherynne Valente tweet \nSo for \"raw water\" fans, the idea is that tap or bottled water is kind of the processed food \u2014 the Twinkies \u2014 of water, whereas \"raw water\" is all natural, if imperfect, and offers a unique taste and benefits. (It's also not exactly true that \"raw water\" is some coveted natural cure-all that modernity destroyed. As The Verge's Rachel Becker points out , societies have been attempting water treatment for centuries.)\n\"Tap water? You're drinking toilet water with birth control drugs in them,\" Mukhande Singh, the founder of the Live Water startup, told the Times . \"Chloramine, and on top of that they're putting in fluoride. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but it's a mind-control drug that has no benefit to our dental health.\"\nIt's true that trace amounts of prescription and over-the-counter medicines, and additives from shampoo and soap, can end up in water in low concentrations, but studies have shown that they aren't harmful to people in such small amounts.\nAnd the idea that fluoride is a mind control drug is a conspiracy theory with a long history. Before it was a \"mind-control drug,\" fluoride was suspected of being a communist plot. (It's neither. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers fluoridation to be one of its top 10 public health achievements of the past century because of its ability to help prevent tooth decay, particularly in kids and low-income Americans who might not have ready access to dental care.)\nDrinking untreated water is a very bad idea Let's state the obvious here: Water treatment removes bacteria, parasites, pesticides, and other contaminants, and drinking untreated water come with serious risks.\nIn the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency, via the Safe Drinking Water Act , originally passed in 1974 (and updated since), sets health guidelines for the public wells, reservoirs, and springs many Americans rely on. Overall in the US, outbreaks from water-associated diseases are low. A CDC report released this year calculated 42 drinking water\u2013associated outbreaks in 2013-'14, which caused 1,006 cases of illness, 124 hospitalizations, and 13 deaths. (The majority of the cases, and all of the deaths, were linked to Legionella , which causes Legionnaire's disease \u2014 spread through inhaling the bacteria.)\nMeanwhile, in the developing world, access to clean and sanitary water is a huge public health and human rights issue. Water-associated diseases such as cholera are still global threats. In 2017, an outbreak of cholera \u2014 which is spread by drinking water or eating food contaminated with a certain bacteria \u2014 reached 1 million suspected cases in Yemen, where a devastating famine has prevented access to clean water.\nIt is true that the United States has issues with its public water systems because of its aging infrastructure. The EPA has estimated the country will require a $384 billion investment in local water systems in the coming years to maintain clean water standards. And as many as 10 million lead pipes could still be in use, though Congress banned them three decades ago, according to the New York Times .

Parsons professor of law and business at Stanford Law School. \nBloomberg's report, prepared with University of Chicago law professor Daniel Hemel, estimated that California could protect $66.8 billion of its residents' tax deductions over the next eight years if it took steps to reform its tax code in light of the new law. The average SALT deduction in California in 2015 was $18,400. \nNew York could protect $50.6 billion in deductions, according to the article. \nIllinois could shield $16.8 billion in deductions, and New Jersey could protect $12.5 billion. \nConnecticut, where just 1.6 percent of residents claim SALT deductions, could protect $7.5 billion in deductions by making changes being contemplated for the tax code. \nAlthough Connecticut has a small population and relatively few taking the SALT deductions, the state has a disproportionate number of wealthy people, which is why the deductions at stake are so high there. \nConnecticut had the second-highest average SALT deduction in the nation, after New York, at $19,700.

They're handling a lot of it. \nKids ages 4 to 14 received an average $454 in allowance over the course of 2017, in addition to cash gifts for birthdays and holidays, according to a forthcoming survey from allowance tracker RoosterMoney . The average kid takes home around $8.74 a week. \nThe app polled 10,000 of its users. \nOffering an allowance is an opportunity to teach children how to spend and save . People form many of their financial habits by seven years old, a 2013 University of Cambridge study found. \nBut the way these payments are doled out and stored is changing. Apps like RoosterMoney, FamZoo and Threejars offer ways to digitize the allowance and induct children into the economy, which itself is becoming increasingly virtual. \n\"Parents are finding it harder to have conversations about money because they don't have cash around,\" said William Carmichael, CEO of RoosterMoney. \nParents are actually doing a disservice to their children by teaching them about finances solely via cash, Carmichael said. \n\"That's not the world their kids will live in,\" he said. \nHere are some tips to teach your kids about money in the age of screens. 1) Make digital currency feel real \nIt can be hard for a 5- or 6-year-old to understand what is happening when their parents swipe their credit cards at the grocery store. Parents should explain the process . \n\"Parents are the number one influence on how kids will spend their money,\" said Paul Golden, a spokesman for the National Endowment for Financial Education. \"You want to teach your kids when you go to the ATM, you're keeping the receipt, and how it comes off the bottom line.\" \nPiggy bank apps can also reinforce the consequences of spending. The FamZoo app, for example, sends a reminder text message to the child when they've purchased something. Parents can also require their child to gain permission from them before they buy something. \n\"That's putting the pain back into spending,\" said Bill Dwight, founder of FamZoo. 2) Reward saving \nMany of these online piggy banks allow parents to set an interest rate. The RoosterMoney app, for example, has a default rate of 9 percent. (In its user survey, they found that the average kid saves 43 percent of his allowance.) \n\"We might not be getting those rates with banks ,\" Carmichael said, \"but when you're six or seven [years old], you need to make it exciting.\" \nThe FamZoo app will notify children of their returns (paid, of course, by parents). \n\"We're trying to teach kids basic principles like compound interest,\" Dwight said. \nGolden said that parents need to \"understand their kid's financial personality,\" as well: One of his kids is a spender while the other is a saver. Recognizing a child's tendencies can help a parent realize what lessons they will need to reinforce. 3) Teach them \"the pain\" of debt \nChildren will learn to spend their money better if allowances are given out on a set schedule, Golden said. Many of the allowance apps allow parents to establish recurring disbursements. \n\"If they're only getting an allowance when they've done something good, that's not how the world works,\" he said. \"We want to teach them how to make ends meet.\" \nThe FamZoo app even allows children to receive loans from their parents, with a real-world cost. \n\"We model all the things adults see in the world with our child products,\" Dwight said. \nMore from Personal Finance:"}

Kuczynski said last week he would unveil a new cabinet soon, but has announced no details yet. \nA corrupt dictator to some and a misunderstood hero to others, Fujimori had been serving a 25-year sentence for graft and human rights crimes during his 1990-2000 rightwing populist government. \n\u201cTo the joy of many Peruvians, today Alberto Fujimori is free,\u201d his doctor, and former health minister, Alejandro Aguinaga, said on television channel Canal N, adding that Fujimori was still recovering from heart troubles. \nFujimori, 79, was trailed by police escorts and news cameras as he arrived at a sprawling house in the upscale district of La Molina in Lima, the Peruvian capital. \nIn a snapshot shared by his daughter on social media, Fujimori was seen in a garden surrounded by his four adult children - a sign of unity that fueled speculation he would end a political rivalry between siblings Keiko and Kenji. Former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori waves as he leaves in a car from the hospital Centenario in Lima, Peru, January 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Guadalupe Pardo \nWearing a jacket and blue shirt, a smiling Fujimori appeared alert as he waved to crowds outside the Lima hospital where he had been interned for what his doctor called life-threatening blood-pressure and heart problems on the eve of the pardon. \nKuczynski, a former investment banker who is 79, like Fujimori, cited the latter\u2019s ailing health when he pardoned him nearly two weeks ago. But the decision has been widely seen in Peru as payback after Fujimori enlisted his loyalists to help Kucyznski survive an impeachment bid following a graft scandal. Slideshow (3 Images) \n\u201cYou may have benefited improperly from an illegal pardon, but that does not take away your responsibility for the death and corruption of the 1990s,\u201d said human rights activist Gisela Ortiz, whose brother, a university student, was killed in a 1992 death squad massacre Fujimori had been convicted of commanding. \nEarlier on Thursday, Fujimori\u2019s supporters rallied in front of Kuczynski\u2019s house to show support for the pardon, as critics warned Kuczynski that he would be beholden to Fujimori and the rightwing party led by his children Keiko and Kenji that has an absolute majority in Congress. \nFujimori signaled from his hospital bed last week that he would not use his freedom to return to politics, but his loyalists have called for him to become an adviser to Popular Force, which controls a majority of seats in Congress. \n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with receiving advice from him, or counting on his support or counsel for a future presidential candidate,\u201d Popular Force lawmaker Maritza Garcia told Reuters last week. \u201cBecause of his health he can\u2019t lead the party, but he can direct it from his bed or wheelchair.\u201d Reporting by Guadalupe Pardo and Reuters TV; Additional reporting by Marco Aquino; Writing by Mitra Taj; Editing by Clarence Fernandez"}

Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May in Warsaw, Poland December 21, 2017. REUTERS\/Kacper Pempel \nAfter running a poorly-received campaign at a national election last year that badly damaged her authority, May is leading a delicately balanced minority government tasked with delivering Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. She is also under pressure to tackle a range of domestic policy problems. \nMay said ministerial changes were necessary following the departure of her long-standing ally and de-facto deputy prime minister Damian Green, who she forced to resign in December after he made misleading statements about pornography found on an office computer. \n\u201cObviously, Damian Green\u2019s departure before Christmas means that some changes do have to be made, and I will be making some changes,\u201d she told the BBC in an interview filmed on Saturday for broadcast on Sunday. \nMay said the reshuffle would come soon, but did not give any further details. \nThe Sunday Times said foreign minister Boris Johnson, finance minister Philip Hammond, interior minister Amber Rudd and Brexit minister David Davis would not lose their jobs in the reshuffle. The report did not cite its sources. \nMay is also expected to announce a new first secretary of state to replace Green - an important post with responsibility for maintaining unity in a cabinet still divided over the best approach to Brexit. \nThe Sunday Times said changes were aimed at bringing younger women and non-white lawmakers into the cabinet in attempt to appeal to improve the party\u2019s image and regenerate support among voters. \nMay also said she was abandoning plans to give lawmakers a vote on overturning a ban on fox hunting with dogs -- one of several promises she made during last year\u2019s snap election which went down badly with voters. \nMay earned plaudits in Europe and at home in December by securing progress in the complicated process of leaving the European Union, but her government has been criticised in recent days for rising rail fares and postponed hospital operations. \nThe Conservative Party is running neck and neck with the left-wing Labour Party in opinion polls and has been split by differences about what kind of relationship Britain should seek with the EU after it leaves the bloc in 2019. \nThe Sunday Times said the ministers who were expected to lose their jobs or move to different roles included Conservative Party chairman Patrick McLoughlin, education minister Justine Greening, business minister Greg Clark and Andrea Leadsom, the government\u2019s leader in the lower house of parliament.

His father is dead, he said.\n\"Pose,\" which stars Evan Peters, Kate Mara and James Van Der Beek, will debut this summer.

The network cut ties in November with C.K. after he admitted wrongdoing.\nAfter the comedian was accused by five women of sexual misconduct, Netflix scrapped plans for an upcoming Louis C.K. stand up special, the release of C.K.'s feature film \"I Love You, Daddy\" was shelved and HBO removed his work from its on demand video streaming service.\nC.K. has said the allegations are true and expressed remorse."}

Without the slowdown, the iPhones would suddenly shutdown when the aged batteries couldn\u2019t provide enough power for peak performance. Along with an apology, Apple said it would replace the battery on any model of the iPhone 6 or later for just $29. \nThe offer, and the resulting improvement in performance for older iPhones, may prompt millions of people to forgo an upgrade to a new phone this year, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz says. \u201cOur August Wireless survey suggests battery drain is No. 1 reason for users to upgrade to new device \u2013 therefore, a new battery may deter some upgrade intention,\u201d Moskowitz writes in a research note on Wednesday. The analyst, who says he is worried Wall Street is \u201ctoo optimistic\u201d about iPhone sales, rates Apple\u2019s stock \u201cneutral.\u201d \nAbout three-quarters of the 675 million iPhones currently in use would be eligible and potentially in need of the battery upgrade, Moskowitz estimates. \u201cDue to the large base, even a small percentage opting for battery replacement over upgrade could have meaningful impact on iPhone sales,\u201d the analyst writes. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. \nAssuming just 10% of those eligible take the offer, and about one-third of the battery seekers would have otherwise bought a new iPhone this year, then Apple will lose out on sales of 16 million devices and $10.3 billion of annual revenue, the Barclays analyst forecasts. If half the battery swaps would have otherwise upgraded, Apple loses out on 27 million sales and $18.2 billion in revenue. \nFor context, Wall Street assumes Apple will bring in $274 billion of revenue in its 2018 fiscal year, according to FactSet Research, including sales of 241 million iPhones. \nShares of Apple (aapl) were up 1% to $173.94 in midday trading on Wednesday.

Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of the ruling party Law and Justice, speaks during a joint news conference with Prime Minister Beata Szydlo at the party headquarters in Warsaw, Poland November 14, 2017. REUTERS\/Kacper Pempel \nThe march caught the attention of the world\u2019s media because some of the 60,000 participants carried banners bearing racist and xenophobic slogans such as \u201cpure blood, clear mind\u201d and \u201cEurope will be white or uninhabited\u201d. \nStalowa Wola\u2019s PiS mayor, Lucjusz Nadberezny, does \u201cnot regret the decision to support the trip\u201d. His office said in a statement the November Independence Day march was a \u201csafe and joyous manifestation of patriotism\u201d and that people from his town did not participate in any \u201cprovocations\u201d. \nA resurgence of far-right sentiment poses a dilemma for the PiS - a socially conservative group with a nationalist agenda. \nFar-right voters are a threat and an opportunity. The party tapped into frustration with western liberal values, when it won the 2015 election with the biggest majority by any party since the end of communism. \nIn other European states where anti-establishment right-wing slogans are also increasingly resonant, several far-right groups have got a foothold in power. \nBut in Poland they have had little success, or desire, to compete for office. This is in large part because the PiS has tailored its message across the spectrum of right-wing voters. \nThe activists from Stalowa Wola said they were going to Warsaw to express their opposition to \u201can invasion of immigrants and atheism in Europe\u201d. \nWhile several PiS officials said any racist slogans were few and unrepresentative, they also praised the march. \nForeign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said afterwards it fuelled \u201cpatriotic behaviour of Poles\u201d and any displays of xenophobia were \u201cincidents\u201d that were \u201cof course, reprehensible.\u201d \nHis comments were a typical PiS mix of patriotism with a general condemnation of racism and anti-Semitism. \nJaroslaw Kaczynski, the powerful leader of the PiS who has no formal position in government, said in 2015 that Middle East migrants could bring parasites and diseases to Poland. \nBut he also said that the racist banners at the march were \u201cdisgraceful rubbish\u201d and that the \u201cPolish tradition\u201d has nothing to do with racism or anti-Semitism. RISK OF BREAKAWAY GROUP \nThe PiS is mindful of the need to retain the support of all right-wing voters, including far-right, for elections in each of the next three years. \nIt is also wary of the risk of a breakaway, ultraconservative group emerging to challenge its majority in parliament. \nTadeusz Cymanski, deputy head of the PiS parliamentary caucus said it is better if far-right organisations such as ONR, which helped organise the Warsaw march, do not feel threatened by the PiS. \n\u201cIt is in the interest of democracy, in the interest of our state that extreme groups, either left or right-wing, have no representation in parliament,\u201d he told Reuters. \n\u201cAny association (of ONR with PiS) is painful and unpleasant, I reject it with shame, but I think it would be better even if I, or my faction, were associated with them rather than these forces were to gain in force.\u201d \nHe said the PiS is mindful that its 2015 election victory was fuelled in part by the fact that several smaller groups did not cross the election threshold, earning PiS extra seats in parliament. \nAnother outspoken PiS member, Ryszard Czarnecki, said the party gave all right-leaning voters a sense of belonging, in contrast to the previous centrist government which was seen as \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d. \n\u201cRight-wing voters have the feeling ... that we are a serious group, which has power, fulfils the right-wing agenda, so there is no need to escape towards the far right,\u201d he said. \n\u201cA number of young people now prefer to vote for PiS. If (centrist) rule continued, then I think radical movements would have been stronger in Poland.\u201d \nThe party\u2019s more centrist electorate has stuck with it despite the move to embrace the right, partly because of generous social policies. But any stronger association with the far-right could turn those voters away, analysts say. XENOPHOBIA RISING \nONR and other far-right Polish groups such as Mlodziez Wszechpolska refuse to release membership figures but analysts say acceptance of xenophobic slogans as well as violence against Muslims is on the rise. \nIn a November 2016 survey by CBOS, a pollster overseen by the government, 95 percent of Poles said they did not know anyone from a far-right group. However, more than one in three said they supported far-right activities. \nHate crimes committed against Muslims have grown by more than 300 percent between 2013 and 2016, according to data from the Warsaw University\u2019s Center for Research on Prejudice. \nONR, which calls for \u201cethnic homogeneity\u201d in Poland in its official literature, says it has helped the PiS. \n\u201cPiS has copied some of our rhetoric, for example referring to migrants from Muslim states,\u201d said ONR deputy chief Tomasz Dorosz. \u201cThis has assured their victory in the last election.\u201d \nPoland, like Hungary, has refused to take in any of its European Union quota of refugees from Syria and elsewhere on the grounds that Muslim immigrants are a threat to national security and stability. \nNew PiS Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told the state-run television TVP on Monday that the government\u2019s stance on migrants is not going to change \u201cin years to come\u201d. \n\u201cWe will not accept refugees, migrants from the Middle East and Africa. This is our sovereign decision,\u201d Morawiecki said. \nIn 2016 the PiS government disbanded the Council for the Prevention of Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Intolerancee, an advisory body to the government, and a unit at the interior ministry responsible, among others, for monitoring hate crimes. \n\u201cWhile the PiS governs increasingly as a far-right party, it didn\u2019t campaign as such and it wasn\u2019t elected as such,\u201d said Cas Mudde, an expert on the far-right at the University of Georgia. \nBut with local elections expected in late 2018, a parliamentary vote in 2019 and presidential elections in 2020, this tactic is expected to continue. Polls expect the PiS to do better in the local elections than four years ago. \n\u201cKaczynski is probably disgusted (by the far right),\u201d said Konstanty Gebert, a liberal analyst with the European Council for Foreign Relations think tank. \n\u201cBut it won\u2019t cloud his perspective on election interests.\u201d Additional reporting by Pawel Sobczak, Anna Wlodarczak-Semczuk, Pawel Goraj, Anna Koper in Warsaw, Matt Robinson in Belgrade and Kriszta Than in Budapest; editing by Anna Willard"}

Sixty-two percent of rural voters cast their ballots for Trump, while only 34 percent pulled the lever for Clinton.\nRural voters in such traditionally Democratic \"blue wall\" states as Michigan and Wisconsin were especially instrumental in helping Trump win the election.\nWATCH: Tough times for heartland farmers show chapters Times are tough for farmers in the heartland 4:31 PM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 | 00:54"}

The losses come amid signs of trouble at some of his other golf resorts. His two Scottish resorts, for instance, recently reported losses had doubled in 2016.\nThere are signs of improvement at the Irish property, though. Revenue rose in 2016, and losses are smaller, down 14 percent from a year earlier.\nThe Trump International Golf Links and Hotel in Doonbeg was hurt by a shutdown for 2015 and part of 2016 while the property was being refurbished. A statement by the resort's directors says they expect it to turn an operating profit in 2017. Those results aren't expected until late 2018.\nThe latest losses were first reported by the Irish Times. The newspaper quoted the general manager of the resort saying that revenue jumped an additional 10 percent in the 2017, and that the resort is enjoying \"record green fee business and a steady flow of new members.\"\nIncluding the latest results, the Doonbeg resort has lost about $8.8 million (7.3 million euros) in the three years through 2016. Trump bought the property in 2014.\nTrump has been losing money at his two Scottish resorts for three years, too. In 2016, he posted $23 million in losses. Trump has angered local residents at a resort overlooking the North Sea in Aberdeen with what they claim have been bullying tactics over the years in an effort to expand his property.\nThe Irish course overlooking the Atlantic Ocean is considered one of the Europe's best, but has attracted some controversy, too. Trump last month received approval from a local government to build a wall to protect his course from rising seas. The wall has angered some local residents and environmentalists who say the structure will damage dunes in the area and a public beach.\nSome of Trump's golf courses in the U.S. appear to be facing a backlash from players since he took office. His public courses in Los Angeles and one in the New York have reportedly faced drops in revenue in recent months.\nJust how Trump's other courses have fared as well as his many branded hotels, office towers and residential buildings is unclear because the business is privately held and doesn't release much financial information. Trump stepped down from management of his business when he took office, but retains ownership through a trust managed by his two adult sons."}

Here's how it works: \n\u2014 You are bullish the underlying asset. \n\u2014 Gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock at a set price for a given period of time. \n\u2014 Defines one's risk against potential volatility. \n\"There aren't too many risk assets where you could [see the asset double], and that's what we've been talking about with [cryptocurrencies],\" he said. \"But when you're buying calls, short-dated calls, for instance, into events, you have the potential to do that.\" \nAs an example of a speculative event where a stock could see wild swings, Nathan brings up Bank of America earnings. The big bank is set to report next Wednesday before the bell, and he used the stock to show how buying a call can help investors hedge their bets heading into a volatile event like earnings. \nNathan suggested buying the January 30.5-strike calls for 50 cents. This trade makes money if Bank of America rises above $31 by next Friday's expiration. \nBut the trader also has the potential to make much more than that. \n\"To get a double you need [Bank of America to close at $31.50], that's up about 3.5 percent,\" he said. \"For me, that's taking a speculative view on a short-term event, being long premium and defining your risk.\" \nOn Wednesday, Bank of America rallied more than 1 percent and was trading around $30.70, just 30 cents below the break-even point for Nathan's trade.

U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan must approve the accord. \nThe settlement was smaller than what many analysts anticipated and was seen as a net positive for the scandal-plagued company. Preferred shares ticked up 0.3 percent to 16.60 reais by midday, roughly in line with the country's Bovespa equities index. U.S.-traded shares were unchanged at $10.70. \nAnalysts at Brazilian bank BTG Pactual said the market had expected a settlement of $5 billion to $10 billion. Moody's said in a note that if approved the fine \"would remove the uncertainty related to the amount to be paid to plaintiffs.\" \nThe plaintiffs were upbeat, too. \n\"Simply put, this litigation and its ultimate resolution has yielded an excellent result for the class,\" said Jeremy Lieberman, an attorney for the investors. He called the deal \"historic\" and said it was the largest ever involving a foreign securities issuer. \nInvestors had sued Petrobras after prosecutors in Brazil accused executives of accepting more than $2 billion in bribes over a decade, mainly from construction and engineering companies. \nPetrobras claimed it was itself a victim and denied wrongdoing in a securities filing on Wednesday. But its market value has plunged as its central role in a massive corruption scheme continues to be unwound by investigators. \nFor the past four years, Brazil has been rocked by the so-called \"Car Wash\" investigation, which has exposed billions of dollars in kickbacks to executives of state-run companies and politicians who appointed them to their jobs. \nPetrobras said it hoped the settlement would resolve all investor claims in the United States. \nThe deal does not include investors who bought non U.S.-based Petrobras securities outside the United States, according to the company. \nThe deal came days after Brazil's securities regulator CVM formally accused eight former Petrobras executives of corruption. \nThe accusations relate to possible irregularities in the contracting process for three drilling ships, according to a legal filing by the regulator last Friday. \nAmong the accused in CVM's filing are former Petrobras Chief Executives Officers Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli. Neither could be reached for comment. \nThe largest securities fraud settlements in U.S. history include $7.2 billion stemming from the collapse of Enron, $6.2 billion over an accounting scandal at WorldCom and $3.2 billion over an accounting scandal at Tyco International, according to Stanford Law School's Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.

(NASDAQ:CTRN) today reported unaudited sales for the first two months of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, in advance of its investor presentation at the ICR Conference on January 9, 2018.\nHoliday Sales \u2013 November and December 2017\nTotal sales in the first two months of the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 7.3% to $165.1 million compared with $153.9 million in the same period of 2016. Comparable store sales increased 5.5% in November and 4.5% in December.\nEarnings Forecast for the Fourth Quarter of 2017\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.45 compared with $0.38 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Such guidance for the quarter assumes sales of approximately $211 million, cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation) of approximately $131 million and selling, general, administrative and depreciation expenses of approximately $72 million. As disclosed previously, this year\u2019s fourth quarter includes a 14 th week that is expected to be break-even from a profit standpoint and also includes an expected increase in incentive compensation and insurance expense from last year\u2019s fourth quarter totaling $1.7 million, which is expected to have a negative effect of approximately $0.09 on this year\u2019s fourth quarter diluted earnings per share in relation to the fourth quarter of last year.\nThe Company is still evaluating the impact of the recent enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) on its 2017 financial statements, and the guidance does not reflect a one-time, non-cash charge that is expected to be required in the fourth quarter as a result of the Act. While the Company expects its financial results and cash flows to benefit in future years from the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate pursuant to the Act, the Company anticipates that it will record a charge to decrease the value of its deferred tax assets from the previous 35% federal tax rate to the new 21% rate in the fourth quarter.\nBruce Smith, Acting Chief Executive Officer, commented, \u201cWe were very pleased with a 4.8% comparable store sales increase in the first two months of the quarter, which was on top of a 2.9% increase during the same period the previous year. All five of our major merchandise categories continued to contribute to the growth in comparable store sales.\nAs a result of the strong execution by the Citi Trends\u2019 team, we are well positioned to complete our fifth consecutive quarter of comparable store sales increases, which we believe is an indication that our strategic efforts to drive sales in both apparel and non-apparel categories are working. Importantly, we believe these strong sales results have led to high-quality inventory levels as we begin to prepare for the spring selling season.\nFiscal 2017 has been an extremely good year thus far for Citi Trends, as we have built sales momentum, significantly improved earnings and returned $25 million to our stockholders in the form of a share repurchase program. As we move forward, we are very positive about Citi Trends\u2019 future. We believe that continued comparable store sales increases and store unit growth, leading to increased profitability and cash flows, are reasonable expectations for our Company. Importantly, the realization of those goals would allow us to continue to return capital to our stockholders as part of our expanded capital return program announced earlier in 2017.

Steinhoff said the timeline for the completion of the investigation remained uncertain.\nThe company had reported a 1.4 billion euros ($1.69 billion) net profit in 2016 while its 2015 accounts showed earnings of 959 million euros, according to Steinhoff\u2019s annual reports.\n\u201cThe latest information confirms what we\u2019ve suspected all along (about the reliability of the results for 2015 and beyond),\u201d one hedge fund manager said, declining to be named. \u201cWhat we\u2019re eagerly waiting for is the outcome of the PwC investigation.\u201d\nThe accounting scandal marks a fall from grace for the retailer which has grown rapidly via an international M&A spree that began in 2011 with the acquisition of Conforama, Europe\u2019s second biggest furniture retailer.\nIt has also tainted the reputation of Steinhoff\u2019s chairman and biggest shareholder Christo Wiese, considered one of South Africa\u2019s most respected stewards of shareholder capital.\nShares in Steinhoff, once dubbed Africa\u2019s IKEA, have fallen around 90 percent since news of the accounting irregularities broke in early December, wiping 185 billion rand ($14.99 billion) off its market value.\nIt warned then that there was a 2 billion euro ($2.4 billion) hole in its balance sheet and has since said that some credit facilities have been suspended or withdrawn as it grapples with more than 10 billion euros in outstanding debt.\nSeparately, the company has been under investigation for suspected accounting fraud in Germany since 2015.

It added that proceeds will go towards investments in growth such as buying into foreign information technology companies. \n\u201cIt makes sense to spin off the mobile-phone business using a public offering that would leave SoftBank in control and provide SoftBank with more cash to pursue its strategy of investing in companies with potentially high growth prospects,\u201d Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business. \n\u201cIt is a way of obtaining capital without adding debt or diluting SoftBank\u2018s equity interests in the growth companies.\u201d \nSoftBank Group plans to seek approval from the Tokyo Stock Exchange as early as spring, the Nikkei said, adding that it was aiming to list around autumn in Tokyo as well as overseas, possibly London. \nThe conglomerate said in a statement that a listing of the telecoms business was one option for its capital strategy but that no such decision had been made. Its shares finished 3% higher on the news. \nAn IPO of about 2 trillion yen would be one of the biggest offerings by a Japanese company, rivaling a 2.1 trillion yen listing by NTT DoCoMo Inc in 1998 and the 2.2 trillion yen raised by the government\u2019s sale of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp shares before its 1987 listing. \nLarge companies seeking to list in Tokyo are required to float at least 35% of their shares although these rules can be eased when the company is also listing overseas. \nCOMPLEX STRUCTURE \nSoftBank Group has a vast range of holdings including stakes in British chip designer ARM Holdings, struggling U.S. wireless service provider Sprint Corp as well as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. \nIt has with other investors also set up a $93 billion Vision Fund that is investing in a range of firms to capitalize on a tech future expected to be driven by artificial intelligence, robotics and interconnected devices. \nThat complicated structure and constant stream of new investments has made valuing the company extremely difficult and analysts often note that its market value does not accurately reflect the value of its massive holdings. \nSoftBank Group\u2019s market capitalisation currently stands at around $92 billion. By contrast, its near 30% stake in Alibaba is worth around $140 billion. \nAn IPO could lead to softness in SoftBank Group shares for a while as some telecoms-focused investors sell their holdings to buy shares in the newly listed entity, said Chris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. \n\u201cWhat SoftBank will ultimately have to do, and they would have to do this in any case, is attract investors who are looking at this as a tech focused investment co(mpany),\u201d he said. \nThe domestic telecoms unit posted a 4.5% rise in operating profit to 720 billion yen in the year ended March on sales of 3.2 trillion yen. \nWhile it has been SoftBank Group\u2019s most profitable source of income, it faces headwinds including an aging population, a shift by consumers to cheaper carriers and plans by e-commerce firm Rakuten Inc to enter the market. \nWith SoftBank\u2018s founder Masayoshi Son reluctant to sell stakes in investments seen as having large upside potential such as Alibaba, listing the telecoms business could provide a place to park some of the conglomerate\u2019s large debt burden. \n\u201cIf the desire is to be able to raise capital for future vision funds, pushing as much of the debt into the telco as possible makes sense,\u201d said Lane. \nSoftBank\u2018s debt pile stood at around $100 billion in the financial quarter ended September.

The memo effectively handed control of marijuana enforcement and regulation to the states, except in certain circumstances.\nSessions' decision sent pot stocks tumbling Thursday , fueling fears it would damage burgeoning marijuana industries in many states.\n\"We've already had conversations with our attorney general, as well as our acting U.S. attorney, who clearly have said they're not going to change anything with regards to the industry here in Colorado,\" Hanckock said.\nColorado, where recreational cannabis has been legal since 2012 and medical for much longer , has a lot more to lose than some states. In 2016, the state topped $1 billion in legal weed revenues , allowing the government to bring in more than $193 million in fees and tax revenues, according to Department of Revenue data.\nHancock said Denver reaps about $18 million to $20 million in tax revenue just from recreational marijuana. That money goes toward implementing marijuana regulation, including inspections, law enforcement and public education, all of which Hancock worries might disappear following Sessions' decision.\n\"Cities also fall into this uncertain category, when you have the attorney general acting as irresponsible as he has acted with regards to the memo,\" Hancock said.\nInvestment and taxes aside, the ground-level industry is very cash heavy. Even with the Cole Memo, banks and credit unions operating under federal charters had little incentive to help cannabis businesses, which are still federally illegal, according to a representative from the Colorado Bankers Association. \n\"W hat we would hope our attorney general would do to work with Congress, begin the process of working on a pathway to banking for this industry,\" Hancock said.\nHancock is part of a growing chorus of prominent voices against Sessions' decision. On Thursday, Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner vowed to hold up Justice Department nominations until Sessions changes his marijuana policy ."}

{"published":"2018-01-03T11:12:00.000+02:00","title":"The US can benefit from fair and reciprocal trade in a growing world economy - commentary","text":"While the American political analysts keep looking for the \"Trump doctrine\" of global relations in terms of military confrontations, their Chinese , French and German colleagues are focusing on economic and financial aspects of the policy slogans \"America First\" and \"Make America Great Again.\"\nTo understand that, recall that President Donald Trump did not make many waves abroad with military threats, but he did raise existential issues by announcing a review of trade policies that got America stuck with annual deficits of $700 billion to $800 billion.\nThat's what got Germans fizzing with fury. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel insisted on coming to Washington in February 2017 for clarifications from Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson while they were still moving into their new offices. Berlin then followed that up in mid-March with a meeting in Washington that looked like an inter-governmental economic seminar with the new administration, chaired by Trump and Chancellor Angela Merkel .\nWorried about their $164 billion of bilateral trade with the U.S., the Germans were moving fast in trying to protect their export business that accounts for nearly one-half of the economy.\nLet Trump talk dollars and sense The Chinese were not far behind. President Xi Jinping came to Florida in early April to meet Trump and convince him that a \"win-win cooperation\" was much better than intractable frictions in dealing with decades of Washington's neglect while the Chinese were pocketing trillions of dollars from U.S. trade transactions.\nChina's $580 billion of annual trade with the U.S. is an essential feature of Beijing's economic policy as the country rushes to modernize, eradicate poverty and build a \"moderately prosperous society\" over the next two years. That trade is a vector of investment flows and technology transfers that China needs to upgrade the quality of its economic development.\nJobs, incomes and a real wealth creation is what the Europeans and Chinese are fretting about \u2014 a sharp contrast to American global strategists who give the economy short shrift, ignore the wellsprings of American power and argue instead about whom to hit next.\nLuckily, the Europeans and the Chinese will continue to focus on sustained economic growth. That should help America to sell them more goods and services to reinvigorate the economy and overcome structural obstacles to a faster potential and noninflationary growth.\nGermany is a good example of such an opportunity. At the moment, the country is experiencing brisk economic activity, full employment and widespread labor shortages. By insisting on a more balanced trade relationship, the U.S. now has a chance to step up export sales to a thriving German economy.\nGermans are also working on new business possibilities. Echoing similar voices in other European countries, members of Germany's possibly new governing coalition are forcefully advocating friendlier U.S.-Russian ties to get rid of sanction wars and reopen access to commerce and investments the Europeans are currently losing to their Asian competitors.\nWith about $80 billion of U.S. trade, France is a much smaller economic partner, but its economy is perking up and offering more lively markets for American products. Paris will also play an important role in future trans-Atlantic economic relations once Germany gets its government and further European Union integration initiatives become top policy issues.\nEuropeans want a trade axis with China For the U.S., China will remain a structurally difficult trade problem in the years ahead \u2014 even though some unexpectedly fast progress is being made. For example, in the first 10 months of 2017, American exports to China grew at an annual rate of 13 percent. That is a big turnaround from a 3.5 percent decline during the same period of 2016.\nUnfortunately, political tensions are a serious obstacle to a more balanced bilateral trade. The Chinese view with suspicion and disappointment Washington's refusal to accept Beijing's concepts of \"big power diplomacy\" and \"win-win cooperation.\" The U.S. continues to consider China as a \"strategic competitor,\" and it recently also declined to agree to China's WTO status as a market economy \u2014 a big setback for China because that status would have shielded Chinese exports from an avalanche of anti-dumping investigations and lawsuits.\nChina looks like it is taking all that in stride. Beijing has stepped up efforts to diversify China's global trade business, with particular emphasis on East Asia, Belt and Road projects and the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union, Middle East, Balkans and East Europe, including Ukraine.\nThe EU will also help China with its proposed new \"trade axis linking the EU and China via Russia.\" The French President Emmanuel Macron will be pushing that idea next week during his state visit to Beijing.\nAll that, however, is hardly an alternative to China's estimated $520 billion worth of export sales to the U.S. in the course of 2017. Washington, therefore, retains an enormous trade leverage. But it will be a hard slog to reach a fourfold increase of current monthly exports to China to meaningfully narrow annual trade deficits of $350 billion to $400 billion.\nTrump may wish to think again about linking the China trade with Beijing's efforts to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons and their delivery vehicles. But the president is perfectly justified in his determination to use the principle of fair and reciprocal trade to wind down America's massive wealth and technology transfers through manifestly excessive trade imbalances.\nInvestment thoughts An accelerating increase of American domestic demand (private and government spending plus all segments of investment outlays) will trigger rising imports of foreign goods and services, a widening trade deficit and a drag on GDP growth.\nThat can be offset to a certain extent by ensuring that increasing volumes of American products are sold overseas in accordance with the rule of fair and reciprocal trade to avoid the past experience of systematic and excessive trade deficits with Europe and China. That task would be relatively easier now in an environment of a steadily growing world economy.\nThose running for office in mid-term Congressional elections next November would do well to remember that trade deficits and inflation affect real incomes, asset values, economic activity and the mood on Main Street and Wall Street. That's more important and easier to understand than the sequels to the likely Korean meeting in Panmunjom next week.\nFighting to sell American products abroad, and to hold inflation where it is now, would make it possible for the Fed to support the economy and the real value of dollar-denominated savings instruments.\nCommentary by Michael Ivanovitch, an independent analyst focusing on world economy, geopolitics and investment strategy.

Instead of that debacle bringing both sides closer to an immigration deal, they are now further apart than ever.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer made that clear Tuesday when he said the Democrats are reversing their previous compromise decision to support up to $25 billion for President Donald Trump 's border wall and security enhancements. President Trump quickly countered with:\nTrump tweet\nNow it appears both sides are running to the comfort of their more extreme corner.\nIt seems like a long time ago that Trump was promising that the adult children of illegal immigrants, or \"Dreamers,\" had nothing to worry about and the same Trump was saying that he'd \"take the heat\" for accepting the immigration compromises made by bipartisan congressional leaders.\nSo, what changed?\nThe answer depends on whom you ask.\nDemocrats say things changed when Trump backed away from those conciliatory words about the Dreamers when he rejected the so-called Gang of Six's compromise deal.\nThe White House says that rejection happened because that deal was worse than anything Trump imagined when he made those comments because it \"would not secure our border, encouraged more illegal immigration, increased chain migration, and retained the visa lottery system.\"\nSo what will it take for both sides to strike a deal?\nThe answer to that one is easier: Keep it simple, stupid.\nThe DACA deal has been elusive in part because the Democrats have tried to use the popularity of the Dreamers as a chip to advance their broader immigration agenda.\nSupport is so strong for the plight of the Dreamers in most polls , that you can see why opportunistic Democrats with loftier goals would try to use them as leverage to achieve them.\nThe satirical Onion website best captured the reality of the Democrats' intentions regarding the Dreamers with this comedic headline:\n\" Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren Assure Dreamers They'll Never Stop Fighting For The 2020 Nomination \"\nBut support for the Dreamers isn't invulnerable. The polls also show that voters don't think their fight is worth a government shutdown. The Democrats overplayed their hand.\nTrump risks doing the same thing. Dreamers are now angrily protesting the Democrats' failure to secure their immigration status, with one protest even showing up at Schumer's private home.\nBut if Trump tries to use that pressure to squeeze more than the previously agreed-to funding for his border wall and security, he too would be overreaching.\nThat brings us back to the simplicity solution.\nSen. John Thune, a member of the GOP Senate leadership, is one of the more important voices asking both sides to simply keep the deal to the Dreamers and a reasonable funding amount for the wall and border security. \"Narrower gets it done,\" according to Thune \u2013 and he's right.\nThis wisdom should enter the heads of people like Schumer and the president before the Feb. 8 deadline for a DACA vote. Dreamers and their advocates need to pressure Schumer to stop using them to grab more than just securing their legal status.\nAnd Schumer needs to convince them that getting a path to full citizenship is worth waiting for in return for not worrying about losing their jobs and college scholarships or getting deported.\nMeanwhile, the White House needs to convince immigration hardliners that getting money for border security and the wall is good enough for now. A plan to curb existing chain migration and ending the visa lottery can wait until the Dreamers' issues are settled because the threat of their popularity makes it too hard to win those battles now.\nThe deal that can and should work now is simple: Dreamers get amnesty and Trump gets $25 billion for the wall. Have a nice day.\nA wider immigration battle can take place later once the budget is passed and shutdowns and the plight of the sympathetic Dreamers are no longer looming over everything.\nThe clear lesson of the last week is that shutdowns don't work, political greed is counterproductive, and you can't serve your supporters by using them for political blackmail. Anyone can see this now, except perhaps Chuck Schumer and some of the staunchest anti-illegal immigration hardliners.\nThey now have about two weeks to get a grip on reality.\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

Rohingya Muslims wait to cross the border to Bangladesh, in a temporary camp outside Maungdaw, northern Rakhine state, Myanmar November 12, 2017. Picture taken on November 12, 2017. REUTERS\/Wa Lone\/Files \nSurakiart Sathirathai, a former Thai foreign minister, also expressed concern at the arrest of two Reuters reporters in Myanmar last month and said he hoped the case did not lead to broader restrictions on the international media. \n\u201cI think press and humanitarian access to Rakhine are important issues as well as free access to other stakeholders,\u201d said Surakiart in an interview in Bangkok. \u201cLegitimate press coverage is something that should be enhanced.\u201d \nMyanmar has severely curtailed access to Rakhine, where an army operation in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents has been condemned by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing - an accusation rejected by the Buddhist majority country. \nSurakiart, 59, was chosen last year by Myanmar\u2019s leader Aung San Suu Kyi to head a 10-member board that will advise on how to implement the recommendations of an earlier commission headed by former U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan. \nAllowing free media coverage was one of the specific recommendations in the 63-page report from Annan\u2019s commission, which was appointed by Suu Kyi in 2016 to investigate how to solve Rakhine\u2019s long-standing ethnic and religious tensions. \nReuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who had worked on coverage of the crisis in the western state, were arrested in Yangon on Dec. 12 on suspicion of violating Myanmar\u2019s Official Secrets Act. \nSurakiart said he had raised concerns about their case with Suu Kyi\u2019s national security advisor Thaung Tun. He said he had asked for the case to be dealt with transparently and been assured that proper legal procedures would be followed. \n\u201cI hope that this would not snowball in adverse directions for both the international press and the Myanmar government,\u201d Surakiart added. \u201cI hope the case will not lead to the Myanmar government not welcoming the international press. I want this to be a specific case and hope for a quick resolution to it.\u201d BRIDGING THE GAP \nThe Annan-led panel delivered its recommendations - which also included a review of a law that links citizenship and ethnicity and leaves most Rohingya stateless - just before insurgent attacks on security posts on Aug. 25 triggered the latest crisis. \nSurakiart said there were concerns over the repatriation of those who had since fled to Bangladesh and that the advisory board would need to find an approach to ensure people could return without fear, even if they were not recognised by existing law as Myanmar citizens. \nSuu Kyi has faced international criticism for perceived inaction over the crisis in Rakhine, but Surakiart said she was constrained by domestic politics. \nBuddhist nationalism has surged in Myanmar in recent years, and the army campaign has wide support. \n\u201cAung San Suu Kyi tried to address the issue by trying to build consensus from within rather than finger-pointing,\u201d said Surakiart. \n\u201cThere is a big gap between domestic and international interpretations of the situation in Rakhine. If we can\u2019t bridge this gap then it will be an obstacle for all of us who want to improve the situation.\u201d \nThe former Thai foreign minister also said his advisory board would seek to engage with all groups in Rakhine, including the military. \n\u201cThe advisory board is not a mouthpiece to anyone,\u201d Surakiart said. \u201cWe are not a spokesperson for Myanmar or the international community.\u201d \nThe board, which is made up of five members from Myanmar and five international appointees including veteran former U.S. politician and diplomat Bill Richardson, will meet the Myanmar government on Jan. 22 in the capital Naypyitaw before making its first trip to Rakhine on Jan. 24. \n\u201cI do not want the advisory board to be just a talking shop,\u201d Surakiart said. \u201cWe want to help bring about tangible progress.\u201d Additional report by Chayut Setboonsarng; Editing by Matthew Tostevin and Alex Richardson"}

About 500 law enforcement officers and firefighters were combing mud-covered neighborhoods, using dogs, helicopters and thermal imaging equipment to locate missing people.\n\u201cWe are still very much in active search and rescue mode,\u201d Elms said in a phone interview. The current death toll of 15 confirmed fatalities could rise, he warned.\n\u201dThat\u2019s a fear, Elms said. \u201cWe are still very hopeful that we will locate people alive.\u201d\nOfficials have ordered residents in a large swath of Montecito to stay in their homes so that rescuers can better go about their work.\nAbout 300 people were stranded in a canyon. Local rescue crews, using borrowed helicopters from the U.S. Coast Guard, worked to airlift them out, officials said.\nThe county initially ordered 7,000 residents to evacuate and urged another 23,000 to do so voluntarily, but only 10 to 15 percent complied with mandatory orders, said Amber Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Santa Barbara County Fire Department.\nThe slides closed several historic hotels, including The Four Seasons Biltmore, which had just reopened on Monday after repairing damage from the wildfires. The courtyard of the 90-year-old Montecito Inn, built by silent movie actor Charlie Chaplin, was filled with a thick crust of debris driven by the slides.\nFILE PHOTO: An aerial view from a Ventura County Sheriff helicopter shows a site damaged by mudslide in Montecito, California, U.S. January 9, 2018.

The fires burned away grass and shrubs that held the soil in place and also baked a waxy layer into the earth that prevents water from sinking deeply into the ground.\nAdditional reporting by Peter Szekely in New York, Rich McKay in Atlanta and Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Chris Reese\n "}

He just goes out there and looks from ball one that he\u2019s been batting for three hours already,\u201d Cummins told reporters. \n\u201dNo obvious weakness, no obvious time that it takes him to build into his innings. From ball one he knows his game so well. \n\u201dThose big innings he has played as well, they have been really important. In Brisbane and Perth they were match-winning and in Melbourne it was match-saving. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just incredible and I think he\u2019s been the difference between the two sides.\u201d \nSmith\u2019s extraordinary form has solidified his position as the world\u2019s top-ranked batsman and only Donald Bradman reached the 6,000-run milestone in fewer innings - West Indies great Garfield Sobers taking the same number. \nAs a team mate of Smith\u2019s at New South Wales, Cummins rarely bowls against him in match conditions but his experiences in the nets have given him enough of an inkling of how difficult it is. \u201cHe\u2019s very different to pretty much every other batsman,\u201d the paceman said. \n\u201dHe moves so much it\u2019s harder to find your target. A normal fourth stump ball to anyone else, he can hit to the leg side as though it\u2019s a leg stump ball and then the next ball he might not move so far and he hits a full-blooded cover drive. \n\u201dI think he\u2019s just a really hard batsman to get a rhythm to. I think the best batsmen in the world are the most proactive, that find a way to get off strike, find a way not to let you settle in as a bowler. \n\u201cHe\u2019s a seriously smart batsman, he knows what he\u2019s doing and he knows how to have one over the bowler.\u201d (Editing by Sudipto Ganguly)"}

That's only partly true. \nAt public, four-year institutions, costs for the 2017-18 school year hit $20,770, according to the College Board . Tuition plus room and board at four-year private universities was much higher: $47,000, on average, in the current academic year. \nHowever, about two-thirds of all full-time students receive aid, which can bring the sticker price significantly down. Your net price is a college's tuition and fees minus grants, scholarships and education tax benefits, according to the College Board. \nTo that end, The Princeton Review ranked colleges by how much financial aid is awarded and how satisfied students are with their packages. The report is based on data collected from fall 2016 through summer 2017. \nThe schools that fared the best were all private schools, many of which have sky-high prices, but very generous aid packages. show chapters 10:36 AM ET Fri, 31 March 2017 | 01:10 \n\"We look at sticker price but also academics and financial aid. And that's really where the value comes in,\" said Robert Franek, The Princeton Review's editor-in-chief and author of \"Colleges That Pay You Back.\" \nWhen it comes to offering aid , private schools typically have more money to spend, he added. \"These schools have been very clear about their commitment to making college costs affordable and giving out massive amounts of aid to students and families that need it.\" \nHere are the schools that made The Princeton Review's top 10: 10. Colgate University Colgate University, with Taylor Lake in the foreground, is shown in Hamilton, N.Y. \nLocation: Hamilton, N.Y. Tuition, fees, room and board: $67,500 Average need-based scholarship: $45,724 Out-of-pocket cost: $21,776 \nStudents here have a healthy dose of school spirit, with good reason: Colgate is one of the best liberal arts schools in the country even though it has very high tuition. Still, students receive over $45,000 in grant aid, on average, making it a much more affordable place to matriculate. 9. Yale University Craig Warga | Bloomberg | Getty Images The Sterling Memorial Library on the Yale University campus in New Haven, Connecticut. \nLocation: New Haven, Conn. Tuition, fees, room and board: $66,900 Average need-based scholarship: $47,960 Out-of-pocket cost: $18,940 \nThis Ivy puts its money where its mouth is: Committed to meeting 100 percent of each applicant's demonstrated need, Yale spends more than $100 million on student financial aid each year. As a result, more than 10 percent of the student body will have $0 expected parent contribution in 2018. 8. Vassar College \nTuition, fees, room and board: $68,060 Average need-based scholarship: $45,109 Out-of-pocket cost: $22,951 \nVassar is one of most expensive colleges in the country but also one of the most generous. The average scholarship is just over $45,000, making the total cost less than $23,000 for a top liberal arts school with a stunning campus. 7. Princeton University Students walking to classes at Princeton University, Princeton, NJ \nLocation: Princeton, N.J. Tuition, fees, room and board: $60,090 Average need-based scholarship: $47,497 Out-of-pocket cost: $12,593 \nThis elite Ivy League school makes the top of many college lists, but it's also highly regarded for its war on student debt. Princeton has eliminated all loans for students who qualify for aid. Instead, awards come in the form of grants that do not need to be repaid. 6. Pomona College Ted Soqui | Corbis | Getty Images Pomona College \nTuition, fees, room and board: $67,225 Average need-based scholarship: $41,443 Out-of-pocket cost: $25,782 \nAs a member of the Claremont Colleges, a group of highly regarded schools just outside of Los Angeles, admission to Pomona is tough but also need-blind. The goal is to achieve \"significant socio-economic diversity,\" according to Adam Sapp, Pomona's senior associate dean and director of admissions. 5. Washington University in St. Louis Stephen Ehlers | Getty Images \nTuition, fees, room and board: $67,539 Average need-based scholarship: $40,509 Out-of-pocket cost: $27,030 \nAt first glance, Wash U. is another one of the pricier schools on Princeton Review's list but it is similarly committed to helping defray the cost without relying on loan debt. For starters, all aid to families earning $75,000 or less a year is grant-based, which means it does not have to be paid pack. 4.

Tuition, fees, room and board: $61,370 Average need-based scholarship: $15,394* Out-of-pocket cost: $45,976 \nIn the heart of New York City is a small school making a big promise to provide an affordable education. Aside from the aid available to help cover housing, food, books and supplies at Cooper Union, all students receive a half-tuition scholarship worth over $20,000 a year*. 3. Vanderbilt University Vanderbilt | Collegiate Images | Getty Images General view of the Benson Science Hall on the campus of the Vanderbilt Commodores in Nashville, Tennessee. \nLocation: Nashville, Tenn.

And they are renewable for all four years of college. 2. Williams College Chapin Hall at Williams College \nLocation: Williamstown, Mass. Tuition, fees, room and board: $67,700 Average need-based scholarship: $48,885 Out-of-pocket cost: $18,815 \nOne of the nation's very best schools also gets extremely high marks for its ability to finance its students' educations. The school meets 100 percent of demonstrated need for all undergrads for all four years. 1.

Some PPP projects, however, are used by local governments to borrow money. \nThe CIRC said on Friday the new rules are aimed at preventing insurers from turning private equity investment into lending, which raises financing costs in the real economy. \nThe regulator also said schemes should not be used to increase local governments\u2019 liabilities.

(NASDAQ: SCYX), a biotechnology company delivering innovative anti-infective therapies for difficult-to-treat and often life-threatening infections, today provided a corporate update, including recent pipeline developments and anticipated milestones in 2018, for its lead antifungal candidate, SCY-078. SCY-078 is the first representative of a novel oral and intravenous (IV) triterpenoid antifungal family in clinical and pre-clinical development for the treatment of several serious fungal infections, including invasive candidiasis, invasive aspergillosis, refractory invasive fungal infections and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC).\n\"In 2017, we made significant progress in advancing the clinical development of SCY-078 in indications addressable and approvable with an orally-administered antifungal therapy,\" said Marco Taglietti, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of SCYNEXIS. \"In addition, we advanced the IV program of SCY-078 to address the clinical hold placed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following thrombotic events observed in a Phase 1 study. We plan to restart clinical trials with IV SCY-078 in the third quarter of 2018, using a liposomal IV formulation that has shown an improved tolerability profile in pre-clinical assessments compared with the cyclodextrin-based IV formulation used in the earlier study.\"\nDr. Taglietti continued: \"We are excited about our strategic plans for 2018, when we envision SCY-078 advancing in multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials to maximize the broad potential clinical utility of SCY-078 in addressing unmet medical needs in VVC, invasive candidiasis, invasive aspergillosis and refractory invasive fungal infections.\"\nPath Forward Established for IV Program of SCY-078, with Clinical Trials to Initiate in the Third Quarter of 2018 with an Improved IV Formulation\nAs previously disclosed in March 2017, the FDA required SCYNEXIS to hold the initiation of any new clinical studies of the IV formulation of SCY-078 following the review of three mild-to-moderate inflammation-related thrombotic events in healthy volunteers receiving the IV formulation at the highest dose level in a Phase 1 study. That study used a cyclodextrin-based IV formulation.\nBroad Pre-clinical Program Executed to Address the Clinical Hold. Based on subsequent interactions with the FDA, SCYNEXIS completed a broad range of pre-clinical activities designed to identify the underlying cause of the thrombotic events and to evaluate the optimal administration regimen for the cyclodextrin-based IV formulation of SCY-078. In parallel, SCYNEXIS continued its pursuit of alternative IV formulations. No Intrinsic Pro-Coagulant Effect of the SCY-078 Compound. Several pre-clinical studies showed that SCY-078 does not affect blood coagulation by itself, providing supporting evidence that the thrombotic events associated with the administration of the cyclodextrin-based IV formulation were triggered by vascular endothelium inflammation at the site of infusion. Accelerated Development of a Liposomal IV Formulation of SCY-078. During 2017, SCYNEXIS accelerated the development of a new formulation based on liposomal technology. This technology has been successfully used to improve systemic tolerability of other commercially available IV formulations. Favorable Profile of the Liposomal IV Formulation of SCY-078. SCYNEXIS compared the cyclodextrin-based IV formulation head-to-head against the liposomal IV formulation of SCY-078 in pre-clinical evaluations, and the liposomal formulation showed a superior profile for infusion-related tolerability and vascular inflammation. Pre-clinical Activities Ongoing to Enable Planned Human Studies of the Liposomal IV Formulation of SCY-078. Based on these initial pre-clinical studies, SCYNEXIS believes that the liposomal IV formulation may offer significant clinical benefits over the cyclodextrin-based IV formulation and, therefore, decided to focus its efforts on the advancement of the liposomal IV formulation of SCY-078. This decision was discussed with the FDA and a path forward was established. Additional pre-clinical studies are ongoing, and SCYNEXIS intends to initiate a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers in the third quarter of 2018, pending FDA's review. Phase 2b Study in Invasive Candidiasis. Upon successful completion of the Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, SCYNEXIS plans to initiate a Phase 2b study of SCY-078 in invasive candidiasis with the liposomal IV formulation in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nClinical Development of Oral Formulation of SCY-078 Continues to Progress as Planned in Multiple Indications Approvable with an Oral Agent\nSCYNEXIS is pursuing several programs where the oral formulation of SCY-078 has the potential to be a suitable treatment for indications with significant unmet medical needs and considerable commercial potential.\nV VC \u2013 Most Advanced Stage of Clinical Development, Targeting Both Acute and Recurrent Infections. Rapid Recruitment in the Phase 2 Dose-finding DOVE Study. In August 2017, SCYNEXIS initiated dosing in the Phase 2 study, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the oral formulation of SCY-078 vs. oral fluconazole, the standard of care, for the treatment of VVC. Robust enrollment in the trial has been maintained, and SCYNEXIS continues to expect top-line results in mid-2018. In a previously conducted, proof-of-concept, Phase 2a study in VVC patients, SCY-078 showed high clinical cure and low recurrence rates. Initiation of Phase 3 Program Planned for the Fourth Quarter of 2018. SCYNEXIS anticipates that the dose regimen selected from the DOVE study will be subsequently evaluated in Phase 3 studies following an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. SCYNEXIS expects to initiate the Phase 3 clinical program in the fourth quarter of 2018. Refractory Invasive Fungal Infections \u2013 Potential for Streamlined Development Pathway. Enrollment Ongoing in the FURI Study for the Treatment of Patients with a Wide Range of Candida spp. Infections with Limited or No Treatment Options. Sixteen sites in the U.S and Europe are now active in this open-label study, and enrollment is progressing as planned. CARES Study Opened for Enrollment for the Treatment of Patients with Candida auris Infections. Systemic infections caused by C. auris, a pathogen that is often multidrug-resistant, are associated with high mortality. The CARES study is designed to provide rapid access to oral SCY-078 for patients with this life-threatening and difficult-to-treat infection. This emergency protocol allows for expeditious site initiation upon request from investigators. Both FURI and CARES Studies Designed as Pivotal Trials to Support a Potential Approval. The open-label design of these studies allows for evaluation of the data on an interim basis to further inform subsequent regulatory steps of the development program.

Here\u2019s how we get there 5:46 PM ET Thu, 4 Jan 2018 | 02:56 The market barely had a chance to catch its breath this week, with the Dow hitting a new milestone of 25,000 and other indices setting new highs.\nHowever, chatter on Wall Street (and in the White House) has quickly turned to the next target. \"I guess our new number is 30,000,\" President Donald Trump told reporters on Thursday, after lauding the blue-chip index's run-up to its 25,000 level.\nAt least one Wall Street analyst thinks the president could be proven correct sooner that some think.\nChris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, is also expecting the Dow to set its next significant round-numbered milestone, perhaps this year.\n\"I think we can get there [but] it's not going to be a straight line,\" Zaccarelli told CNBC's \" Trading Nation \" this week.\n\"There's going to be plenty of pullbacks along the way, but I think in the next year or two you could see that big run-up that we've all been waiting for, as investors start to feel a little bit more enthusiastic about this rally,\" he added.\nCurrently at roughly 105 months in length, this bull market is the second longest in history, behind the 113-month stretch from 1990 to 2000. While criticisms abound over how stretched valuations remain in this bull market, Zaccarelli said equities still have some room to run before reaching the peak seen during 1990-2000.\n\"Looking forward, it may be 18 to 18.5 forward earnings for this year on the S&P 500 ,\" he said.\n\"If you look at the previous bull market that we're looking to eclipse, the one that happened in the 1990s, the PE [price\/earnings] ratio at that point got into the mid-20s, so I think we have a long way to go from here in terms of valuation if this rally really has legs,\" the investor added.\nRecent markets highs owe their records to the staggering run-up over the past 12 months. It took the Dow just 35 calendar days after breaking 24,000 before it breached 25,000. The move from 20,000 to 25,000 took the Dow just under 12 months.\nThat was last year, though. Most investors do not expect the degree of strength that fueled gains in 2017 to repeat this year.\n\"I think it would be quite a stretch for us to get there by the end of the year, although it's not impossible,\" added Zaccarelli.\nFor the Dow to reach 30,000 by the end of the year, it would need to add another 19 percent from current levels. Instead, Zaccarelli expects the index to hit that marker in 2019.\nEven so, this bull market could still have the capacity to surprise.\n\"Frankly, last year was surprisingly strong. This year might surprise many of us, as well,\" added Zaccarelli.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding."}

As former Trump advisor Steve Bannon was being pushed out of his perch at Breitbart News following backlash over comments he made to journalist Michael Wolff about the president and his family, the White House announced that Trump would be going to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland \u2013 an event widely seen as the annual retreat of the globalist financial elite.\nWhat's more, the president invited cameras in to record nearly an hour of his negotiations with Democrats and Republicans on DACA , suggesting to them he was open to a comprehensive deal on immigration reform.\nAs for the wall Trump campaigned on, aides suggested quietly that it doesn't need to be all that long; just so there's enough built that the president can credibly say he kept his campaign promise.\n\"He was always more moderate than he was given credit for,\" an administration official told me Tuesday. \"On almost everything, with few exceptions, he is willing to deal.\"\n\"The main thing about the wall is you don't have to have a wall for all three thousand miles. You can have sections. It doesn't take that much.\"\nAll of that comes at a time when the president is being increasingly embraced by members of the the Republican establishment \u2014 even Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker , who once publicly doubted Trump's stability and competence, stood smiling behind the president Monday in Tennessee as he signed an order on rural broadband access, happily accepting the president's pen as a keepsake.\nThe moment certainly seems ripe for Trump to capture more legislative momentum.\nBut, once again, the details could get in the president's way. Look at the two legislative items the president has said he wants to push this year: Welfare reform and infrastructure.\nQuestions about infrastructure plans On infrastructure, the president's biggest problem will be House conservatives. The White House has already held conversations with the conservative Republican Study Committee and Freedom Caucus to persuade conservatives to support infrastructure spending that they might otherwise see as Obama-style government stimulus spending.\nPart of the pitch will be developing ways to say the infrastructure spending pays for itself, including by streamlining requirements for construction projects, and developing a dynamic score for the final package that takes into account expected economic growth.\nBut there's a lot still to be determined, including what the technical details will be, how much detail the White House wants to release, and how much the Trump team wants to leave up to the congressional committees to fill in the blanks.\nshow chapters Barney Frank: Tradeoff for tax cuts is there's no money left for infrastructure 9:21 AM ET Fri, 5 Jan 2018 | 02:56 \"I don't get the sense that we have had the kinds of serious conversations that it would take,\" said an administration official. \"The president's inclination is just 'spend money,' while the House is more talking about public private partnerships.\"\n\"The president's view of it is a Manhattan-centric vision of giant bridges and tunnels that people remember. If Donald Trump is building something, he wants it to be huge.\"\nA senior GOP Capitol Hill aide agreed that the plan under consideration and the president's plan might be at odds. \"There's an outline of a plan that (White House economic advisor) Gary Cohn has put forward. I'm not sure if Trump is completely on board with that,\" the aide said.\n\"I think the onus is on the administration and the White House in particular to come up with a plan to sell it to members. A giant spending bill might have some issues with conservatives.\"\nA tricky path to welfare reform As for welfare reform, White House officials say they see it as a natural follow up to tax reform: now that they have stimulated the economy, they want to push additional people back into the workforce. They envision changes to the federal SNAP program as well as additional job training.\nAt Camp David this weekend, House Speaker Paul Ryan gave a PowerPoint presentation of House Republican ideas on welfare reform. But Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell has signaled he is not interested in using budget reconciliation \u2014 a rare budgetary maneuver \u2014 to speed the bill along.\nThat makes progress tricky. There's some thought of simply attaching welfare reform on to a larger Farm Bill later in the year.\nThose conversations will continue this weekend as House Republican leaders gather at the Salamander Resort and Spa in Middleburg, Va., and again later this month at a joint House Senate retreat at the Greenbriar Resort in West Virginia.\nIronically, aides insist the one thing not getting in the way of the legislative agenda is the explosive reaction to the Michael Wolff book that drive the final split between Trump and Bannon this week.\n\"A lot of people are conditioned to crazy stories coming from the White House at this point,\" the Capitol Hill aide said.\nWATCH: Special prosecutor likely to seek Trump interview show chapters Special prosecutor likely to seek interview with Trump 4:10 PM ET Mon, 8 Jan 2018 | 01:09"}
{"published":"2018-01-06T18:07:00.000+02:00","title":"Jeff Session's war on pot may become a war on small business","text":"It's easy to get lost in some of the big numbers that get thrown around when it comes to legal marijuana sales. Colorado hit $1 billion in eight months last year. Medical marijuana sales in California last year topped $2 billion. And with the recent launch of legal recreational cannabis sales in that state, sales are expected jump to $5 billion this year.\nBut lost in those boggling figures is a different reality. The vast majority of operations in the legal cannabis field are small businesses. And Attorney General Jeff Sessions ' decision to end an Obama-era policy that let legal marijuana flourish could have big repercussions on those mom and pops.\n\"No question; this is going to have a direct impact on small businesses in the cannabis space,\" says Glenn Ballman, CEO of Duber Technologies, a SaaS company that services the industry, and a cannabis policy expert.\nSessions on Thursday repealed what's known as the Cole memo, a document that generally barred federal law enforcement officials from interfering with marijuana sales in states where the drug is legal. In a one-page memo, he directed federal prosecutors to use their discretion in deciding whether to bring charges against distributors, growers and processors, considering the seriousness of the crime and its impact on the community.\nRobyn Beck | AFP | Getty Images A man calling himself Henry Hemp inhales marijuana using a vaporizer pen at HempCon medical marijuana show. That could have a quick impact on the expansion of the cannabis market, says Ballman, not so much in terms of store openings or customer purchases, but in forward-looking research and development.\n\n\"It's going to have a chilling effect on investment,\" he says. \"You'll see labs not reinvest in better equipment for testing. You'll see producers cut back on expansion plans. And you'll see processors that are buying equipment to make cookies, edibles and drinks start to cut back as well.\"\nThe move also could see companies at risk of racking up tremendous legal bills, should enforcement target their employees.\n\"Exposing your employees to this kind of risk becomes something you think about now,\" says Ballman. \"It's one thing to take risk as an owner. It's another to hire people who are now exposed to that risk. With risk comes cost, potentially in the form of legal fees. If Sessions pushes it back into the realm of mass incarceration ... then you have small businesses that are currently considering expansion or investing into the business that will start taking profits off the table.\"\nPart of the difficulty in forecasting how big of an impact the Sessions memo will have on cannabis-oriented small businesses comes in the uncertainty in how courts will rule when the issue inevitably comes before them.\nEric Risberg | AP Jim Hill looks over the marijuana he grows for medical purposes at his farm in Potter Valley, Calif. Hill believes passionately in marijuana's purported ability to treat the symptoms of diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer's. Mike Sampson, a partner at global law firm Reed Smith LLP in Pittsburgh, notes that while businesses in the marijuana field should certainly be aware of the change in policy, Sessions did not order U.S. attorneys to disrupt the burgeoning industry. That could result in cases being handled differently from district to district.\nUltimately, he says, the issue will come down to how courts determine federal public policy regarding cannabis. If they determine Sessions' memo and subsequent actions don't constitute a true reversal, this could be nothing more than a symbolic act.\n\"The Cole memorandum has been something courts have relied on in determining federal public policy vis-a-vis marijuana,\" he says. \"[In one prominent case], the court said 'there's the Cole memorandum and the government is not pursuing violations, so we can't say there's a public policy against marijuana.' Will they rely on the Sessions memorandum to say 'we now have public policy against cannabis' \u2014 or have events like state legalization overtaken us? ... There's a lot of wait and see here.\"\nDon't, however, expect the Sessions memo to result in landlords and insurance companies changing existing relationships with cannabusinesses, says Sampson. Because those companies knew who they were partnering with (and what the business sold, grew or processed) when they signed the contracts, they likely won't be allowed to hide behind the Controlled Substances Act to get out of the business relationships.\nJustice Department budgeting, also, is something small-business owners will want to pay close attention to. Prosecuting cannabis-focused businesses will take money and, for now at least, there's nothing earmarked for that. Should the department see a notable funding increase, that could be a red flag.\nDespite the new threats, don't expect to see marijuana business shut down pre-emptively to avoid legal prosecution, says Ballman. While a showdown might be looming at some point, that's familiar territory for the industry.\n\"I believe the culture of the industry is that it has been mischaracterized for decades,\" he says. \"The people who run shops today are very much of a generation that fought to get [cannabis] medically licensed. They also fought to get it recreationally legalized. I see them as a generation of fighters. I'd be surprised if any stores close.\""}

The company's global staffing lead and senior recruiter Lisa Stern Haynes says that the tech giant is able to employ the very best because a group of people have to agree on each person that's hired.\nA hiring manager can say no to an applicant for any reason, says Haynes. On the flip side, a hiring manager cannot single-handedly give the \"final yes\" to extend a job offer. All suitable candidates must be passed along to a hiring committee for review.\n\"When managers come to Google for the first time and hear this, especially after years and years of having it a very different way at their previous companies, they're shocked,\" says Haynes.\nBut the tech giant stands by its strategy of making hiring decisions through a team consensus. \"Research tells us that team's that have diverging opinions can make better less biased decisions. And that also applies to the way we make hiring decisions too,\" Haynes explains.\nThe senior recruiter admits that utilizing a hiring committee does slow down the hiring process, although this approach is beneficial for the company in the long run. Haynes explains that you often see employers rushing to settle for a candidate because of time pressure, or even hiring someone due to a preexisting relationship or as a favor to someone.\nThis can lead to a bad hire, which has a really \"long lasting negative effect on a team or a company's culture,\" says Haynes. \"It's way better to take the time and go through a very robust hiring committee on the front end and then identify the best possible candidate the first time around.\"\nThe hiring committees at Google are usually made up of leaders in the specific organization doing the hiring. Members serve on the committee for three to six months before being rotated out of the committee. However, the individual hiring manager is not part of the committee, which Haynes says new managers also find surprising.\nshow chapters Former Google career coach shares a visual trick for making the new year more productive and happy 11:27 AM ET Thu, 21 Dec 2017 | 01:03 Here's how hiring decisions are made, she says: The hiring manager first interviews the candidate and then fills out a hiring packet that includes things like the detailed interview feedback, the recruiter's notes from the initial conversation, internal references if the person knows someone at Google and external references if the person has submitted professional references.\nThe hiring manager then passes this review on to the independent committees. The best part of this chain, says Haynes, is that unlike the hiring manager, committee members are removed from the urgency of selecting someone and are able to judge the applicant based solely on merit.\n\"They're like a layer of objectivity and they're looking to see does this person match the qualification for this immediate role at hand,\" says the lead recruiter. \"Also, are they gonna be a good fit for the organization as a whole for the longer term,\"\nThis is particularly important for a company like Google in which employees jump from team to team and from role to role. In fact, Haynes says that the company values applicants who are problem-solvers and who have a \"general cognitive ability\" over role-related knowledge because positions are constantly shifting.\n\"If you think about how quickly Google changes, if you just hire someone to do one specific job but then our company needs change, we need to be rest assured that that person is going to find something else to do at Google,\" she says. \"That comes back to hiring smart generalists.\"\nLike this story?

But increasingly\u2014with prodding from networks like ESPN\u2014they\u2019re taking a broader view.\nESPN, armed with new data about its viewers, is more aggressively selling its female audience, starting with the College Football Playoff, which culminates in Monday\u2019s championship game. The timing couldn\u2019t be better. Advertisers are looking for new ways to reach women, and more efficiently reach broader audiences, as consumer viewing habits change. \nFinancial services firm Northwestern Mutual is among the advertisers using college football to reach women and families. \nThe company wasn\u2019t new to the playoff, and knew that the sporting event reached a \u201chealthy mix of men and women and families,\u201d but a new pitch and compelling data from ESPN helped the company \u201ccome up with different ad spots\u201d targeting women and families, said Aditi Gokhale, Northwestern Mutual\u2019s chief marketing officer. \nThe new campaign, dubbed \u201cSpend Your Life Living,\u201d includes one ad that follows the story of a female architect who decided to leave her current job to start her own business, with support from Northwestern Mutual. It\u2019s the company\u2019s first TV ad with a storyline focused solely on a woman and her career, said Ms. Gokhale. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a personalized approach,\u201d she said. \nMovie studio Warner Bros., also a longtime ESPN advertiser, is using the game this season to promote its family-friendly film \u201cPaddington 2\u201d to a broad audience of men and women.\n\u201cThe perception was that [college football] was always more male in the past,\u201d said Blair Rich, president of worldwide marketing at Warner Bros. Pictures. \u201cWe used it for male-targeted films or broader films.\u201d Now, the \u201cevidence of what ESPN is showing\u201d is compelling, she said.\nESPN\u2019s sales pitch is an extension of its new marketing strategy to broaden its audience, with the aim of giving a boost to ratings and subscribers. The effort comes as ESPN grapples with a shift from traditional TV viewing to online consumption, leading to cord-cutting and subscriber losses. The network also recently announced that John Skipper resigned as its president, citing substance-abuse issues. \nESPN\u2019s audience makeup during the college football playoffs was fairly consistent year-to-year, according to an ESPN spokeswoman. Still, the company has been making its case to advertisers with newly available data, such as Nielsen metrics that now encompass out-of-home viewing and streaming. \nFor example, ESPN found that its out-of-home audience watching the playoffs skewed slightly more female than its in-home audience, according to Nielsen figures from last year\u2019s playoffs, calculated over a three-game average. Women also saw a larger lift in viewing from out-of-home than men, with a 9.4% lift over in-home audience compared to 7.2% for men. \nDuring last season\u2019s College Football Playoff, 41% of the viewers watching at home were female and 59% were male, not including out-of-home viewing or streaming, according to Nielsen data from ESPN. \nRelying on this kind of audience data in a sales pitch is a shift for ESPN, said Ed Erhardt, president of global sales and marketing at ESPN. \nThe story ESPN is communicating to advertisers is more \u201cabout audience and less about the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sport speaks for itself, and we did a wonderful job for many years of pitching the ascendancy of the College Football Playoff.\u201d \nAdvertisers targeting women aren\u2019t necessary flocking to sports because they think more women are watching sports, explained Jeremy Carey, a managing director at Omnicom\u2019s Optimum Sports. They\u2019re flocking to sports because it\u2019s getting more difficult to reach women through general primetime programming. \nWith general primetime entertainment ratings declining more than sports ratings, advertisers are seeing sports as a more desirable vehicle than it used to be to reach women, he said. And they\u2019re tweaking their creative to be more gender-neutral, accordingly. \n\u201cIf we took top programs that delivered females 18-49, historically you would have found a very large percentage of primetime programming,\u201d he said. In 2017, \u201cabout 75% of those programs are sports now.\u201d That\u2019s a \u201cdrastic shift\u201d in recent years regarding \u201cwhere females are available at mass scale.\u201d \nThe shift in ESPN\u2019s sales strategy is also evidence in how the network is promoting the playoff. The network teamed up with The Bachelor to create a video in which college football mascots, instead of women, compete for the heart of the bachelor during the show\u2019s Rose Ceremony. \nThe network also changed up its media mix to include ad buys reaching female and casual fans, such as The Skimm, YuMe and Spotify. \nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com"}

This succession comes at a pivotal time, as the Company positions itself strategically for its anticipated growth and expansion within the multibillion-dollar cannabis industry.\nSaid MTRAC Chairman of the Board, James Hancock: \"I mentioned in the 2017 year-end review that was distributed last week that MoneyTrac is very much on the verge of significant growth from a revenue perspective. This is due in large part to the hard work and dedication Ms. Luna exhibited in cultivating some incredibly strategic partnerships and acquisitions for the Company. Her elevation to CEO provides the Company with the leadership it will need to foster continued growth and fully capitalize on an industry that is growing faster than any other right now.

Morgan announced a partnership to cut costs and improve services across the health care industry, CNBC's Jim Cramer had to weigh in.\nThe joint venture, organized by Amazon's Jeff Bezos , Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett and J.P. Morgan's Jamie Dimon , will aim to be \"free from profit-making incentives and constraints,\" the companies said on Tuesday.\n\"It's bad enough that the most important man in finance, the most important man in retail and the best investor alive are teaming up to tackle the problems of our health care system, but even worse for the industry, they're doing it for free,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \"It is very hard to compete with someone who doesn't care about turning a profit.\"\nThe initiative elevates the discussion around rising health care costs in the United States, which Cramer said the three titans view as \"the ultimate tax on the system.\"\nIn May 2017, Buffett said that in 50 years, health care has gone from being 5 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) to 17 percent with few solutions in sight to curb surging costs.\n\"Now that's going to change,\" Cramer said. \"Now there is something on the horizon, a company of his own creation with the most technologically savvy provider of what people want and the smartest banker of our time.\"\nThe \"Mad Money\" host also noted the analyst community's eerily calm reaction to the deal. No analyst covering health care retailers like CVS or in-the-line-of-fire middlemen like Express Scripts wants to come out and slash the estimates for those companies right away, he said.\n\"But I bet the analysts who actually cover Jeff, Jamie and Warren's companies \u2014 Amazon, J.P. Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway \u2014 would view this coalition with a very different, awestruck attitude. I'll tell you, if these guys were coming after my business, I'd be terrified,\" Cramer said.\nSome analysts were able to compose sound defenses, including that UnitedHealth's Optum service is already tackling costs and that the middlemen save costs by buying as a group.\nBut Cramer came back with some retorts: the incumbent companies are still not as digitally savvy as this new player will be, and their teams of government lobbyists won't be of any use when it comes to Bezos, Buffett or Dimon.\nWhat does that mean for investors? Cramer's answer was somewhat complicated, particularly for investors who can't wait to get in on the action.\nEven leading players like UnitedHealth aren't safe from being in the \"penalty box\" for some time, he said.\n\"You need a health care company that's survived every onslaught imaginable,\" Cramer said. \"You need a road warrior with a stock that you'll want to load up on into weakness if Amazon talks about this effort on its Thursday night conference call, or the non-profit comes up with a name or a chief executive.\"\nInvestors also need a stock that is cheap with positive prospects that are supported by the technicals, the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\"In short, you need Centene ,\" he said. \"Centene's an expert at providing its clients with high-quality care at the lowest possible costs, and yet it's been making its shareholders a fortune.\"\nCentene, a large, enterprise-facing provider of Medicare and Medicaid, was even blessed by technician Marc Chaikin as one of the best health care stocks on Monday, Cramer added.\nStill, Cramer maintained that buyers should time their investments wisely.\n\"I don't like to enter a blast zone on the first day of a sell-off, especially when there are still plenty of stocks outside the blast zone that have come down,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"So if you want health care exposure, I suggest waiting until the group's a little less radioactive. But if you just can't resist, if you need to pick one up this week, I'd say buy Centene.\"\nWATCH: Cramer talks investment strategy and health care news show chapters Cramer reveals the way to play the Amazon-Berkshire-JP Morgan health care move 21 Hours Ago | 13:07 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of J.P.

Soccer Football - Premier League - Tottenham Hotspur vs Everton - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - January 13, 2018 Tottenham's Harry Kane scores their third goal REUTERS\/Eddie Keogh \nFor a while, it looked as if Kane might be outshone by his team mate Son Heung-min, who scored in a home game for the fifth successive time. \nThen Kane took over to net in the 47th and 59th minutes to take his season\u2019s league tally to 20, the fourth consecutive campaign he has reached the landmark. \nChristian Eriksen rounded off a cleverly worked team move, again featuring Son, for Spurs\u2019 fourth as Everton crashed to their heaviest defeat under Sam Allardyce, who gave a debut to 27 million pound ($37 million) new signing Cenk Tosun. \nWith three of the top four not playing, fifth-placed Tottenham moved level with Liverpool on 44 points, three behind Chelsea. Antonio Conte\u2019s side missed the chance to go second as Leicester hung on for a draw at Stamford Bridge despite the 68th-minute dismissal of Ben Chilwell. \nIt was the third successive game in all competitions that Chelsea failed to score, with striker Alvaro Morata looking frustrated and short of confidence. \nManager Conte believes they are paying the price for playing seven games in three weeks, with no let-up in prospect as they contest four competitions. \u201cI think I saw a lot of very tired players,\u201d Conte said. \nElsewhere, there were more controversial refereeing decisions as English football continued to debate whether the video assistant referee (VAR) system, which was tested in some cup games last week, would benefit the Premier League. \nThe first flashpoint occurred at Vicarage Road where TV replays revealed Watford\u2019s Abdoulaye Doucoure bundled the ball over the line with his right hand in the 2-2 draw with Southampton. \nA seventh Premier League defeat in eight games had looked likely for Marco Silva\u2019s side after James Ward-Prowse scored twice but Andre Gray set up a thrilling finale before Doucoure\u2019s contribution led to furious Southampton protests.

But the Scot has proved all the doubters wrong with the London side scoring 12 goals from his past five league games in charge. \nA Manuel Lanzini double plus strikes from Mark Noble and the impressive Marko Arnautovic gave the visitors a comfortable victory that took them above Huddersfield, for whom Joe Lolley scored and new 14 million pound ($19.2 million) signing Alex Pritchard came on as a substitute. \nThe win was Moyes\u2019 200th in the Premier League, a landmark reached by only three other managers. \nAt Selhurst Park, Crystal Palace\u2019s revival under Roy Hodgson continued with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Burnley which moved them five points above the relegation zone. \nAlan Pardew was another manager breathing easier after West Bromwich Albion beat Brighton & Hove Albion 2-0 to record their first win in 21 league games and his first in nine as their manager. \nBoth Albion goals came via headers from Chris Brunt corners, with Jonny Evans and Craig Dawson rising above Brighton\u2019s defence.

The move is also a new salvo in its ongoing competition with Amazon, which thanks to its market-leading Kindle, commands about 83% of the U.S. e-books market, according to estimates. Apple (aapl) and bookstore chain Barnes & Noble (bks) are big e-book players too, though they trail far behind. \nBut Walmart is jumping on a declining category: last year, Americans bought about 490 million e-books, or roughly 17% of the book market. Digital books as a percentage of total sales peaked at about 23% five years ago and have since slipped. In the first eight months of 2017, e-book sales fell 5.3% while physical books edged up, according to the Association of American Publishers. Still, for Walmart, the move is consistent with its strategy to aggressively increase its online assortment and compete more directly with Amazon, even on its own turf. Walmart\u2019s U.S. online sales rose 50% in its most recent full quarter . \nKobo, which had tried to make a big U.S. breakthrough at the start of the decade in a partnership with now bankrupt bookseller Borders , offers six million e-books. Its readers, which compete with Amazon\u2019s Kindle and Barnes & Noble\u2019s struggling Nook, will be available at 4,000 Walmart stores. That is likely to boost Kobo\u2019s tiny share of the U.S. e-books market share and turn it into a serious contender. (Kobo, a big presence in markets like Canada and the Japan, sold about 1.25 million books in the U.S. last year.) \nWalmart also announced another key partnership with Kobo\u2019s parent Rakuten, the largest Japanese online retailer. Starting sometime in the summer or early fall, Walmart subsidiary Seiyu, will launch a new online grocery service in Japan. The joint venture will include the creation of a fulfillment center dedicated to grocery delivery as well as equipping Seiyu stores to make deliveries. Walmart operates about 341 stores in Japan. \n\u201cRakuten is a strong e-commerce business and we\u2019re excited to collaborate wit the top online shopping destination in Japan,\u201d Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement ahead of a meeting in Tokyo Thursday morning local time with Rakuten CEO Hiroshi Mikitani. \nIt\u2019s not the first time Walmart teams up with a local e-commerce leader in a market it wants to grow in: the company teams up in China with JD.com, and now offers one-hour delivery form 140 stores there. Last quarter, total China sales rose 4%. Walmart offers delivery of online grocery orders in several countries including Britain, Canada, and Mexico. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

{"published":"2018-01-02T18:30:00.000+02:00","title":"Amazon Alexa is opening up to more sponsored product ads","text":"Amazon is turning to Alexa and asking it to build a big digital advertising business.\nThe e-tailer has been in talks with several companies about letting them promote products on the best-selling Echo devices, which are powered by the Alexa voice assistant, according to several people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Consumer companies, including Procter & Gamble and Clorox, have been involved in these talks, according to the people.\nSome of the early discussions have centered on whether companies would pay for higher placement if a user searches for a product such as shampoo on the device, similar to how paid searches work in Google.\nThe move by Amazon, which right now does very little advertising on the Echo, could mean big things for consumer companies that are fretting their influence on a voice-powered shopping experience.\nWith Alexa's clout anticipated to rise, brands are worried about being left out of the voice-shopping platform entirely. Advertisers and brands are particularly focused on search placement on Alexa because shoppers are more likely to select a top result on a voice assistant than they are on the web, where it's easy to scroll down or ignore written suggestions.\nAmazon has hinted in the past that it will launch a paid search ad product for Alexa, but sources said that the latest talks show the e-commerce giant is preparing to make a serious run at the ad market as early as this year.\nshow chapters Amazon in talks with P&G, Clorox for Alexa ads: Sources 3 Hours Ago | 01:12 CNBC reported last week that Amazon is testing a number of ad types, including videos, for 2018.\nWhile Amazon dominates online commerce, its web advertising business ranks fifth among U.S. companies, according to eMarketer . Amazon's ad sales, which today mostly come from sponsored listings on the website, will grow 42 percent in 2018 to $2.4 billion, still putting the company way behind Google at $40.1 billion and Facebook at $21.6 billion, eMarketer said.\nWith Alexa, where advertising is currently limited, Amazon is in talks to offer companies a variety of promotional opportunities, including some that are already being tested.\nOne experiment in the works is letting companies target users based on past shopping behavior. For example, Alexa may suggest to a shopper who previously bought Clorox's Pine-Sol to consider buying its disinfecting wipes. Amazon is also looking to tap advertising in Alexa's skills. Someone asking the Echo for help cleaning up a spill might be nudged to use a specific brand.\nshow chapters Amazon is planning a push into digital advertising in 2018 11:19 AM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 | 00:50 There are already some sponsorships on Alexa that aren't tied to a user's history. If a shopper asks Alexa to buy toothpaste, one response is, \"Okay, I can look for a brand, like Colgate . What would you like?\"\nColgate did not respond to a request for comment. Clorox declined to comment.\nAs Amazon goes deeper with Alexa, it will likely be attempting to combine the popularity of the voice-powered devices with its wealth of consumer data to create more targeted opportunities for brand advertisers.\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment.\nVoice and artificial intelligence represent a new frontier for consumer giants, who are adjusting to non-visual formats. Consumer brands are expert at promoting their products in stores by manipulating packaging and shelving, and they're effective with commercials and traditional web ads, where they have screen space to showcase their products.\nNow that people are shopping by voice without browsing, advertisers have to find new ways of getting in front of them.\n\"In these early days, artificial intelligence doesn't appear to recognize brand value, and it doesn't articulate it,\" said Greg Stemler, Ernst & Young's U.S. consumer products and retail leader for transaction advisory services. \"It may be a real challenge for branded consumer packaged goods companies to readjust.\"\n'New brick and mortar' They don't have much of a choice. The number of people in the U.S. using voice-enabled speakers more than doubled in 2017 to 36 million, with Amazon capturing 71 percent of the market, according to a prediction from eMarketer. The Alexa app recently topped the Apple App store , and Amazon said it sold \"tens of millions\" of Alexa devices over the holidays.\nAmazon is \"the new brick and mortar,\" said Matt Borchard, media director at ad agency Noble People. For brands, \"just like they need to spend money for placement in-store, they need to spend money for placement on Amazon.\"\nStill, voice represents a new medium with unpredictable results. Radio-style commercials don't work for most of the ways that people use the devices, and newer types of ads have hit early speed bumps. In June, a start-up called VoiceLabs, which was trying to help developers monetize their Alexa apps with ads, shut down after Amazon changed its policies to restrict promotions in Alexa skills.\nIn 2017, Procter & Gamble slashed up to $140 million in digital advertising spend, which the company deemed to be ineffective.\nIn Alexa's current narrow use of advertising, it allows skills such as streaming music, radio, podcast or flash briefings to have ads, as long as the voice doesn't sound like or refer to Alexa. For example, CNBC announced recently that it will begin selling sponsorship opportunities on its skill . Ads can also be used in skills that help customers order products. If a person asks to order pizza, Alexa may indicate what deals are available.\n\"We have to come up with the right monetization opportunity,\" said Doug Rozen, chief digital and innovation officer at media agency OMD. \"But it can't get in the way of what we are trying to use these devices for.\""}

And now his former personal assistant has been accused of stealing hundreds of bottles worth $1.2 million from his private collection. \nNicolas De-Meyer, 40, was identified in an indictment unsealed Wednesday by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who say he used a fake name, \"Mark Miller,\" to sell hundreds of bottles of the stolen wine to a North Carolina wine dealer he had found on the internet from 2014 to 2016. \nThe indictment didn't name Solomon, but Goldman confirmed his identity after press inquiries. De-Meyer was an employee of Solomon's household, not the bank. \"The theft was discovered in the fall of 2016 and reported to law enforcement at that time,\" a Goldman spokesman said in an email. \"They have been pursuing the matter.\" \nThat would correspond with the sale of Solomon's 5,400-square-foot apartment around the same time. The four-bedroom unit with a Central Park view and a 1,000-bottle wine storage area sold in November 2016 for $21.5 million. \nAccording to the indictment, De-Meyer worked for an \"individual who collects rare and expensive wine\" from 2008 to November 2016, and his duties included receiving shipments of wine at his boss's Manhattan apartment and transporting wine from there to a property in East Hampton, New York. \nAmong the stolen items were seven bottles from the French estate Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, or DRC, which prosecutors say is considered among the best, most expensive and rarest in the world. The average price of a bottle of the pinot noir from Burgundy is $17,134, according to Wine-searcher.com. The victim had bought the bottles for $133,650, prosecutors said. \nDe-Meyer stole the Romanee-Conti wine in October 2016 from his boss's Manhattan apartment, the indictment said. \nDe-Meyer was arrested in Los Angeles on Tuesday, according to a spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor's office in New York.

Body language is important. In fact, your non-verbal signals are responsible for communicating 55 percent of your message .\nIf you keep getting passed up for a coveted promotion or are frequently perplexed by how exchanges with co-workers end up not the way you intended, it just might be time to get some feedback about the non-verbal messages you send at work. Ask a trusted mentor or colleague for honest feedback, practice dialogue in front of the mirror or video yourself to see opportunities you have for improvement.\nIf you exhibit any of the body language mistakes to avoid at work that I outline below, it's time to commit to breaking the habit.\nMore from Bernard Marr:\n9 simple tricks to boost your confidence at work\n10 more tell-tale signs that you have a great boss\n7 habits successful people avoid\n1. Concentration face instead of smiles Even though many of you who don't smile often at work aren't necessarily grumpy and dissatisfied, that's what your face conveys. When you walk into a meeting, smile. When you talk on the phone, smile. People want to interact with positive and confident people, so do what you can to plaster a smile on your face whenever you can. And, it's not just good for others. Smiling or even forcing a smile will reduce your stress and make you happier.\n2. Wimpy handshake The way you connect with another when you grab their hand in a handshake is important. You should have good posture, a firm (not rigid) shake and look them in the eye. These actions exude your self-assuredness. A wimpy grip just opens you up to be misunderstood by those you interact with.\n3. Hand placement In addition to your handshake, your hands play an important role in complementing or distracting from your verbal communication. If you are too animated with your hands while you speak, others may believe you're unprofessional and immature. Yet, you should use your hands when you speak, because according to a study by Colgate University people are more likely to listen to you when you do. Those that hide their hands when interacting with others are often viewed as untrustworthy.\n4. Breaking eye contact When interviewing for a job, most of us know it's important to maintain eye contact with the person across the table yet some of us forget to continue this practice once on the job. While you shouldn't stare at the other person, your gaze shouldn't dart back and forth across the room or break away too soon.\nWhen someone is speaking to you, look them in the eye\u2014not at your phone, your computer or your notepad. Eye contact helps connection and builds trust. And, no matter how irritated you are, follow your mom's rules from when you were a teen and never roll your eyes. That's just rude."}

There's not going to be anything coming off the Illinois River for a couple of weeks,\" said a grain barge trader who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media. \nSoybean barges loaded in January and delivered to the Gulf traded as high as 50 cents over Chicago Board of Trade March futures, the highest since late September. January corn barges traded at 47 cents above CBOT March futures, a 10-month high. \nCME Group Inc, which owns the CBOT, said it is monitoring the icy conditions on the river, where its approved delivery stations are located. The exchange's January soybean contract is currently in delivery. \n\"At present the majority of regular shipping stations are able to make\/take deliveries,\" spokesman Chris Grams said in an email. \nWHEAT RALLY CONTINUES \nBenchmark HRW wheat prices on the Chicago Board of Trade on Wednesday climbed to the highest since Nov. 22 on worries over deteriorating crop conditions. \nTemperatures in central and southwest Kansas, eastern Colorado and northern Oklahoma were low enough for long enough on Monday to damage or kill some dormant hard red winter (HRW) wheat, which is milled for flour to make bread and pizza crust. \nHow broad the damage was will not be clear until the crop breaks dormancy in late winter or spring. \nCrop conditions in Kansas, the top HRW producer, are already deteriorating. The U.S. Department of Agriculture rated just 37 percent of the crop in good to excellent condition at the end of December, down from 51 percent a month earlier. \nColder air across the U.S. Plains lifted benchmark CME live cattle futures to a seven-week high late last week as beef packers rushed to secure livestock. Prices are expected to ramp higher this week as frigid weather may slow weight gains in cattle and make it difficult to sort and load livestock - which limits their availability to processors. \n\"Late last week and this week on the cattle market there has been some difficulties in transporting animals and even meat in some areas of the Plains, Upper Midwest and in the Eastern United States,\" said Colorado-based Livestock Marketing Information Center Director Jim Robb. \n(Reporting by Karl Plume in Chicago; Additional reporting by Theopolis Waters in Chicago; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"}

Red arrows on the screen identified them as they led attacks on police and buildings.\nIn 2009, the \u201cGreen Movement\u201d accused of stoking months of mass protests had two clear figureheads. Both have been under house arrest since 2011 though neither has been formally charged or appeared in court.\nTEN KILLED The latest unrest began on Thursday when hundreds of people took to the streets of Iran\u2019s second city Mashhad to protest against economic hardships and alleged corruption.\nBut in a rare political challenge, they were soon calling for clerical leaders including the ultimate authority in Iran\u2019s cumbersome system of dual clerical and republican rule - Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - to step down.\nSince Thursday, tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets across Iran, alarming the government and the clerical leadership.\nTen people were killed during protests on Sunday, state television reported, as unsigned statements posted on social media sites called for new demonstrations in the capital Tehran and 50 other cities.\nIn a ratcheting up of tensions, protesters tried to take over some military bases and police stations but were pushed back by security forces, state TV said without elaborating.\nPresident Hassan Rouhani struck a conciliatory tone as demonstrators widened their targets from police vehicles and banks to seminaries in a direct challenge to the country\u2019s religious establishment.\n\u201cWhat has happened in the past few days may appear as a threat but we have to turn it into an opportunity and see what the problem is,\u201d ISNA news agency Quote: d Rouhani as saying on Sunday.\nHe even contradicted the usual conspiracy theories that blame Western powers and Israel for Iran\u2019s woes, stressing the need to get to the root causes of the problem.\n\u201cAll these people are not getting orders from abroad, and some have gone out to the streets because of their feelings and problems,\u201d he said.\nLawmaker Jorjik Abramian was also measured in his response to growing frustrations with unemployment that hit 28.8 percent last year and alleged graft that prompted some Iranians to describe their government as thieves.\n\u201cThe recent events are due to an accumulation of people\u2019s demands that have been ignored,\u201d ILNA news agency Quote: d him as saying. \u201cWe must restore the trust of the people in the authorities. If this happens, no foreign agent can carry out his aims in the country.\u201d\nThe 2009 protests following the disputed re-election of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad were eventually crushed by the state security apparatus, headed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its affiliated Basij militia volunteers.\nILNA said Abramian warned against any \u201crepeat of Kahrizak\u201d -a reference to an infamous detention centre outside Tehran where three detainees were killed and many tortured in 2009, according to human rights campaigners.\nAVOIDING FLASHPOINTS Protesters, for their part, also don\u2019t seem to have a clear plan, other than defying the security forces and even the elite Revolutionary Guards.\nThe security forces may be showing restraint this time to avoid bloodshed that could galvanise and embolden protesters. But that has not stopped leading conservatives calling for tough measures.\n\u201cThose who commit sabotage and spread unrest should be dealt with and dealt with firmly,\u201d judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani said in remarks carried on state television.\nWith few options at hand, some Iranian leaders lashed out again at the United States. A top military official said support for the protesters expressed by U.S. President Trump and other U.S. officials showed Washington had ulterior motives.\n\u201cThe involvement of top U.S. leaders along with other states and media outlets ... suggest that America is planning to launch a new sedition in Iran,\u201d armed forces spokesman Masoud Jazayeri, who is also a Revolutionary Guards commander, was Quote: d as saying by the state broadcaster IRIB\u2019s website.\nBut that has failed so far to divert the attention of Iranians away from their problems at home.\nIran\u2019s leaders believe they can count on support from many of the generation that took part in the 1979 revolution because of their ideological commitment and the economic gains they have made under the Islamic government, analysts say.\nBut the growing number of youths taking to the streets suggests the old guard may have to compromise and give in to some of their demands, analysts say.\nReporting by Dubai newsroom; editing by David Clarke\n "}

Pesquera\u2019s team is to present findings within 90 days, according to a statement issued in Spanish from Rossello\u2019s office.\n\u201cAs part of the recovery process, it is important to guarantee transparency in the damages caused to the lives and safety of our citizens,\u201d Rossello said.\nHis administration\u2019s official death toll from the storm sits at 64. Maria - the most powerful hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years - decimated local infrastructure, and nearly half the island\u2019s 3.4 million residents remain without power three-and-a-half months later.\nThe governor came under fire as families and nursing home officials complained that the death toll did not match anecdotal evidence of an increase in deaths as vulnerable residents struggled to get timely medical care.\nA November study by a Pennsylvania State University researcher found the toll could be 10 times higher than the government\u2019s figure. A December study by the New York Times, which compared recent mortality data with historical averages, found that Maria may be responsible for as many as 1,052 deaths.\nUnder Rossello\u2019s executive order, Pesquera is to work with Puerto Rico\u2019s demographic registry and bureau of forensic sciences to establish procedures for the analysis.\nMaria was a major blow to an already-woebegone island, whose $120 billion in combined bond and pension debt triggered the largest-ever U.S. government bankruptcy filing last May.\nPuerto Rico\u2019s benchmark general obligation bond price, which already trading at a steep discount, cratered in Maria\u2019s wake, dipping to around 20 cents on the dollar.

{"published":"2018-01-08T02:00:00.000+02:00","title":"Stocks: Why Your Index Funds Have Too Much Tech | Fortune","text":"By Shawn Tully January 5, 2018 \nIn recapping the stock market\u2019s strong performance in 2017, the bulls invariably laud the tech titans as the force that, more than any other, propelled the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to record after record. It\u2019s chiefly the power of these world champions , the Wall Street crowd crows, that will make 2018 another double-digit winner for shareholders. \nFor the tens of millions of Americans who rely on index funds, however, the tech explosion may well prove the just the opposite\u2014a heavy drag on their future returns. \nHere\u2019s why. Most index funds, whether ETFs or mutual funds, are what\u2019s called \u201ccap weighted.\u201d In an S&P 500 fund, if a stock or group of stocks in the same industry way outpaces the overall index, you as an investor will suddenly own far more of that company, or that industry, as a share of your holdings. As the prices of high flyers soar\u2014and with them, their market capitalization\u2014the index fund automatically gorges on those hot stocks. Your portfolio gets heavily weighted in the priciest companies, while sloughing off the laggards. \nThe problem is that, over time, doubling down on the most expensive companies generally hammers future performance. \u201cDecades of research shows that a methodology that lowers exposure to the most expensive stocks, and favors cheaper shares, produces the best returns,\u201d says Vitali Kalesnik of Research Affiliates, a firm that oversees investment strategies for $200 billion in mutual funds and ETFs. That\u2019s the familiar \u201cvalue\u201d strategy pioneered by Benjamin Graham and championed by Warren Buffett. By contrast, the cap-weighted approach tilts heavily towards growth stocks sporting high PE multiples that reflect big expectations for future earnings, and shuns the \u201cdogs\u201d that can produce strong returns just by being mediocre\u2014and over long periods, do a lot better. How your index fund became a tech fund \nIt\u2019s hard to find a better case study on how index funds load up on hot, expensive stocks than the tech bonanza of 2017. What we\u2019ll call the FAAMG companies, Facebook (fb) , Apple (aapl) , Amazon (amzn) , Microsoft (msft) , and Google (owned by Alphabet) (goog) , posted average gains of 47.3% last year . Those five players alone accounted for 5.2 percentage points of the S&P\u2019s total gain of 23.7%. \nLet\u2019s look at the FAAMGs as one big company, and examine how the gigantic jump in their combined value raised their weight in one S&P index fund. \nAt the start of 2017, FAAMG Inc.\u2019s total market cap was $2.09 trillion, and it accounted for 11.06% of the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF managed by Blackrock. By the close of last year, its value had surged to $3.01 trillion, or 44%, raising its weight in the ETF to 13.36%. In other words, your investment in FAAMG rose by one-fifth last year, and the portion of your total ETF portfolio sitting in FAAMG increased by 2.3 percentage points. \nThat wouldn\u2019t be so troublesome if FAAMG\u2019s earnings had risen as much, or almost as much, as the astounding spike in its price. But that didn\u2019t happen. By Fortune \u2018s reckoning, FAAMG earned a total of $93.9 billion in 2016, and finished the year with a PE multiple of 22. In 2017, its combined profits rose 21.8%, but its \u201cstock price\u201d more than doubled, raising its PE to 27, effectively making FAAMG more than one-fifth more expensive. That PE was four points higher than the S&P 500\u2019s overall multiple at year end. It\u2019s important to note that FAAMG\u2019s biggest earning unit by far, Apple, is showing no pattern of growing earnings . \nRaising the holding in one enterprise from 11.1% to 13.4% of a portfolio may not sound like much. But it can have a significant impact on future returns because of the phenomenon of \u201cmean reversion,\u201d or the tendency of trends, after they veer off in one direction, to return to normal. Let\u2019s say our goal is a gain of 10% next year for our S&P index fund. Now imagine that FAAMG returns to its 2017 weight of 11%. In that case, FAAMG would drop 10.3%, giving back one-quarter of its gain for 2017. So to reach our 10% target, the rest of the S&P would need to rise almost 13%. \nPut another way, if the performance of the FAAMG hotshots ever returns to something like normal, the rest of your portfolio will have to work that much harder. A better way to index? \nFortunately, a better option exists. Research Affiliates has pioneered an approach known as \u201cfundamental indexing.\u201d Instead of weighting companies by their market cap, fundamental indexing establishes their share of the index based on their economic footprint. That heft is determined by a combination of four factors: sales; dividends plus buybacks; book value; and cash flows. Hence, if a company\u2019s stock-market value soars far above its economic weight, indicating that it\u2019s relatively expensive, the fund will lower its holdings in the pricey stock and boost its holdings in stocks whose value lags their overall size. \nResearch Affiliates\u2019 RAFI U.S. Index uses the four-point criteria for economic heft rather than market cap. It\u2019s used in a variety of funds covering different universes of stocks, including the PowerShares FTSE RAFI U.S. 1000, Almost all of the S&P 500 stocks would be included in that and other funds using the RAFI index. And as a result, the way it weights those big caps stocks is starkly different than that of a typical S&P index fund. \nAt year end, the share of the RAFI U.S. index in FAAMG was just 6%, less than half the proportion in the iShare Core S&P 500. Its Apple holding was 2.3%, versus 3.8% in the iShares fund. \nThe RAFI index features a far bigger proportion of low market cap stocks, and a lot less of the high-flyers. For example, tech and healthcare, the two priciest sectors, accounted for just 25.7% of the RAFI U.S. at the close of 2017, almost ten points below the 35% share for the iShares Core S&P. \nSo how has it performed? Precisely because such a small number of stocks accounted for so much of the 2017 rally, the RAFI U.S. index lagged the S&P 500 over the past year, by 3.7 points (18.1% to 21.8%, including dividends). Over the past five years, though, the two were roughly even. And backtesting the RAFI method, you\u2019ll find that it would have beaten the S&P by an average of 2.24 pts, 9.44% to 7.20%, over the past 20 years. Those extra percentage points would add up to a lot: After 20 years, a theoretical RAFI investor would have had about 50% more money in her portfolio than someone who stuck with a cap-weighted S&P fund. \nIndex funds, including ETFs and mutual funds, are a great, low-cost choice for investors . But the chase-the-pricey stuff, sell-what\u2019s-cheap mechanics present a challenge. The solution for someone with a long time horizon: Go contrarian. Fundamental indexing, which by its very nature dumps what\u2019s hot and buys what\u2019s unloved, fits that bill. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

Instead of the previous lenient federal enforcement policy, Sessions' new stance will let federal prosecutors decide how aggressively to enforce longstanding federal law prohibiting cannabis sale, production and use.\nSessions' decision caused immediate outrage from the cannabis community, especially in California where just three days ago a new legalization law for cannabis went into effect. Cannabis industry leaders, led by BudTrader CEO Brad McLaughlin, quickly organized to combat what McLaughlin says is a blatant slap in the face to voters nationwide who have voted to legalize cannabis in 29 states and the District of Columbia.\n\"I have spoken to my legal advisers and other cannabis industry leaders,\" says McLaughlin, \"We're united in our decision to call for the immediate resignation and removal of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General of the United States of America.\"\nWith this unprecedented move, McLaughlin says Sessions is going against the will of the people (more than 64 percent of Americans support legalization of cannabis).\n\"When one of our highest elected officials shows complete disregard for public majority opinion, he needs to be removed from office,\" McLaughlin continues. \"His agenda is not the agenda of the people.\"\nWithin hours of Sessions' announcement early Thursday morning, BudTrader had already begun collecting signatures on a petition, available on the front page of BudTrader.com . Other cannabis industry leaders have rallied with BudTrader and have added their signatures to the petition.\nMcLaughlin and the team at BudTrader are no strangers to vocal cannabis advocacy. As the largest online medical marijuana marketplace with over one-million registered users across the U.S., BudTrader has made it a point to use its stature in the industry as a platform to campaign for safe access to cannabis for all.\nThose wanting to sign the petition calling for the ouster of Attorney General Sessions can find the petition at https:\/\/budtrader.com\/statement-regarding-attorney-general-jeff-sessions .\nMedia Contact\nMarie Bowers\nCommunications Director\nBudTrader.com\nmarie@budtrader.com\nView original content with multimedia: http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/budtrader-ceo-brad-mclaughlin-leads-the-call-for-sessions-resignation-due-to-his-reversal-of-states-cannabis-rights-300578072.html\nSOURCE BudTrader.com"}

FILE PHOTO: A pumpjack brings oil to the surface in the Monterey Shale, California, April 29, 2013. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo \nWhile shares in top energy companies have risen since mid-2017, they have failed to keep step with recovering crude markets, opening up a historically unusual performance gap. Big oil stocks have also underperformed broader equity indexes. \nUncertainty over whether the crude rally can stick and fears that advances in electric vehicles will undermine longer-term demand for oil still overshadow the sector. \nBut a brighter outlook for oil prices compared with the slump of 2014-15 - coupled with a revival in energy companies\u2019 profits and cash generation after three years of brutal cuts - could mark a turning point, according to investors and a string of global banks. \n\u201c2017 was a challenging year for investors but there are now real opportunities in the energy sector,\u201d said Olivia Markham, portfolio manager at BlackRock Commodities Income Investment Trust. She expects oil prices to rise gradually by 2020 as supplies tighten due to a dive in investment in recent years. \nUBS, RBC and JP Morgan have put out strongly positive outlooks for the sector in recent weeks, while Barclays analysts predicted on Thursday that earnings for the European integrated oil stocks could grow 20 percent from the third quarter. \nOptimists point to developments like Shell\u2019s ( RDSa.L ) raising in November of its cash flow outlook to $30 billion from $25 billion by 2020, assuming prices at $60 a barrel. \n\u201cAnnus Mirabilis. Highest free cashflow in a decade bodes well for 2018,\u201d Bernstein said in its outlook for European oil majors. \nFigures for last year are grim, due largely to a dismal first half. The MSCI world energy index .dMIWO0EN00PUS, which tracks top oil stocks, gained just 1.3 percent even though Brent crude hit 2-1\/2 year highs. Europe\u2019s oil and gas sector.SXEP, which includes Shell, Total ( TOTF.PA ), BP ( BP.L ) and Eni ( ENI.MI ), was the worst-performing in the region. LITTLE CONVICTION \nOil majors\u2019 shares typically move in step with prices of the crude that they extract, but that correlation broke down last year. Since June, the MSCI index has gained 20 percent but Brent LCOc1 shot up 50 percent to around $68 a barrel, after OPEC and other major producers agreed to cut output. \nThe majors are set to cut spending on oil and gas exploration for a fifth year in a row in 2018, determined to maintain the capital discipline they imposed during the slump. \nWith production from U.S. shale deposits expected to increase sharply, scepticism remains over whether crude can stay at current levels. \n\u201cThere\u2019s little conviction on the oil price sustainability both from the market and from the oil majors because no one is touching capex plans or investment. Everyone is waiting to understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Angelo Meda, head of equities at Italian fund manager Banor SIM. \nAs well as slashing spending, the majors made tens of thousands of staff redundant and sold off assets to adapt to lower oil prices which, despite the recent gains, remain far below levels above $100 in 2011-14. Such savings have led to sharp increases in earnings in recent quarters. \nWhether the sector can extend the share rally and close the performance gap in 2018 depends on a belief that majors can still prosper should oil prices fall back again. \n\u201cFrom here it\u2019s a question of whether or not investors think something has really changed in the industry, that you can still have earnings improving even if the macro doesn\u2019t help you out,\u201d said Peter Hackworth, oil equity analyst at Goldman Sachs. \nAs well as the strong cash flow generation at the European majors, early signs of capital discipline among U.S. explorers and producers also point to a better picture for the sector this year. \nGoldman predicts big oil firms will return 13 percent in 2018, ahead of a forecast 9 percent rise in the Brent price. SCRAPPING THE SCRIP \nOne crucial component in winning back investors\u2019 confidence is a return to paying dividends fully in cash. Offering the option of taking dividends in stock has saved the majors billions upfront but diluted their earnings per share. \nShell and BP have both made enough revenue in recent quarters to boost their payouts. Goldman Sachs estimates most big oil firms will have scrapped scrip dividends or made share buy-backs which offset the dilution in the next 12 months. \nAverage dividend yields of 5.5 percent will be more than covered by cash flow this year, Hackworth said. \nBut not all investors have yet accepted the message that current payout levels will continue. \n\u201cThe market is still discounting these dividends as unsustainable whereas today, right now, they are sustainable. So I think the market is overreacting,\u201d said Eric Moore, European income fund manager at Miton, who has been increasing his oil holdings in the past year. \nMoore\u2019s fund holds BP, Shell, Statoil ( STL.OL ), Eni and Premier Oil. ( PMO.L ) \nAnalysts have also been revising up their earnings forecasts since October after sharp downgrades earlier in 2017. Any uptick in   - noticeably absent as the majors concentrated on restructuring rather than purchases during the slump \u2013 could also boost the sector. \nPEAK DEMAND? \nInvestors remain wary that oil demand may peak due to eventual mass adoption of battery-powered cars and more curbs on fossil fuel emissions by industry to meet environmental targets. \n\u201cElectric vehicles and government policies on carbon have led investors to question the longer-term outlook for oil,\u201d Blackrock\u2019s Markham said. \nSome are hedging their bets, buying shares in battery companies and chipmakers involved in making electric cars while lessening their exposure to pure oil plays. \nBut the shift to cleaner energy doesn\u2019t necessarily mean investors are dumping the oil majors. Many are sticking with them but favouring companies which put more emphasis on renewables. \nNick Davis, European income fund manager at Polar Capital, said he prefers Total, which is investing more in gas as well as venturing into battery and solar power. \nBut in the shorter term, and with the electric vehicle picture still unclear, stocks do not yet fully price in these risks, analysts said. \nEvercore ISI analyst Doug Terreson said cash preservation remains the key for investors focussing on returns more than growth. For him, BP, Shell, Chevron ( CVX.N ) and ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) offer the best proposition in 2018, he said in a note. \n\u201cThe historical investment model which assumed that higher oil prices would always lead to higher share prices in energy appears disrupted. It failed in 2017 and will again in 2018, in our view.\u201d \nFor a graphic on oil prices and energy shares, click tmsnrt.rs\/2Ckd7nw Reporting by Helen Reid and Ron Bousso, Editing by Dmitry Zhdannikov and David Stamp"}

That compares with an increase of $10 billion in November. \nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected reserves to rise by $6 billion to $3.125 trillion. \nCapital flight had been seen as a major risk for China at the start of 2017, but a combination of tighter capital controls and a faltering dollar helped the yuan stage a strong turnaround, bolstering confidence in the economy. \nThe yuan rose around 6.8 percent against the greenback in 2017, recovering from a 6.5 percent loss in 2016 and reversing three straight years of depreciation. \nFor the full year, China\u2019s FX reserves rose $129.5 billion from $3.011 trillion at the end of 2016. That\u2019s the first annual rise since 2014. \nChina\u2019s foreign exchange regulator said in a statement on its website that it would keep the nation\u2019s forex reserves and international balance of payments \u201cbalanced and stable\u201d in 2018. \nThe country\u2019s reserves dropped by nearly $1 trillion from a peak of $3.99 trillion in June 2014 to $2.998 trillion in January 2017 as it sought to shore up the yuan and reduce potentially destabilizing capital outflows. But reserves have since climbed by $142 billion. \nDespite the improved capital flow picture, China\u2019s State Administration of Foreign Exchange has continued a clampdown on the movements of funds abroad. The regulator announced last month it would cap overseas withdrawals by people using domestic Chinese bank cards starting this year. \nSome major global acquisitions by Chinese firms have also been put on ice by regulators, who fear they are really intended to disguise movements of capital offshore, though Beijing has maintained genuine investments will still be approved. \nChina\u2019s central bank reported net foreign exchange buying for the third consecutive month in November, marking a policy victory for the authorities after a long battle to stabilize the yuan, although analysts say capital flows are likely to remain volatile as the economy slows. \nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the yuan to depreciate slightly this year if the dollar firms. \nThe value of gold reserves rose to $76.47 billion at the end of December, from $75.833 billion at the end of November, data on the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s website showed.

REUTERS\/Norihiko Shirouzu\/Files The reading suggested surprising resilience in the world\u2019s second-largest economy at the end of the year, though it was somewhat at odds with a much larger official survey on Sunday that pointed to a slight loss of momentum.\nThe Caixin\/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 last month, from 50.8 in November, and far outpacing economists\u2019 expectations for a slight dip to 50.6.\nThe 50-mark divides expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.\nAnalysts have expected some softening in China\u2019s manufacturing activity as a punishing crackdown on air pollution, a cooling property market and higher borrowing costs all start to weigh on the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\nThat view appeared to be borne out by the official data at the weekend which suggested that production expanded in December at a slightly more modest pace.\nBut Caixin\u2019s findings showed output grew at the fastest pace in three months, bolstered by improving demand.\nTotal new orders at home and from abroad rose at the strongest pace since August, with the sub-index jumping to 53.0 in December from 51.8 the previous month.\nThe Caixin survey tends to focus on small and mid-sized firms which are believed to be more export-oriented.\nWhile the official data pointed to a wobble in production, it also showed a pickup in overseas orders which should help support China\u2019s exporters in the next few months.\nPRICE PRESSURES However, despite the increase in new work, the Caixin survey indicated manufacturers continued to shed staff in December and input costs continued to rise sharply, largely due to higher prices for raw materials.\nCompanies were able to pass on some of those cost increases to customers, suggesting broader inflationary pressures may intensify in China this year. The official data pointed to even stronger price rises.\nChina\u2019s vast industrial sector has reported strong earnings growth this year thanks to a year-long construction boom that has fuelled demand and prices for building materials.\nBut government measures to tame rising housing prices and high debt levels are starting to weigh on property investment, while the boost from a massive infrastructure spree is starting to fade.\nBeijing\u2019s war on winter smog has also disrupted manufacturing activity.\nSome steel mills, smelters and factories in the north have been forced to curtail or halt production, though plants in other parts of the country may be ramping up production to fill the shortfall and gain more market share.\nDespite the pickups in output and new orders, however, the Caixin survey showed business confidence in the 12-month outlook remained weak by historical standards. Respondents cited forecasts of relatively subdued client demand and changes to national policies, though no more details were provided.\n\u201cManufacturing operating conditions improved in December, reinforcing the notion that economic growth has stabilized in 2017 and has even performed better than expected,\u201d Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the Caixin release.\n\u201dHowever, we should not underestimate downward pressure on growth due to tightening monetary policy and strengthening oversight on local government financing.\u201d\nAnalysts have widely expected China will report slightly cooler economic growth in the fourth quarter after a forecast-beating 6.9 percent expansion in the first nine months of the year, supported by the construction boom and robust exports.\nSources have told Reuters that Chinese leaders are likely to stick with a growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2018, the same as last year, even as they ratchet up efforts to prevent a destabilising build-up of debt.\nReporting by Lusha Zhang and Elias Glenn; Editing by Kim Coghill\n "}

(NASDAQ: RECN), a multinational business consulting firm, operating as Resources Global Professionals (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cRGP\u201d), today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended November 25, 2017.\nRevenue for the second quarter of 2018 was $156.7 million, up 6.2% year over year and 11.0% sequentially. Revenue in Europe improved for the eighth successive quarter, up 20.9% year over year excluding revenue from the Company\u2019s August 31, 2017 acquisition of taskforce-Management on Demand AG (\u201ctaskforce\u201d) and up 44.0% including taskforce. Revenue in the U.S. increased 1.5% year-over-year. The Company\u2019s Asia Pacific business rebounded from a disappointing first quarter, improving 12.1% sequentially, although slightly down year over year.\nNet income for the quarter was $8.1 million (5.2% of revenue), with an adjusted EBITDA* of $13.4 million (8.5% of revenue). Net income per diluted share was $0.27 for the second quarter of 2018, including $0.08 per diluted share related to the reversal of valuation allowances on international deferred tax assets, offset by costs of $0.06 per diluted share related to severance, acquisition, transformation and integration expenses during the quarter. The Company also paid a quarterly cash dividend on September 21, 2017 of $0.12 per share, resulting in a total dividend payment of $3.6 million.\n\u201cI am pleased with our performance this quarter and the continued progress we have made towards implementing our strategic initiatives,\u201d said Kate Duchene, President and Chief Executive Officer of RGP. \u201cOur international performance remains strong, and I am especially proud of our eighth successive quarter of revenue growth in Europe. Additionally, our performance in North America is strengthening, and we believe we can experience further growth in our third quarter as our core business continues to grow and we integrate our recent acquisition, Accretive, into RGP.\u201d\n*Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation.\nACQUISITIONS\nOn November 1, 2017, the Company announced it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume certain liabilities of Accretive Solutions, Inc. (\u201cAccretive\u201d) for $19.4 million in cash and 1,150,000 shares of Resources Connection, Inc. restricted common stock. Accretive is a professional services firm headquartered in Chicago with eight offices across the United States and approximately 500 professional staff. This acquisition supports our middle market growth strategy and offers strong capabilities in accounting and finance, enterprise governance, business technology and business transformation, in addition to providing a back office suite of services to startups through its Countsy brand. The acquisition closed on December 4, 2017. The Accretive transaction follows RGP\u2019s September 1, 2017 acquisition of taskforce, a German professional services firm that provides clients with senior interim management and project management expertise. RGP\u2019s consolidated financial results for the second quarter include taskforce revenue of approximately $3.7 million and EBITDA of $0.3 million.\nUPDATE ON STRATEGIC INITIATIVES\nRGP continues to make progress against its previously announced strategic initiatives. The Company has advanced its initiative to cultivate a more robust sales culture during the second quarter. The Company launched a new learning and development program to enhance training and accountability across the organization \u2013 including providing training on new management techniques and processes. RGP continued to roll out its new compensation programs to drive accountability and profitable growth. The Company\u2019s Strategic Client Program is performing well with revenue of this program up 8.0% since the beginning of the fiscal year, and is expected to deliver improved growth in fiscal year 2018. RGP expects to complete substantially all of its sales transformation by the end of the fiscal year.\nWith regard to the second initiative to redesign the Company\u2019s business model to enhance client offerings, the redesign is close to completion, with focus on building the Company\u2019s integrated solutions capabilities and delivering multi-disciplinary offerings to its clients in three areas of focus \u2013 Transaction Services, Technical Accounting Services, and Data & Analytics. In the second quarter, the Company implemented the new operating model for sales, talent and integrated solutions within RGP for all of North America.\nWith respect to the cost containment initiative, the Company continues its efforts to lower selling, general and administrative expenses (\u201cSG&A\u201d) as a percentage of revenue. The Company made progress this quarter and will continue to focus on improved leverage and cost synergies in the core business and with the Accretive acquisition. The Company remains committed to managing its cost structure to achieve improved SG&A performance as measured against revenue.\nFISCAL SECOND QUARTER REVIEW\nRevenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 6.2% (5.3% constant currency) to $ 156.7 million compared to $147.6 million in the prior year second quarter. Without taskforce\u2019s revenue of $3.7 million in the quarter, revenue was up 3.7%. On a sequential basis, second quarter revenue increased by 11.0% (10.6% constant currency) from $141.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Year over year constant currency results for international revenue are computed using the comparable second quarter fiscal 2017 conversion rates, and the sequential quarter constant currency international revenue is computed using the comparable first quarter fiscal 2018 conversion rates.\nRevenue in the U.S. increased by 1.5% year over year, reflecting increased activity and bill rates in several of the Company\u2019s largest markets. The company believes the increase in these markets is partially attributable to the Company\u2019s strategic initiatives, including its focus on improvement in bill rates per hour. U.S. revenue increased 5.6% sequentially. International revenue improved by 24.7% year over year (20.3% constant currency) and 32.9% sequentially (30.9% constant currency), reflecting strength in the Company\u2019s United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden practices. Revenue in Europe grew 20.9% year over year and 27.3% sequentially, excluding revenue attributable to the taskforce acquisition.\nNet income improved in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to $8.1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, including $0.08 per diluted share related to the reversal of valuation allowances on international deferred tax assets, offset by costs of $0.06 per diluted share related to severance, acquisition and transformation related expenses during the quarter; this compares to net income of $5.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in the prior year second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $13.4 million (8.5% of revenue) and $12.3 million (8.3% of revenue) for the quarter ended November 25, 2017 and November 26, 2016, respectively.\nGross margin was 37.9% in the second quar"}

(\"SEII\" or \"the Company\") (NASDAQ: SEII) today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sharing Economy Investment Limited (\"SEI\"), has entered into an exclusivity agreement with Quik Ventures, regarding a potential acquisition by SEI of not less than 51% of Quik Ventures.\nQuik Ventures develops and runs a sharing economy platform called Quikspaces ( www.quikspaces.com ), which is a platform allowing people to find flexible office space with their easy-to-use search and filter system. \"We came up with the idea when we were searching for affordable office space for ourselves, as we realized how antiquated the traditional leasing model is,\" said Jacky Lo, co-founder of Quik Ventures. \"Quikspaces offers a win-win solution for both sides, enabling those who sublet their unused space to significantly increase their income, while also allowing those who rent such spaces to do so at below average market rates. A sharing economy for office space is created by reallocating underutilized supply and matching it with demand, ensuring that no excess office space is wasted.\"\n\"We're moving away from traditional long leases into an economy where people want flexible office space that can be dynamically scaled according to business needs,\" says Quikspaces' Co-founder, Eunice Wong. \"While coworking spaces are great for collaboration, not all companies are suited for that type of open-layout environment which can be counterproductive. Flexible lease terms and affordable rent, on the other hand, are two key elements that all businesses look for. There is so much untapped supply out there in the market and valuable square footage is often locked up and underutilized. Quikspaces' aim is to empower business to monetize their unused office space.\"\n\"Quikspaces provides another workspace sharing option, a business model that our group firmly believes in,\" said Parkson Yip, COO of SEII. \"We are excited to add this new member to our workspace sharing solutions business, in addition to Anyworkspace in which we are acquiring a majority stake as well. Collaboration between these platforms within the group will provide us with more complete market coverage and more options in the workspace sharing market. Just in Hong Kong, Quikspaces already covers over 900 different sharing workspaces, ranging from an unutilized desk in an individual office to a fully equipped meeting room in a top-tier commercial building to an entire office suite available at flexible lease terms. Once acquired by the SEII group, workspace rental transactions will become easier, safer and more automated thanks to the implementation of our secure blockchain online payment system, along with features such as smart contract and Internet-of-Things facility access technologies which we already have in place or are currently developing.\n\"Our vision is to provide flexible workspaces everywhere around the world, so people can easily search, pay, gain access, work, and move on using fully automated, secure processes. Our productivity will no longer be bounded geographically, people can work anywhere and quickly complete their projects. Leveraging our blockchain-enabled technologies and the resources we are devoting to this exciting area, our group will further expand and cover other sharing economy solutions in different market segments. We continue to invite new venture ideas and entrepreneur partners to join SEII to build this new sharing economy ecosystem together. The SEII group has a strong belief that sharing economy and blockchain technologies will be key components to building a sustainable future, supporting the sustainable development goals which the United Nations has set up to reach by 2030.\"\nThere can be no assurances that the parties may enter into any agreement to do a transaction, and even if an agreement is entered into, there can be no assurances that such transaction will be consummated.\nAbout Sharing Economy International Inc.\nSharing Economy International Inc., through its affiliated companies, designs, manufactures and distributes a line of proprietary high and low temperature dyeing and finishing machinery to the textile industry. The Company's latest business initiatives are focused on targeting the technology and global sharing economy markets, by developing online platforms and rental business partnerships that will drive the global development of sharing through economical rental business models. Moreover, the Company will actively pursue blockchain technology in its existing and to-be-acquired business, enabling the general public to realize the beauty of resource sharing.\nAbout Quik Ventures\nQuik Ventures develops and operates the workspace sharing platform quikspaces.com , which is an online marketplace for flexible workspace rentals. The vision is to create a sharing economy for office space by eventually making all unused offices and conference spaces available online at any time. Users can search, review and book their coworking space serviced office or meeting room in a few simple clicks.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis release contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" relating to the business of the Company and its subsidiary and affiliated companies and certain potential transactions that they may enter into.

{"published":"2018-01-05T14:44:00.000+02:00","title":"Donald Trump Threat to Sue Steve Bannon Rings Hollow to Legal Experts | Fortune","text":"By Bloomberg 12:44 PM EST \nDonald Trump\u2019s unusual bid to muzzle his one-time top strategist is a flimsy legal gambit that could bring deeper complications for the president if he chooses to pursue it, according to legal experts. \nCharles Harder, a Trump attorney, sent cease-and-desist letters to Steve Bannon and the publisher of a new expose about the Trump White House. The publisher, Henry Holt, responded by moving up the publication date of \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\u201d by journalist Michael Wolff, to Friday. \nShould Trump follow through on his attorney\u2019s legal threats, he\u2019d have little chance of success in courts, according to legal experts, while opening himself to accusations of authoritarianism and disregard for the First Amendment. Any effort to push the matter to trial could backfire, they say \u2014 by potentially forcing Trump to produce documents or subject people in his circle to sworn depositions, and comproming an earlier argument that he\u2019s too busy being president to do battle in court. \nAnd if the president and his lawyers don\u2019t follow up on their attempt to hold Bannon accountable for a non-disparagement deal, they run another risk: Others who made similar pacts, and have tales to tell, may feel emboldened to go public. \nTrump\u2019s lawyers are attempting to hold Bannon to a non-disclosure agreement they say he signed with Trump and his presidential campaign that was, like those apparently entered into by other advisers, unusually broad. Harder wrote to Bannon late Wednesday reminding him he\u2019d agreed not to disclose confidential or disparaging information \u201cduring the term of your service and at all times thereafter.\u201d \nExperts say there are any number of reasons Trump would have a hard time prevailing in court. For starters, any agreement Trump had with Bannon would have effectively ended once both men became public officials, said Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit. \nTrump Attempt to Bully Bannon in Court Would Fail: Noah Feldman \n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any confidentiality agreements in the government and certainly not with an individual,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce someone becomes a government official he can\u2019t be bound by the agreement because Trump wasn\u2019t paying him. He\u2019s an employee of the U.S. government and is subject to the rules. The confidentiality agreement is only with Donald J. Trump the individual, but Bannon worked for the office of the president.\u201d \nAs hard as it might be to contain Bannon, stopping publication of a book by a journalist who talked to Bannon may be even more difficult. \n\u201cA non-disclosure or non-disparagement contract only binds the parties to the agreement, not others who obtain the information,\u201d said Jonathan Adler, a professor of law at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. \u201cIt\u2019s much harder to stop or punish third-party publication than it is to stop or punish a party to the agreement, and this obstacle is heightened given the clear public interest in matters relating to the conduct of a major political figure.\u201d \nThe Constitution would stand in the way as well, said Kathleen Clark, who teaches ethics in government at Washington University law school in St. Louis. \n\u201cOur First Amendment doctrine is quite clear that the courts will be of no help to try to attempt to prevent speech by a former government official,\u201d she said. \nNor is it likely Trump would prevail in a defamation case, said Samuel Estreicher, a New York University law school professor and director of its Center for Labor and Employment Law. Because Trump and his family members are considered public figures, under the law, he\u2019d have to prove the publisher put out the book in \u201cknowing or reckless disregard of the truth\u201d \u2014 a exceedingly high hurdle for the president, Estreicher said.

[The Cleveland Fed web site has a list of recommendations for which rules are worth following.]\n\"I am not advocating setting policy mechanically according to a simple policy rule; no rule works well enough across a variety of economic models and circumstances,\" Mester said, according to her prepared remarks. \"However, using the rules as reference points and discussing why our policy may differ from these policy descriptions could go some way in helping to explain our own policy reaction function to the public.\"\nThe suggestion came as part of a larger speech about how the Fed can communicate better with the public.\nParticularly during the period of extraordinary policy accommodation \u2014 low interest rates and $3.7 trillion of bond buying \u2014 the Fed sometimes has struggled to communicate its intentions. That has triggered an effort by some in Congress to audit the Fed, a practice that would force officials to disclose specifically why they made their decisions.\nMester went back even further than the crisis-era policy \u2014 to a speech that former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan made, after which The Wall Street Journal and New York Times reported conflicting takes on what the Fed \"maestro\" had said about rates.\n\"I suspect that monetary policy communication will likely always remain somewhat of a challenge, but over the past couple of decades, the FOMC has been taking significant steps on its journey toward increased transparency and better communication. It is important for the FOMC to continue on this journey because when the public has a better understanding of how monetary policy decisions are made, not only will the public have the information it needs to hold us accountable for our decisions but monetary policy itself will be more effective.\"\nThe debate about a rules-based approach has taken on greater prominence amid chatter that President Donald Trump was considering appointing John Taylor, a Stanford economist, as Fed chair. The nomination ultimately went to Jerome Powell .\nTaylor developed an eponymous rule that uses certain economic targets to determine where rates should be. The rule currently suggests the fed funds rate should be around 3.4 percent, instead of its target at 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent. Many Fed watchers see Taylor remaining as a viable candidate.\nIn addition to the rules-based approach, Mester also suggested the Fed not focus so much on short-term data changes in its economic projections, and tweaking those projections to link them to where each individual member believes the funds rate should be if those conditions come to fruition.\nWATCH: Mester not sure how tax reform will affect investment show chapters Fed's Loretta Mester: Don't know how tax reform will affect investment 7:50 PM ET Fri, 5 Jan 2018 | 04:14 Clarification: Mester advocates using rules for communication purposes to the public but not necessarily setting policy ."}

It could, however, ease tensions during the upcoming PyeongChang Winter Olympics in South Korea and reduce the chance of an escalation that might lead to a larger crisis, analysts said.\nIn a New Year's Day speech, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he was \"open to dialogue\" with Seoul and indicated that the North might send a \"delegation\" to the upcoming Winter Olympics, which begin Feb. 9.\nOn Tuesday, the Seoul government proposed talks could be held in the inter-Korean truce village of Panmunjom on Jan. 9, according to the Yonhap News Agency .\n\"We should take it seriously partly because he [Kim] is trying to drive a wedge between the United States and South Korea,\" said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear proliferation expert and professor of practice at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.\nSome experts believe the outreach from Pyongyang is ultimately an attempt to cause friction in the Seoul-Washington relationship and undermine sanctions, as well as to disrupt plans for the upcoming Foal Eagle and Key Resolve U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises.\nThe war games, which North Korea has seen over the years as a war rehearsal, involve navy ships, tanks and aircraft as well as live-fire exercises and tens of thousands of troops. They are scheduled to start in March.\nAFP | Getty Images North Korean soldiers stare at South Korean soldiers at the truce village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized zone (DMZ) dividing the two Koreas on November 27, 2017. \"What he's saying, in essence, is something some of us have been expecting for a while: 'I've got my deterrent now, so now I am prepared to talk,'\" said Bunn, who worked on nuclear issues in the Bill Clinton administration.\nMeantime, analysts say Kim's message to Washington about having the \"nuclear button\" on his desk should be viewed as a sign the regime won't give up its intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons. Some believe Kim, who turns 34 years old next week, could have assembly lines going for his new ICBMs this year.\nLate Tuesday, President Donald Trump tweeted he too has the nuclear button and said it happens to be \"much bigger and more powerful\" than one the North Korean leader has on his desk \u2014 and Trump boasted \"my Button works!\"\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/realDonaldTrump\/status\/948355557022420992\n\"Several times in Kim's speech he emphasized the fact that they are a strong nation because of nuclear weapons,\" said Lisa Collins, a fellow with the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a defense think tank. She said the North Korean leader's reference to the \"nuclear button\" shouldn't be viewed as a threat, but \"he's making very clear again that he will not be giving up his nuclear weapons.\"\nLast year, North Korea test-launched at least three ICBM missiles, including a Hwasong-15 in late November that some experts believe can reach all of the U.S. mainland. Also, the rogue nation conducted its sixth underground nuclear test in September and threatened to do an atmospheric nuclear blast but so far hasn't done so.\nOn Tuesday, NBC News Pentagon correspondent Hans Nichols reported that another missile launch by Pyongyang \"is possible, if not likely, in the coming days,\" citing several military officials.\nCollins said the data they've collected at CSIS shows that there's \"usually a downtick in missile testing in the winter months \u2014 November, December and January \u2014 and then usually in the early spring and summer is when there's an increase in North Korean missile tests. So I would anticipate the same pattern happening again this year in 2018 if there is no fundamental strategic change in the environment.\"\nThe Pentagon declined to comment.\nAnalysts say the fact Kim delivered the New Year's message in a Western-style suit rather than his usual Maoist attire may be an attempt to \"humanize him,\" especially to U.S. and Asian audiences. However, one U.S. expert believes that effort was a complete failure.\n\"Unfortunately, he came off looking more like a gangster than he did a sort of normal Westernized businessman or presidential leader,\" said Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest, a think tank founded by former President Richard Nixon.\nRegardless, Bunn said Kim probably wants to talk first with the South Koreans because \"he sees a more cooperative leader\" in Seoul than in Washington. He also believes \"it's an opportunity to reduce tensions on the peninsula, which were getting to the point where there was a real risk of inadvertently blundering into war.\"\nIn response to Monday's olive branch from Kim, South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, said he welcomed the news and possibility to turn the \"games into a groundbreaking chance to improve South-North relations and establish peace.\"\nAt the same time, South Korea's prime minister, Lee Nak-yon, was Quote: d as saying North Korea might now demand \"different treatment\" in discussions , Yonhap reported.\n\"Lee didn't elaborate on what 'different treatment' may mean, but it apparently indicates that the communist nation could demand the South treat it as a nuclear weapons-armed state,\" the South Korean news agency reported.\nTalks could involve a North Korean team participating in the upcoming PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games, which will be held about 50 miles from the border that divides the two Koreas.\n\"My question is what do the North Koreans want,\" said Kazianis. \"Every time North Korea comes to the table, they always want something for it.\"\nOne possibility is that North Korea may want the U.S. and South Korea to weaken sanctions, although that's unlikely to get any support from the Trump administration.\nIndeed, Trump on Tuesday morning tweeted: \"Sanctions and 'other' pressures are beginning to have a big impact on North Korea.\"\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/realDonaldTrump\/status\/948194400114487296\nUnited Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea are wide-ranging on trade and limit exports on such things as textiles, seafood and coal but also cut back oil and gasoline imports. Even so, Reuters last week reported that there have been at least three cases of Russian tankers in recent months transferring oil at sea for North Korea .\nKazianis said the South Koreans are \"in a bind with the Olympics. The North Koreans have a lot of ways to make the Olympics go very bad.\"\n\"So, I think Kim Jong Un probably realizes this and probably will go to the South Koreans on Jan. 9 and say, 'Look, I'm looking for sanctions relief or food aid or access to oil' or something like that,\" Kazianis said. \"The South Koreans might actually give it to him because they don't want to have billions of dollars in investment in the Winter Games be wrecked by, say, a North Korea nuclear test, an ICBM test or even some cyber-strikes.\"\nEven if Kim may appear to have the short-term leverage, though, experts say there are plenty of reasons to be wary.\n\"There's good reason to have skepticism about this offer by Kim Jong Un because of the timing,\""}

That's 66 percent more than the average spend by all Amazon customers, the report said.\n\"We've long thought that Amazon is keenly focused on building increasingly loyal and frequent shopping customers, and Echo seems to promote that goal,\" CIRP's cofounder Josh Lowitz said in the report.\nThe results, based on a survey of 2,000 US shoppers in the 12-month period ended September 2017, partly explains why Amazon is so focused on expanding its Echo user base. The e-commerce giant has been offering steep discounts for its Echo devices and has come up with an array of product options targeting different needs, including an Echo device with a screen.\nAmazon has never disclosed the exact sales figure for the Echo devices. This week, the company announced that it sold \"millions\" of Amazon devices, and that the Echo Dot device was the best selling product among Prime members. During the holidays, Amazon dropped the price of the Echo Dot to as little as $29.\n\"Based on the spending patterns of Echo owners, Amazon can certainly subsidize sales its Echo devices,\" Lowitz said in the report."}

Boxes containing aid from the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) are seen ahead of their transfer to the Gaza Strip, inside the Kerem Shalom border crossing terminal between Israel and Gaza Strip January 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Amir Cohen \nWhile saying the decision would sustain schools and health services, the U.S. official echoed U.S. President Donald Trump in calling on other nations to provide more funds because he believes the United States pays more than its share. \nThe decision to keep back some money is likely to compound the difficulty of reviving Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and to further undermine Arabs\u2019 faith that the United States can act as an impartial arbitrator, particularly following Trump\u2019s Dec. 6 announcement reversing decades of U.S. policy and recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. \nA Palestinian official quickly criticized Washington\u2019s decision to keep back some of the money and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was unaware of any change on aid but he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the possibility of a cut in funding. \nThe U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) that will receive the money needed to be fundamentally reevaluated \u201cin the way it operates and the way it is funded.\u201d \n\u201cWithout the funds we are providing today, UNRWA operations were at risk of running out of funds and closing down. The funds provided by the United States will prevent that from happening for the immediate future,\u201d the official said, saying the additional \u201c$65 million will be held for future consideration.\u201d \nIn a Twitter post on Jan. 2, Trump said that Washington gives the Palestinians \u201dHUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. \n\u201cThey don\u2019t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel ... with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?\u201d Trump added in his tweet. \nWhile the U.S. official did not link the U.S. decision to Trump\u2019s tweet, he made a point often advanced by the president by saying the United States had been UNRWA\u2019s single largest donor for decades and demanded other nations do more. \n\u201cIt is time other countries, some of them quite wealthy, step in and do their part to advance regional security and stability,\u201d the official said. \nTrump\u2019s aides initially debated whether to cut off all UNRWA aid after the tweet, a second U.S. official said. But those opposed to the idea argued that it could further destabilize the region, the official said. \n\u201cThis decision confirms the U.S administration is continuing in wiping out the rights of the Palestinian people,\u201d Palestine Liberation Organization official Wasel Abu Youssef told Reuters. \n\u201cFirst was declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and today the refugee issue,\u201d he said. \nHistorically, U.S. administrations had said the status of Jerusalem must be decided in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The city is holy to three major monotheistic faiths. \nAt the United Nations, Guterres told reporters that the services provided by UNRWA were \u201cof extreme importance, not only for the wellbeing of these populations ... but also in my opinion and an opinion that is shared by most international observers, including some Israeli ones, it is an important factor of stability.\u201d \n\u201cSo if UNRWA will not be in a position to provide the vital services and the emergency forms of support that UNRWA has been providing this will create a very, very serious problem and we will do everything we can to avoid this situation,\u201d he said.

Much of that research is being done at a research facility near Detroit.\nThe initiative comes at a time when several European countries, China and California have announced plans to ban the use, sale or production of vehicles with combustion engines under the hood. In Norway, that deadline is 2025 , while in many other areas the prohibition won't come until 2040.\nHowever, the internal combustion engine will continue to propel most of the world's vehicles for the foreseeable future, Saudi Aramco CTO Ahmad Al Khowaiter told CNBC on the sidelines of the Detroit Auto Show.\n\n\"Electric vehicles have a role to play, but we believe the most effective means to bring down emissions is to actually improve the efficiency of the internal combustion engine,\" he said.\nThe number of electric vehicles grew to about 2 million in 2016, a nearly 60 percent rise from the previous year, according to the International Energy Agency.\nBut that is still just 0.2 percent of all cars on the road, and hybrid-electric vehicles, which include gas engines, accounted for about 40 percent of all electric vehicles in 2016.\nStill, fuel efficiency standards are getting tougher around the world, said Khowaiter, who believes there are many opportunities to increase the combustion engine's efficiency.\nAramco has worked with European and American automakers to advance gasoline compression ignition, a technology that allows gas-powered engines to roughly match the efficiency of diesel engines.\nAsked whether he's worried about a U.S. ban on the internal combustion energy, Khowaiter said polices that attempt to pick winners are often counterproductive.\n\"We believe policy should be technology agnostic. Let the best technology win because that usually serves the best purpose for policy,\" he said.\nSaudi Aramco is planning to take a portion of the company public in what is widely expected to be the world's biggest ever share offering. The initial public offering is part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to create the world's largest sovereign wealth fund and diversify Saudi Arabia 's oil-dependent economy.\nKhowaiter declined to comment on the IPO."}

But now Amazon is asking the North American cities among the finalists to use a tactic more often associated with Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos: Secrecy. CNBC's Scott Cohn confirmed on Thursday that Amazon has insisted cities shift to a confidential pitch mode as the second round progresses. \nAt stake: a $5 billion facility that will employ 50,000 and boost state coffers by adding billions of dollars in additional investment in the surrounding community over the next 10 to 15 years. \nMayors across North America are choosing their words carefully. \n\"It's like a poker game,\" Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings told CNBC at the United States Conference of Mayors on Thursday, explaining that it's time for cities to play their cards close to the vest. \"Bring the bidding war on,\" he said. \nJust not in public. \nThe full list of 20 finalists includes some of the most competitive cities in the world and data compiled by CNBC bears that out. \n\"We aren't gonna really talk about what's on the table,\" said Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Browser. \n\"It's a very secretive process. We're obviously bound by confidentiality,\" said Miami Mayor Francis Suarez. \n\"If I were to lay out out now what we'll offer it would be criticized and looked at, and determined whether it's good or bad,\" said Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney. But Philly's mayor did provide a little color. \"We have people saying we don't want Amazon because housing prices will go up or it will be too crowded. These are problems we'd love to manage.\" Getty Images Jeff Bezos \nThe trash talking may be over, but some of the incentives already offered are eye-opening: $7 billion from New Jersey (where Newark is a finalist), and potentially $5 billion from Maryland. \nBoston Mayor Marty Walsh said it was too early to discuss incentives because Amazon has not yet made clear its expectations. \nSome mayors were more willing than others to give limited pitches in response to CNBC questions at the annual mayors conference. \nDallas Mayor Rawlings was one. Among his points: \nDallas has been growing faster than any city in the country and fast growth is a factor that both it and Amazon share. \"Nobody has grown faster or created more jobs than us,\" he said. \nRawlings also attempted to dispel a few myths. While Austin gets all the tech credit, Dallas has more tech employees \u2014 almost as many as in Seattle. And while Rawlings acknowledged the broader Texas \"red state\" reputation is an issue, especially given the tech industry's focus on social tolerance, he stressed that Dallas is \"a blue city in a red state,\" which has scored 100 on the LGBT Index for the past three years. \"There are concerns at the state level, but we are working through that,\" he said. \nDallas seems to think a factor that has often helped its state in CNBC's Annual Top States for Business ranking will help here too: it will be less expensive for Amazon on multiple fronts. Cheaper to build, lower cost of business, and lower cost of living, Rawlings said. And he made that pitch to Amazon shareholders. \n\"Shareholders will win,\" Rawlings said. \nHe also highlighted Dallas central placement in the country allowing roundtrip flights to both coasts. And the real winner is ... \nSome outside observers insist that whether shouting from the hills or keeping as quiet as possible, cities aren't going to end up as the real winner. \n\"Amazon has algorithms and crawlers that go out and find the lowest prices and create this giant sucking sound, and they've taken it offline and effectively created a transfer in value from taxpayers to Amazon,\" said Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business told CNBC on Thursday. \"It's a 'Hunger Games' environment to mature the best term sheet possible and ask a mayor to match, which will be irresistible,\" Galloway said. He added, \"Amazon is genius in occupying the front page, but this is, simply put, an incredibly deft calculation to extract several pounds of flesh.\" \nMany of the finalists were thought to be contenders from the start. They include cities CNBC has already visited as we evaluate the bids: Chicago, Columbus, Ohio; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Denver. But three dark horse candidates joined the list: Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and Toronto. The list includes three locations in and around the nation's capital: Washington, D.C.; the Northern Virginia suburbs, and Montgomery County, Maryland. The area was already receiving buzz based on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' ownership of the Washington Post. \nOne important aspect of the secretive process that not even any of the mayors seem to understand: How long the decision will take for Amazon to make, and whether there will be another round of cuts before the winner is named. Mayors told CNBC's Scott Cohn at the conference that the decision could come by spring or not before next year. And while there are some expectations the list will get whittled down further, mayors don't know if that will be another round in the public process, or if the next words from Amazon will be, \"And the winner is ...\" CNBC ratings on the cities City, State "}

FILE PHOTO - Britain's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire arrives in Downing Street, London, November 21, 2017.

It\u2019s not known whether criminals have been able to carry out such attacks as neither Meltdown nor Spectre leave any traces in log files. \nIntel says it has started providing software and firmware updates to mitigate the security issues. ARM has also said it was working with AMD and Intel on security fixes. FINDING A FIX \nThe discovery was originally reported by online tech journal The Register. As a result of that report, research on the defect was published a week earlier than the manufacturers had planned, before some had time to work out a complete fix. \nThe Graz team had already been working on a tool to defend against attempts to steal secrets from kernel memory. Jokingly, they at first nicknamed the app Forcefully Unmap Complete Kernel With Interrupt Trampolines - or FUCKWIT for short. \nBy the time they presented a paper last June, they had renamed it KAISER, or Kernel Address Isolation to have Side-channels Effectively Removed. That was another pun - the German word Kaiser means emperor. \nAs the name suggests, KAISER seeks to defend the kernel memory from a so-called side-channel attack that exploits a design feature of modern processors that increases their speed. \nThis involves processors executing tasks \u201cout-of-order\u201d, and not in the sequence received. If the CPU makes the right speculative call, time is saved. Get it wrong and the out-of-order task is cancelled and no time is lost. \nReviewing the KAISER paper, researcher Anders Fogh wrote in a blog last July that it might be possible to abuse so-called speculative execution in order to read kernel memory. He was not able to do so in practice, however. ( bit.ly\/2vpkut0 ) RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE \nOnly after the December self-hacking episode did the significance of Graz team\u2019s earlier work become clear. It turned out that the KAISER tool presented an effective defence against Meltdown. \nThe team quickly got in touch with Intel and learned that other researchers - inspired in part by Fogh\u2019s blog - had made similar discoveries. \nThey were working under so-called responsible disclosure, where researchers inform affected companies of their findings to give them time to prepare \u2018patches\u2019 to repair flaws they have exposed. \nThe key players were independent researcher Paul Kocher and the team at a company called Cyberus Technology, said Gruss, while Jann Horn at Google Project Zero came to similar conclusions independently. \n\"We merged our efforts in mid-December with the team around Paul Kocher and the people from Cyberus Technology to work on two solid publications on Meltdown and Spectre,\" said Gruss. ( www.meltdownattack.com ) \nGruss had not even been aware of the work Horn was doing. ( here ) \n\u201cJann Horn developed all of this independently - that\u2019s incredibly impressive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe developed very similar attacks, but we were a team of 10 researchers.\u201d \nThe wider team said patches for Meltdown, based on KAISER, had been readied for Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc operating systems, as well as for the Linux open-source system. \nThere is as yet no fix for Spectre, which tricks programmes into leaking their secrets but is viewed as a harder exploit for a hacker to carry out. \nAsked which of the two flaws posed the greater challenge, Gruss said: \u201dThe immediate problem is Meltdown. \n\u201cAfter that it is going to be Spectre. Spectre is more difficult to exploit but also to mitigate. So in the long run I\u2019d bet on Spectre.\u201d Editing by Georgina Prodhan and Edmund Blair"}

The man, disguised as a policeman, killed 69 people and severely wounded 33. Many of the 358 survivors saw what happened and risked hypothermia and drowning trying to escape. Most lost friends. \nThe survivors have been part of several studies to understand how terror and trauma affect adolescents. In this study, published in the journal Neurology, Stensland and colleagues looked at recurrent migraines and tension-type headaches in 213 of the survivors, ages 13 to 20. Trained personnel interviewed the survivors about four months after the attack, again 18 months afterward, and again three years after the attack. \nThe research team found the terror attack survivors reported many recurring tension-type headaches and migraines, and headaches were generally more common in girls. In particular, the female survivors reported three times more weekly or daily headaches than similar young women in the general population in Norway. \nPosttraumatic psychological distress levels were much higher, too. \n\u201cWe were surprised . . . the link was so strong between terror and headaches, even though we accounted for (many other factors),\u201d Stensland said. \nFuture studies will continue to observe the physical and psychological symptoms that these teens experience. \n\u201cIncidents of terror are unfortunately commonplace worldwide, and although the physical effects are well covered, the invisible scars of psychological trauma receive much less attention,\u201d said Dr. Gretchen Tietjen, director of The Headache Treatment and Research Program at the University of Toledo, Ohio, who wasn\u2019t involved with this study. \n\u201cPsychological trauma during critical periods of development affects the brain in ways that alter not only the psyche, but also the metabolic, immune, endocrine and nervous systems,\u201d she told Reuters Health by email. \u201cThese changes lead to increased susceptibility to a wide variety of adult diseases that may even be passed on to the next generation.\u201d \nThese associations extend beyond terror events to childhood maltreatment, emotional abuse and sexual violence, Stensland added. Abuse in peer relationships or social media bullying can have a similar effect. \n\u201cThey\u2019re keeping a secret and don\u2019t want others to know what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for people to know that an increase in headaches could indicate something has happened, and it\u2019s time to talk.\u201d \nStensland would also like to see research on medication and overuse of painkillers. Teens may be able to treat their headaches with over-the-counter medicine, but that doesn\u2019t treat the underlying issues related to the traumatic event, she noted. \n\u201cAdolescents medicate themselves, and few go to the doctor, but if you keep medicating like that, it may actually contribute to the chronic behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cSeek help early. That\u2019s the key.\u201d \nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2A7OdFS Neurology, online December 13, 2017."}

Short positions on Pendragon have nearly trebled since the end of November, according to the FCA. UNSUSTAINABLE BOOM? \nAnother factor latched upon by the short-sellers is the threat to car finance packages that, thanks to a decade of cheap credit, now account for nearly 90 percent of new car purchases \u2013 nearly double the figure in 2006. \nUnder one of the most popular financing options, known as \u201cpersonal contract plans\u201d (PCPs), customers pay a small deposit to lease a car, making lower monthly payments than under a traditional hire-purchase scheme, with the option to return the car at the end of the contract. \nThe risk is that oversupply of used cars in the UK is about to hit the resale prices of cars on which PCP rates are partly based. PCP repayment rates would rise, further choking off demand for new vehicles and hitting dealer profit margins, which can already be as narrow as 2 percent. \nLookers and Pendragon derive the vast majority of their profits from the UK and Ireland, making them more exposed to a British downturn than the more geographically diverse auto manufacturers. \n\u201cPCPs have been a big driver in pushing up the average price of a car,\u201d Trium Capital\u2019s Grewal said. \u201cIt allows you to afford a more expensive model.\u201d \nLast month analysts at JP Morgan warned clients that PCPs had resulted in \u201cunsustainably high volumes of premium vehicle sales\u201d. \nFor the graphic 'Car dealers are suffering from falling sales', click - reut.rs\/2CYVeMx Reporting by Alasdair Pal; Editing by Tom Pfeiffer and David Goodman"}

Construction on its first U.S.-based terminal is slated to begin in 2019. \nBut Souki, one of the few executives in the space who called both the collapse and recovery in oil prices, said infrastructure was proving to be a bigger hurdle than many people think. \n\"We had very low prices for three years and therefore all the producers are now not very financially stable so they cannot invest.

Tehran has always denied seeking nuclear arms. \n\u201cThe aim is to send a message to Washington that Iran is complying and that it is better to have the nuclear agreement than to isolate Tehran,\u201d one diplomat said. \nA spokesman for Iran\u2019s atomic energy agency said on Wednesday that a reimposition of sanctions by the United States would be a violation of the nuclear deal and added that the Islamic Republic had the capacity to greatly increase its enrichment of uranium. \nThe foreign ministers of Britain, Germany, France as well as Iran\u2019s Mohammad Javad Zarif, are expected to meet on Thursday morning with Mogherini, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief. \nTrump\u2019s October decision not to certify that Tehran is meeting the terms of a pact to stop it developing nuclear weapons went against world powers China, Russia, Europe and members of the U.S. Congress. \nThe Thursday meeting in Brussels is part of diplomacy on both sides of the Atlantic before deadlines related to the deal falling this month, including deciding whether to reimpose oil sanctions lifted under the deal. \nTrump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil exports under the terms of the pact. The State Department said on Tuesday the Trump administration was expected to decide on Friday. \nThe decision comes as Iran\u2019s government deals with protests over economic hardships and corruption that are linked to frustration among younger Iranians who hoped to see more benefits from the lifting of sanctions. \nRetired U.S. military officers, members of the U.S. Congress and former U.S. ambassadors were among 52 U.S. national security experts who signed a letter released on Monday urging Trump not to jeopardize the deal with Iran. \nEuropean countries including France and Italy have benefited from renewed trade with Iran, whose proven natural gas reserves are as vast as Russia\u2018s, while Britain reopened its embassy in Tehran following the deal. \nIf Trump reimposes sanctions on Tehran, European powers fear the deal would fall apart. The EU is adamant the deal cannot be renegotiated. Reporting by Robin Emmott and John Irish; Editing by Richard Balmforth"}

The 30-year-old Hollywood screenwriter graduated from Barnard College in May 2009 and found early success as a writer's assistant on the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards and a member of the Fox Writers Initiative. \nYet Suh says she spent the better part of her 20s being a perfectionist, avoiding risks and listening to \"self-sabotaging, patriarchal\" thoughts that kept her from reaching her full potential. \"DIY Rules for a WTF World\" is the culmination of advice Suh gave herself and to friends over a decade to \"be productive and happy.\" A post shared by Krista Suh (@kristasuh) on Jan 7, 2018 at 8:05am PST \n\"My hope is that women and women's rights supporters can read this book and have the confidence to pursue whatever ambitious idea they have in their heart. It doesn't have to be a craftivist project like the Pussyhat Project, but my goal is to empower the next wave of activists and leaders,\" Suh says. \nBased on her new book and an interview with CNBC Make It, here are three of Suh's career tips for success. 1. It's okay to be a beginner \nWhen Suh first got the idea to knit the pussy hat, knitting had barely just become an obsession for her. As she made plans to visit Washington D.C. for the Women's March, she figured she would need a hat to keep her warm. \nAs a beginner knitter, Suh thought to herself, \"If I can knit this hat, anyone can.\" She envisioned an ocean of pink hat-wearers and turned her DIY-hat into a community art project. A post shared by Krista Suh (@kristasuh) on Dec 10, 2016 at 10:28am PST \n\"If I hadn't shifted my focus away from being perfect at the very beginning of something new, I would never have done the Pussyhat Project,\" Suh writes in her book. \"I would have allowed perfectionism to get in my own way.\" \nAhead of the 2017 march, the pussy hat knitting pattern had been downloaded over 60,000 times from her website and hundreds of sellers on Etsy and Amazon sold the hats ready to wear. \n\"Oftentimes, leaders are afraid to be beginners and find 'training wheels' \u2014 like taking a class or hiring a teacher to learn new skills \u2014 too babyish,\" Suh says. \"But I would argue that the people who succeed the most are the ones who aren't afraid of looking foolish and practicing on training wheels.\" 2. Focus your goals \nThe idea for a Women's March surfaced immediately after Trump's election on November 8, 2016, as marginalized communities across the country felt unsettled, Terry Stein reported in the Washington Post in 2017. \nBy the time Suh and Zweiman came up with the idea of sharing the pussy hat with other women's rights supporters, plans to follow through with the march were in full effect. So they decided to focus their efforts on an area that seemingly no one else had yet covered: creating a way for anyone, anywhere to participate in the march. Nicole Mabry | Getty Images Prostesters march in Washington D.C. to raise awareness for women's rights on January 21, 2017. \n\"There were already geniuses at work doing the planning of the march, so how could I use my skills in an area that needed some magic?\" Suh writes in her book. \nAfter sustaining a life-altering head and neck injury in years prior, Zweiman could not physically make her way to the Women's March in Washington, D.C. Still able to knit, Zweiman focused on her craft and contributed to the iconic tide of pink hats. \n\"While we welcomed people to make hats for their local marches, we all put efforts into getting hats to the Washington D.C. march,\" Suh says. \n\"I focused just on the hats for the march, not the organization of the whole march or the route,\" Suh adds. \"Focusing on one great detail can help you create the biggest impact and it frees up time for you to up your self-care and to have fun.\" 3. Figure out when you do your best work \nUnderstanding the rhythms of your body and mind are crucial to knowing when you are most likely to be more or less productive, Suh says. She calls this process \"inhaling\" and \"exhaling.\" \nWhen you inhale, you are taking in new experiences, saying yes to opportunities and exploring your interests. When you exhale, you enter a time of intense focus, digest what you have learned and making your vision a reality. \nFor Suh, the summer of 2016 was an inhaling period when she explored knitting. \n\"At the time, a lot of my relatives judged me because it appeared that I wasn't working or doing anything significant and fruitful,\" she writes. \"Had I not spent that time inhaling, I would not have been able to exhale the Pussyhat Project in the fall.\" \nThe key to leveraging your natural rhythm, she says, is recognizing you don't have control over which stage you are in, but you can learn how to make the most of each one. \n\"A lot of times, our discomfort in life comes from either needlessly questioning the stage of life were are in or staying in a stage too long out of fear of change,\" Suh writes. \"If I simply noted and accepted I was in an inhale stage rather than beating myself up over being so unfocused, I might have made progress and met my goals more quickly.\""}

Some suspects will face trial if they do not settle. \nIn late November, senior Saudi Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, once seen as a leading contender to the throne, was freed after reaching a settlement with authorities that involved paying more than $1 billion, according to a Saudi official. \nOne top businessman who is still being held is billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman and owner of global investment firm Kingdom Holding.

Stiff breezes were expected to create dangerously cold wind chills across southeastern Georgia and most of northeastern Florida, the weather service said. \nMichael Kimberl, co-founder of Sean\u2019s Outpost, an encampment for homeless people in Pensacola, Florida, said he was handing out propane fuel and extra blankets to residents. \n\u201cOur community is very unequipped for weather of this type,\u201d he said by phone. Homeless shelters were also making special accommodations, including one site available for women and children, he said. \nThe mass of frigid air pumped south by a dip in the jet stream sent temperatures plunging across the U.S. heartland. Omaha, Nebraska, posted a low of minus 20 F (minus 29 C), breaking a 130-year-old record, and Aberdeen, South Dakota, shattered a record set in 1919 with a temperature of minus 32 F (minus 36 C). \nThe cold will be unrelenting across the Middle Atlantic and Northeastern United States, with up to two dozen low-temperature records expected in those regions over the next day or two, Hurley said. \nAlthough the cold should ease across most of the United States after Tuesday, the northeastern quarter of the country will see a repeat of the frigid temperatures from Thursday to Friday as another arctic blast hits the area. \nThe private AccuWeather forecaster said the cold snap could combine with a storm brewing off the Bahamas to bring snow and high winds to much of the Eastern Seaboard as it heads north on Wednesday and Thursday. \nThe only part of the United States spared the deep freeze is the Southwest, with above-normal temperatures and dry weather expected to linger there, the weather service said.

Although Check Point routinely notifies the search giant of malicious apps it discovers on the Google Play store in private, it will publicly reveal more egregious forms of malware that the company believes warrants more attention, he explained. \nPadon estimates that the malware, called LightsOut because if affects several flashlight apps, has been downloaded between 1.5 million to 7.5 million times. He based those numbers on publicly available download estimates from Google Play on each of the 22 different affected apps. \nTo trick people into installing the shady software, hackers gave the apps legitimate sounding names like \u201cVoice Recorder Pro,\u201d \u201cWiFi Password Pro,\u201d \u201cSuper Flashlight Lite,\u201d and \u201cBrightest LED Flashlight-Pro.\u201d \nOnce downloaded and opened by users, the apps display a \u201csettings\u201d screen in which people can choose for the software to display online advertising. But this choice is merely an illusion, since the apps can be controlled from outside servers to display unwanted ads, Padon said. \nThe deceiving apps then disappear from people\u2019s home screens, making them hard to remove for those without technical skills. \n\u201cMy mother was infected by a similar adware once,\u201d Padon recalled of older phony phantom apps. \u201cShe didn\u2019t understand how to remove it in the first place.\u201d \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. \nA number of actions can cause unwanted ads to display on screens, including ending a phone call, locking the screen, or even plugging in a phone charger. \nAlthough the malware does not represent a \u201csignificant step forward\u201d in technical complexity, it highlights \u201canother step in the way adware manages to infiltrate Google Play,\u201d said Padon. \nLightsOut shows that hackers \u201care becoming more sophisticated in the way they are managing to bypass Google Plays\u2019 detections and continue to serve fraudulent ads,\u201d he said. \nPadon praised Google\u2019s (goog) overall security efforts in filtering shady apps from Google Play, especially so-called ransomware , in which the apps, once downloaded, can immediately block people from accessing their smartphone or scramble their documents unless they pay up. \nWhat Google struggles in, however, is discovering apps that perform covert tasks over a period of time in order to remain undetected instead of immediately engaging in fraud or other nefarious activities. And hackers are increasingly distributing malicious apps in the Google Play store, Padon said. \nBased on Check Point\u2019s research, and not counting similar efforts by other security vendors , Padon estimates that from 2016 through 2017, the amount of malware downloads \u201cat the very least doubled\u201d on Google Play. In 2017, Check Point estimated between 35.5 and 106 million malicious app downloads from Google Play, compared to 15.5 to 20.5 million malicious app downloads in 2016. \n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that these numbers refer only to malware first discovered by Check Point, and do not include all malware we\u2019ve detected, or malware detected by other vendors, so the total numbers probably exceed this by far,\u201d he later added in an email. \nPadon recommends that Android phone users install some form of security software on their smartphones that can screen for bad apps. People should generally avoid installing flashlight apps too, because they appear to be a common way that hackers routinely spread malware . \n\u201cI can\u2019t really think of a good reason to install a flashlight app, but people continue to do so,\u201d said Padon. \u201cIt is the clich\u00e9 that keeps on giving.\u201d SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

REUTERS. In June that year as Iranians seethed across the nation, a video showing protester Neda Agha-Soltan\u2019s last moments after being shot in the chest made her an icon of the opposition movement.\nThis time, Iranian moderates are appealing for caution even though some hardliners are calling for an iron fist to crush one of the gravest threats to Iran\u2019s clerical leaders, who came to power in the 1979 Islamic revolution.\nThose divisions are making it hard for the authorities to defuse spontaneous demonstration, especially as there are no apparent protest leaders who can be identified and rounded up.\nVideos on the internet showed the difficulties the Iranian authorities are facing in controlling the protests, in contrast to 2009 when the opposition had a clear hierarchy.\nFootage carried on several semi-official websites showed men in white hooded coats who were described as the protest leaders. Red arrows on the screen identified them as they led attacks on police and buildings.\nIn 2009, the \u201cGreen Movement\u201d accused of stoking months of mass protests had two clear figureheads. Both have been under house arrest since 2011 though neither has been formally charged or appeared in court.\nTEN KILLED The latest unrest began on Thursday when hundreds of people took to the streets of Iran\u2019s second city Mashhad to protest against economic hardships and alleged corruption.\nBut in a rare political challenge, they were soon calling for clerical leaders including the ultimate authority in Iran\u2019s cumbersome system of dual clerical and republican rule - Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - to step down.\nSince Thursday, tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets across Iran, alarming the government and the clerical leadership.\nTen people were killed during protests on Sunday, state television reported, as unsigned statements posted on social media sites called for new demonstrations in the capital Tehran and 50 other cities.\nIn a ratcheting up of tensions, protesters tried to take over some military bases and police stations but were pushed back by security forces, state TV said without elaborating.\nPresident Hassan Rouhani struck a conciliatory tone as demonstrators widened their targets from police vehicles and banks to seminaries in a direct challenge to the country\u2019s religious establishment.\n\u201cWhat has happened in the past few days may appear as a threat but we have to turn it into an opportunity and see what the problem is,\u201d ISNA news agency Quote: d Rouhani as saying on Sunday.\nHe even contradicted the usual conspiracy theories that blame Western powers and Israel for Iran\u2019s woes, stressing the need to get to the root causes of the problem.\n\u201cAll these people are not getting orders from abroad, and some have gone out to the streets because of their feelings and problems,\u201d he said.\nLawmaker Jorjik Abramian was also measured in his response to growing frustrations with unemployment that hit 28.8 percent last year and alleged graft that prompted some Iranians to describe their government as thieves.\n\u201cThe recent events are due to an accumulation of people\u2019s demands that have been ignored,\u201d ILNA news agency Quote: d him as saying. \u201cWe must restore the trust of the people in the authorities. If this happens, no foreign agent can carry out his aims in the country.\u201d\nThe 2009 protests following the disputed re-election of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad were eventually crushed by the state security apparatus, headed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its affiliated Basij militia volunteers.\nILNA said Abramian warned against any \u201crepeat of Kahrizak\u201d -a reference to an infamous detention centre outside Tehran where three detainees were killed and many tortured in 2009, according to human rights campaigners.\nAVOIDING FLASHPOINTS Protesters, for their part, also don\u2019t seem to have a clear plan, other than defying the security forces and even the elite Revolutionary Guards.\nThe security forces may be showing restraint this time to avoid bloodshed that could galvanise and embolden protesters. But that has not stopped leading conservatives calling for tough measures.\n\u201cThose who commit sabotage and spread unrest should be dealt with and dealt with firmly,\u201d judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani said in remarks carried on state television.\nWith few options at hand, some Iranian leaders lashed out again at the United States. A top military official said support for the protesters expressed by U.S. President Trump and other U.S. officials showed Washington had ulterior motives.\n\u201cThe involvement of top U.S. leaders along with other states and media outlets ... suggest that America is planning to launch a new sedition in Iran,\u201d armed forces spokesman Masoud Jazayeri, who is also a Revolutionary Guards commander, was Quote: d as saying by the state broadcaster IRIB\u2019s website.\nBut that has failed so far to divert the attention of Iranians away from their problems at home.\nIran\u2019s leaders believe they can count on support from many of the generation that took part in the 1979 revolution because of their ideological commitment and the economic gains they have made under the Islamic government, analysts say.\nBut the growing number of youths taking to the streets suggests the old guard may have to compromise and give in to some of their demands, analysts say.\nReporting by Dubai newsroom; editing by David Clarke\n "}

The fate of the remaining 31 sailors is not known. \nThe Sanchi tanker (IMO:9356608) run by Iran\u2019s top oil shipping operator, National Iranian Tanker Co, collided with the CF Crystal (IMO:9497050) on Saturday evening about 160 nautical miles off China\u2019s coast near Shanghai and the mouth of the Yangtze River Delta. \nChinese state media CCTV showed footage on Monday of a flotilla of boats dousing the flames with water as plumes of thick dark smoke continued to billow from the tanker. \nOne portion appeared to show the fire had been extinguished, although this could not be independently confirmed. China\u2019s Ministry of Transport and Maritime Safety would not comment when asked if the fire was out. \n\u201cThe Chinese government takes maritime accidents like this very seriously, and has already dispatched many search and rescue teams to the scene to carry out search and rescue,\u201d said the foreign ministry\u2019s Lu said. \nChina sent four rescue ships and three cleaning boats to the site, South Korea dispatched a ship and a helicopter, while a U.S. Navy military aircraft searched an area of about 3,600 square nautical miles (12,350 sq km) for crew members. \nThe Panama-registered tanker was sailing from Iran to South Korea, carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate, an ultra-light and highly volatile crude. That is equivalent to just under 1 million barrels, worth about $60 million, based on global crude oil prices. \nShip tracking data shows the collision occurred in waters not frequently used by large vessels like tankers, dry-bulk carriers or container ships. Most ships travel either closer to the Chinese coast in the west or more nearby to Japan in the east. \nThe freight ship, which was carrying U.S. grain, suffered limited damage and the 21 crew members, all Chinese nationals, were rescued. \nChina\u2019s transport ministry said the CF Crystal were being taken to the port of Luhuashan, just south of Shanghai, where authorities will start an investigation into the cause of the incident. \n(For a graphic on ship collision off China's coast click tmsnrt.rs\/2CBgqai ) COLORLESS, ODORLESS AND HARMFUL \nLu said it was too soon to discuss how victims of the disaster may be compensated, and that compensation and other questions would be addressed after an investigation into the accident is complete. \nBad weather made it hard for the rescue crews to get access to the tanker, but toxic gas from the burning oil posed a major risk. \nWhen condensate meets water, it evaporates quickly and can cause large-scale explosion as it reacts with air and turns into a flammable gas, the transportation ministry said on Monday. \nTrying to contain a spill of condensate, which is extremely low in density, highly toxic and much more explosive than normal crude oil, may be difficult. \nWhen liquid, most condensate is colorless and virtually odorless. Surface spills of condensate are therefore difficult to detect visually, making them hard to manage and contain. \nTankers also carry shipping fuel, known as bunker, which is extremely heavy and toxic when spilled, though much less explosive. \nThe Shanghai Maritime Bureau\u2019s navigation department said the collision did not affect traffic in and out of Shanghai, one of the world\u2019s busiest and biggest ports, or ports along the Yangtze river. \nA spokesman for South Korea\u2019s Hanwha Total Petrochemical Co Ltd [SMCHE.UL], which was due to receive the cargo, said it would use its own stockpiles to replace the lost cargo.

{"published":"2018-01-04T01:07:00.000+02:00","title":"UPDATE 3-Tesla pushes back Model 3 production target again, despite progress","text":"(Adds analyst quotes, background)\nSAN FRANCISCO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc delayed a production target for its new Model 3 sedan for the second time on Wednesday, disappointing investors even as it claimed \"major progress\" overcoming manufacturing challenges that have hampered the vehicle's rollout.\nThe electric vehicle maker headed by Elon Musk said it would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised. Instead, Tesla said it now plans to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter.\nThe delay sent shares of the Palo Alto, California-based company down 2 percent in after-market trading.\nThe Model 3 is critical to Tesla's long-term success, as it is the most affordable of its cars to date and is the only one capable of transforming the niche automaker to a mass producer amid a sea of rivals entering the nascent electric vehicle market.\nBuilding the car efficiently and delivering it without delays to customers is also critical, as the money-losing company faces high cash burn. Delays increase the risk that reservation-holders will cancel orders.\n\"The further delay to (production volume) will leave analysts and investors focused on the implications for cash as we head through the first half of the year, Evercore analyst George Galliers told Reuters.\nThe company burned through $1.1 billion in capital expenditures in its third quarter and said in November that fourth-quarter capex would also be about $1.1 billion.\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note that he did not believe Tesla will be required to do a capital raise.\n\"We have them hovering about $1 billion in cash ... They don't have a ton of wiggle room though in our view,\" Spak said.\nIn delivering 1,550 of its new Model 3 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, Tesla fell short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts had expected 4,100 Model 3 sedans to be delivered in the fourth quarter, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.\nThe estimates for Model 3 deliveries by different brokerages varied widely. While Evercore analysts estimated 5,800 deliveries, Cowen analysts expected just 2,250.\nTesla said 860 Model 3 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the fourth quarter.\nThe company said it delivered a total of 29,870 vehicles in the fourth quarter, including 15,200 Model S vehicles and 13,120 Model X cars. Analysts had expected total deliveries of about 30,000.\nPRODUCTION ACCELERATING\nTesla had initially predicted to reach the milestone of 5,000 vehicles per week in December, but in November deferred the target to the end of the first quarter.\nTesla said on Wednesday its production rate had increased significantly despite the delays.\n\"In the last seven working days of the quarter, we made 793 Model 3s, and in the last few days, we hit a production rate on each of our manufacturing lines that extrapolates to over 1,000 Model 3s per week,\" the company said in a statement.\nThat pace of production is still below that of many carmakers. A conventional car factory operating at full speed on two shifts can churn out nearly 1,000 vehicles a day.\nThe Model 3 - which starts at $35,000, or about half the price of its flagship Model S - was met with great enthusiasm when its prototype was first unveiled in early 2016. Tesla said in August it had about 500,000 reservations for the car and demand was not a constraint.\nProduction, however, hit snags during a period of \"manufacturing hell\" Musk first warned of in July. Among the issues Tesla faced was its battery module assembly line at its Nevada Gigafactory, which required a redesign.\nIn its third quarter, Tesla built just 260 Model 3s.\nAlthough bullish investors have generally waved off early Model 3 problems, instead focusing on the future prospects of Tesla, critics warn that Model 3 issues could sour demand for Tesla's mass-market vehicle, delay sorely needed revenue and compromise the company's ability to raise cash in the future.\nTesla shares, despite paring some gains from a high of $385 in September, still trade at 46 percent above their price a year ago.

Last year, the shipments averaged 130,000 bpd, according to U.S. government data. \nCanadian crudes have been replacing heavy oil from Venezuela and Mexico at the Gulf Coast, due to production declines in both countries. \n\u201cCanadian barrels are a great fit for Gulf Coast refiners right now. It\u2019s just a matter of getting those barrels down here,\u201d said a Gulf Coast trader. \nWestern Canada Select for February delivery traded Thursday at $25.05 per barrel below West Texas Intermediate, the widest since December 2014. Including transportation costs of between $11 and $14 a barrel to ship the crude by rail to the Gulf Coast, it is affordable to more refiners, said analysts and traders. \n\u201cBased on where the differentials are today, as an oil producer, you\u2019re incentivized to ship product by rail to the Gulf Coast,\u201d said Matt Murphy, a Tudor Pickering researcher. \nThe current differential is driven in part by increased supplies. Canadian crude oil production averaged 4.2 million barrels per day in 2017, according to National Energy Board estimates, up from 3.9 million bpd in 2016. \nProduction is expected to rise further this year as new projects like Suncor Energy\u2019s 190,000 bpd Fort Hills oil sands plant expand operations. \nHowever, the increase in shipments will be capped by railroad operators\u2019 willingness to accept spot deliveries. Companies such as Canadian National Railway, have insisted on long-term crude-by-rail commitments before providing more rail capacity. \n\u201cThere is a two or three-year window, irrespective of what happens to pipelines, that rail is going to be required to move product to market,\u201d said John Zahary, chief executive at Altex Energy, which owns five rail terminals in Canada.

People walk past a Debenhams store in Stockport, Britain January 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Phil Noble \nShares in the 240-year-old company slumped as much as 24 percent after the mid-market retailer rushed out sales figures a week earlier than expected. \nIts performance underlines the threat to traditional British retailers from online competition, a decline in demand for clothing and pressure on consumer spending. \nChief Executive Sergio Bucher said customers had \u201ccome late to Christmas\u201d, and when they did start shopping its gifts were not special enough to encourage them to buy without discounts. \n\u201cGifting has become very promotional,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIn hindsight, if I\u2019d do anything different I think my gifting pipeline would be more premium and differentiated.\u201d \nDebenhams is second ranked in department stores by sales value to John Lewis, which said on Wednesday its sales in the week before Christmas rose 8.9 percent. \nBucher said a raspberry-flavoured gin flew off the shelves, but lower priced items at Debenhams such as cards and decorations did not appeal. \nIt held its ground in a declining clothing market, he added, and stronger demand for beauty and food helped drive a 1.2 percent rise in like-for-like sales in the six weeks before Christmas. \nBut shoppers did not return for the post-Christmas sale, resulting in more price cuts and a further dent to margins. \nTrade in September and October had also been poor, contributing to an overall 2.6 percent fall in underlying British sales in the 17 weeks to 30 December. NOT BUSINESS AS USUAL \nBucher, a former Amazon ( AMZN.O ) and Inditex executive, who joined Debenhams in 2016, set out a plan to revive the company in April, centred on closing a few stores, revamping others, cutting promotions and improving its online offer. Slideshow (2 Images) \nHe said on Thursday the strategy would be implemented more quickly, with another 10 million pounds of cost cuts largely from central functions that would entail some job losses. \n\u201cWe need to get there quicker because business as usual will not make us successful in the future,\u201d he said. \nThe group, which trades from over 240 stores across 27 countries, has already identified 10 stores that could become loss-making and subsequently closed. \nIts shares were trading almost 16 percent at 30 pence at 1225 GMT, weighing on fellow retailers such as Marks & Spencer ( MKS.L ), just a day after an upbeat statement from Next ( NXT.L ) raised hopes that retailers had defied forecasts for gloomy Christmas trading. \nBroker Peel Hunt downgraded Debenhams to \u201csell\u201d from \u201chold\u201d after the warning but cautioned against trying to read too much into it. \n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a retailing or macro issue, this is all about Debenhams,\u201d their analysts said. \u201cWe believe the customer proposition is simply not compelling enough.\u201d \nThe share price fall netted estimated profits of around 12 million pounds on Thursday for hedge funds \u201cshorting\u201d, or betting against the stock, according to Reuters calculations. \nEight hedge funds, including Blackrock and Odey Asset Management, have short positions totalling 14.3 percent of the company \u2013 the second highest on any UK stock, according to filings from UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority. \nDebenhams biggest shareholder is Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct ( SPD.L ), which holds 21 percent.

The delay, however, is likely to impact Tesla\u2019s cashflow, a big challenge for many quarters now. \nTesla said on Wednesday it would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised. The company now expects to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter. \n\u201cWith absolute Model 3 sales tracking behind expectations and Model 3 gross margin improvement likely to be pushed out until production reaches greater scale, the expected cash tailwind from Model 3 will take longer to manifest itself than was anticipated,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst George Galliers said in a note. \nTesla, headed by Elon Musk, has been struggling to overcome production bottlenecks and reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss in the July-September quarter. \nThe company burned through $1.1 billion in cash in that quarter and said in November it would spend roughly the same amount in the fourth quarter. It had about $3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Sept. 30. \nChief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja had reassured investors that cash flow would \u201cimprove significantly\u201d over the next few quarters as Tesla continued to ramp up Model 3 production. Slideshow (2 Images) \nTesla shares were down at $313.02 in afternoon trading.

Eight have a \u201chold\u201d rating and the rest a \u201csell\u201d or lower. \n\u201cWe believe that Tesla may have finally set a beatable production target,\u201d Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said in a note. \n\u201cImportantly, we believe that Tesla is prioritizing quality control. While Tesla\u2019s repeated guidance revisions could begin to risk damaging its elite brand, a mass-recall would probably be far more damaging,\u201d he said. \nTesla\u2019s luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs regularly require fixes before they can leave the factory and quality checks have routinely revealed defects in nearly all of these models inspected after assembly, Reuters reported in November, citing sources. \nTesla has maintained that its quality control process is unusually rigorous. \nAnalysts said on Thursday they continue to believe that sales of the Model 3 sedan could transform the niche automaker into a mass producer, giving it an edge over a host of rivals such as General Motors Co ( GM.N ) and BMW ( BMWG.DE ) who are entering the nascent electric car market. \n\u201cGiven that TSLA received over 400k Model 3 reservations with essentially no marketing, we believe potential demand for the vehicle is likely underestimated, and think TSLA could significantly increase demand through its own advertising in the future,\u201d Baird Equity Research analyst Ben Kallo said.

FILE PHOTO - Rebels of Colombia's Marxist National Liberation Army (ELN) arrive in a boat, in the northwestern jungles, Colombia August 30, 2017. Picture taken August 30, 2017. REUTERS\/Federico Rios \nThe attacks threatened peace talks scheduled to resume on Wednesday between the National Liberation Army (ELN) and the government. \nThe negotiations have been under way in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, since the beginning of last year in a bid to end more than 53 years of fighting but President Juan Manuel Santos ordered his chief negotiator back to Bogota to evaluate their future. \nThe rebels launched two bomb attacks in the early hours against the Cano Limon oil pipeline, which takes crude from the Cano Limon oil field, operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp, to the Caribbean. Two sections of the pipeline were damaged in Arauca and Boyaca provinces, forcing the suspension of pumping, a senior army official told Reuters. \nThe ELN also tossed a grenade at a naval base in Arauquita, in Arauca province, injuring two soldiers, the official said. \nState oil company Ecopetrol also reported an attack on one of its facilities in a rural area of Aguazul in Casanare province. \nIf talks continue, the assault likely will pressure the government to quickly negotiate a new suspension of hostilities with the ELN. \n\u201cI deplore the decision by the ELN to reactivate its terrorist attacks,\u201d Santos said in a televised address. \u201cThe government was always willing to extend the ceasefire. Inexplicably, the ELN refused. Under the circumstances I have ordered the return of our chief negotiator to evaluate the future of talks.\u201d \nThe group\u2019s first-ever ceasefire, which began in October, ended overnight without being extended as logistical problems prevented the two sides from meeting at the scheduled time on Monday, the government said. \nThe ELN has said it will not extend the truce under original terms and wants a new deal. \nBefore the attacks, centre-right Santos had not said he would launch an immediate offensive against the group now that the ceasefire has ended. \nDuring the ceasefire, reached on Sept. 4, the insurgent group promised to suspend hostage-taking, attacks on roads and oil installations, the use of landmines and the recruitment of minors. In turn, the government agreed to improve protection for community leaders and conditions for about 450 jailed rebels. \nThe 2,000-strong ELN has caused serious difficulty in the oil industry with its regular bombings of infrastructure and has taken numerous oil workers hostages over the years. It has clashed with other armed groups during the ceasefire. \nSantos, who leaves office this year, signed a peace deal with the larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in late 2016 after negotiations in Cuba that lasted four years. \nThe FARC is now a political party with a candidate for president in May elections. \nThe ELN, founded by radical Roman Catholic priests in 1964, has sought peace with the government before but made little progress. It is considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union. Reporting by Helen Murphy; Additional reporting by Luis Jaime Acosta; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Bill Trott"}

Ten students from universities in Tehran and some other cities are in an uncertain position, and ... it is still unknown which body has detained them,\" the labour news agency ILNA quoted reformist politician Mahmoud Sadeghi as saying.\nIran has several parallel security bodies and residents say arrests are often not immediately announced.\nVideos that appeared on social media in recent days showed relatives of detainees gathering outside prisons seeking information about the fate of their loved ones.\nThe Revolutionary Guard and its affiliated Basij militia suppressed unrest in 2009, in which dozens of pro-reform Iranians were killed."}

{"published":"2018-01-12T20:00:00.000+02:00","title":"Trump opponents use 's---hole' comments to dodge the truth\u2014Commentary","text":"Newsflash: President Donald Trump isn't a politically correct or polite person.\nOkay, that's not really news. But it's top of mind right now after several sources reported that Trump, when asked about protections for immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and African countries, said: \"Why are we having all these people from s---hole countries come here?\"\nFriday morning Trump denied he used that exact language but admitted he used tough words. He also denied saying anything about Haitian people:\nTrump tweet\nTrump tweet 2\nAn inevitable, but regrettable media freakout continues over his comments.\nIt's regrettable for a number of reasons. First, the president is being attacked by a sanctimonious crowd that has routinely denigrated the living conditions of the countries Trump was talking about.\nIn fact, those terrible conditions are often cited by open borders advocates as the primary reason why the U.S. should allow people from those nations into our country as refugees.\nPresident Barack Obama was one of those people using harsh, just not profane, words to describe his father's home country of Kenya while he was actually visiting there in 2015.\nHe said the country was improving economically. But he also scolded the people and leaders of Kenya for \"stupid\" traditions like holding back women economically through a lack of education access and practicing female genital mutilation. He assailed the nation's \"cancer of corruption\" and tribal culture that was \"doomed to tear (it) apart.\"\nObama was exactly right. No, he didn't use profanities. But using words like \"stupid\" to describe another country's traditions isn't exactly Emily Post material.\nThe hypocrisy doesn't stop there. The idea that our political leaders shouldn't use vulgarities is certainly something we can discuss in our homes and schools. But the mainstream news media long ago forfeited any right to be sanctimonious about that.\nThis is the same news media that cheered then Vice President Joe Biden's \"this is a big f**king deal\" comment to Obama when he signed the Affordable Care Act. It's the same media that barely called out Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti when he deliberately used the F-word in a public celebration for the Stanley Cup champion L.A. Kings in 2014.\nSo when Trump uses vulgarity, it's different. It's apparently license to definitively conclude, for the umpteenth time, that he is a racist. This is the dominant narrative right now even as the president insists he meant no insult to actual people and was just describing the universally accepted sorry state of things in their countries.\nSimply put, this is a stretch. It's something humorist and \"Dilbert\" comic strip creator Scott Adams calls the \"psychic psychiatrist\" illusion. That is, when we hear words from someone we don't know personally that could be innocuous but decide we know their real intent.\nBut the biggest reason this focus on the president's alleged vulgar choice of words is regrettable is that it's clouding the real debate.\nHere are some of the questions we need to be asking and answering about immigration instead of once again wasting hours and hours parsing Trump's every little word:\nWe want to be compassionate, but is family-based chain migration fair to our existing citizens and best for our economy? Would a new focus on bringing in more skilled workers from countries that produce them be a better idea? Conservatives and even some top labor advocates think so. If we all agree that the so-called \"dreamers\" are in a tough spot because their parents brought them here illegally as children, isn't it a very good idea to better secure our borders so that this scenario does not keep repeating itself? Are Democrats and Republicans only looking at immigration from the lens of election results? Do Democrats want immigration from impoverished countries with unskilled immigrants because they tend to vote Democrat? And do Republicans favor more skilled immigrants from places like India because there's a better chance they'll vote Republican? How about a little honesty here? There's also a time element involved here as the Jan. 19 deadline for a spending bill looms larger. If Congress can't agree on a DACA rule protection for the \"dreamers,\" the government could be shut down. Trump balked at a bipartisan deal reached on DACA, saying it needed to provide better border security.\nThe fact is this country deserves to have a calm and fair debate about our immigration policies. Yes, Trump's harsh words have hurt that cause. But the people deciding to make those words from a closed meeting a major story and mine them for political capital are even guiltier of causing this distraction right now.\nOf course, politicians on both sides have long since established that scoring political points is much more important to them than sound immigration policy, compassion for refugees or concern about vulgarity.\nAnd that's the greatest vulgarity of them all.\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

{"published":"2018-01-23T01:30:00.000+02:00","title":"Michael Moritz is right: Silicon Valley should be terrified of China","text":"The reaction has been swift and negative to investor Michael Moritz's essay arguing Silicon Valley companies have something to learn from China's hard-working entrepreneurship culture. Moritz, a partner at the exceptionally successful venture capital firm Sequoia, has been accused of being sexist , out of touch , and an evangelist of workaholism .\nI've spent my entire career working in China and travel to Shanghai monthly to visit manufacturing partners as CEO of Anomalie , a Silicon Valley-based e-commerce wedding dress company. My takeaway from visiting the country over 30 times is clear: Silicon Valley should be terrified to compete with Chinese entrepreneurs over the coming years.\nBased on my experience, the Bay Area criticism of Moritz reflects a lack of appreciation for China's recent history, a misunderstanding of the factors driving the work ethic of Chinese workers, and a worrying belief that Silicon Valley's pre-eminence as the center of entrepreneurship is to be inherited by future generations instead of fought for.\nThe first generation In Silicon Valley circles, it is common to acknowledge that people in China work harder than us but there is a prevailing sense that the Chinese miss an \"innovation gene.\" The thinking goes that China might outwork us, but Silicon Valley competitiveness will be sustained by a unique ecosystem that encourages risk-taking and invention.\nI used to have this biased view too but then I met Esther, the owner of a garment factory I worked with years ago. Walking with her through the floor of her 1,000-person operation, I asked her whether the enterprise was a family business. She gave me a confused look and said, \"The phrase 'Family Business' does not exist in China. My parents grew up during the Cultural Revolution.\"\nShe informed me of a fact I was embarrassingly ignorant of: this is China's first generation of entrepreneurs. The older generation, which runs the country and most large Chinese companies today, lived through a period of unfathomable violence, starvation and poverty under Mao. The biographies of China's leaders are case studies in human resourcefulness and resolve. The current President, Xi Jinping, had his education cut off at 15 and was later arrested for deserting his rural area and forced to dig ditches in a labor camp. Huang Nubo, one of China's richest men, saw his family lose everything and father commit suicide during the Cultural Revolution \u2013 he now writes poetry about this horrifying period.\nI have deep disagreements and concerns with many decisions the Chinese government makes domestically and internationally. But that doesn't negate that fact that what China has achieved over the past 40 years is the fastest and largest movement of humans from poverty to prosperity in history. The key lesson we should take from China's innovation culture is how fast it has developed, and how concerned we should be to compete with the ascending generation.\nThe Chinese work ethic springs from optimism Getting off the plane in Shanghai, I always have a sense that a once-in-a-century global shift is occurring and opportunity is everywhere.\nDetractors of Moritz's essay claim that long work hours in China is \" sadistic ,\" but I don't sense most people in China feel this way. Far from a dystopian workaholic state, I see in China a sense of optimism, feeling of upward mobility, and pace of improvement that is extraordinary. With the horrors of Mao still in recent memory, I (and I think many in China) see it as very inspirational that so many people have the opportunity to now work hard, provide for their families, and take them to Disneyland on the weekend.\nIt is also worth noting that the majority of managers I've worked with in China have been women. While they might not see their kids left often as they'd like, they are able to give those children a life their parents could have never dreamed of. Tens of millions of moms are also able to provide incredible role models to their children of what a smart, hard-working woman looks like.\nFrom my experience, the U.S. can learn a lot from China about women and work. A significantly higher percentage of Chinese tech companies have C-Suite women leaders than their U.S. counterparts. One senior female executive told me that she agrees with Warren Buffet's assertion that the U.S. economy has been operating for much of its history at \"50% capacity\" because of attitudes towards women. While there are obviously systemic gender inequities China must work through, I have personally never been in an environment that felt more meritocratic and less devoid of gender politics than when I am working with a Chinese team.\nThe younger generation in China is optimistic, hard-working, aggressively upwardly mobile, and adopting new tech trends and a furious pace . We should only expect China's pace of innovation to increase as they take over levers of power.\nTake the Flight In short, compared to the United States, China is an economy that is improving its innovation engine at an unprecedented rate with more workers who work longer hours at a higher labor participation rate. The disdain with which the Silicon Valley Twittersphere reacted to Moritz's call to learn from China unfortunately only highlights his point that a competitiveness gap is growing.\nThere are three direct flights per day from SFO to Shanghai. The flight is a quick 12 hours and often costs only $300. Everyone on our team makes this trip and I encourage anyone who cares about the future competitiveness of Silicon Valley to take this trip and view what is happening in China (particularly among the rising entrepreneurial generation).\nThe entrepreneurial economy is not zero-sum, and I hope that the competition among Chinese and American startups over the next generation will lift all boats. China is definitely learning from us and iterating quickly. Silicon Valley should heed the calls to learn from them.\nLeslie Voorhees is the CEO and co-founder of Anomalie , which brings more customization, transparency, and value to wedding dresses. She previously worked in supply chain operations for Nike and Apple in China. \nWATCH: There's more to investing in China than technology \nshow chapters There more to investing in China than technology      12:14 AM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 | 02:28"}

FILE PHOTO: Broken representations of the Bitcoin virtual currency, placed on a monitor that displays binary digits, are seen in this illustration picture, December 8, 2017. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo \nThe joint inspection by the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) will check if banks are adhering to anti-money laundering rules and using real names for accounts, FSC Chairman Choi Jong-ku told a press conference. \nThe six banks named by the regulator have all provided virtual currency accounts to clients that handle cryptocurrencies, according to the FSC. The banks are NH Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea ( 024110.KS ), Shinhan Bank [SHINBC.UL], Kookmin Bank [KOOKM.UL], Woori Bank ( 000030.KS ) and Korea Development Bank [KDB.UL]. \nChoi said the inspections are intended to provide guidance to banks and are not the result of any suspected wrongdoing. \n\u201cVirtual currency is currently unable to function as a means of payment and it is being used for illegal purposes like money laundering, scams and fraudulent investor operations,\u201d said Choi. \n\u201cThe side effects have been severe, leading to hacking problems at the institutions that handle cryptocurrency and an unreasonable spike in speculation.\u201d \nA Woori Bank spokesperson told Reuters the bank was filling out a checklist for the inspection. The spokesperson said Woori had stopped providing virtual account services last month as the costs of using a real-name transaction system were too prohibitive. \nNH Bank and Shinhan Bank representatives declined to comment, while the other three banks could not immediately be reached for comment. \nChoi said authorities are also looking at ways to reduce risks associated with cryptocurrency trading in the country, which could include shutting down institutions that use such currencies. \nLast month, the government said it would impose additional measures to regulate speculation in cryptocurrency trading within the country, including a ban on anonymous cryptocurrency accounts and new legislation to allows regulators to close virtual coin exchanges if needed. \nBitcoin BTC=BTSP and other virtual coins have been extremely popular in South Korea, drawing wide investments from housewives and students. Government officials have expressed concern over frenzied speculation, with South Korea's central bank chief warning of \"irrational exuberance\" in trading of virtual currency last month. \nA South Korean cryptocurrency exchange, Youbit, shut down and filed for bankruptcy in December after it was hacked twice last year, highlighting security and regulatory concerns. \nSouth Korea\u2019s virtual currency exchanges have been more vulnerable to hackers as bitcoin trades at higher rates on local exchanges than they do elsewhere. As of 0710 GMT, bitcoin\u2019s global price average was trading at $16,294 while in South Korean markets, it stood at 25 million won, or $23,467.35, according to Coinhills.com. \nSouth Korea\u2019s bitcoin prices are higher because of the extreme popularity of the virtual currency in the country, with buyers greatly outnumbering those willing to sell, said Park Nok-sun, a cryptocurrency analyst at NH Investment & Securities. \nThe fact that some of the most active virtual currency exchanges in the world are in South Korea also makes the country an attractive target for hackers, he added. \nChoi warned on Monday authorities would crack down on virtual currency crime and dole out heavy punishments on those who partake in market price manipulation, pyramid schemes and money laundering. \n\u201cNo one knows what is going on at these places that handle cryptocurrency because there is no direct regulation system in place regarding these institutions,\u201d Choi said.

And as expected, industry watchers are now questioning whether the new device can compete with the market leader, Amazon\u2019s Echo. \nLike the Echo, Apple\u2019s HomePod comes with the ability to stream music. HomePod is controlled by Apple\u2019s virtual personal assistant Siri, a competitor to the Echo\u2019s Alexa. Armed with Siri, users will be able to add events to their calendars, control smart home devices like thermostats and light bulbs, and hear text messages sent to their connected iPhones. But at $349, the HomePod is expensive\u2014especially considering that the Echo costs $100. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter \nBut this week wasn\u2019t only about HomePod. So read on for the biggest news and rumors from this week in Apple news: \nThis is Fortune \u2019s latest weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news . Here\u2019s last week\u2019s roundup . Apple this week announced that its HomePod would go on sale on Feb. 9 . The company also opened pre-orders Friday morning . The HomePod will cost $349 and will be available in both gray and white . If you\u2019re not a fan of Apple\u2019s stores, you can also pre-order the smart speaker at Best Buy . Apple CEO Tim Cook this week made the sales pitch for HomePod by saying it would offer the best sound of any other smart speaker . He also touted its integration with Apple\u2019s software, including Apple Music streaming, Siri virtual personal assistant, and messaging app Messages. There appears to be some debate over whether the iPhone X\u2019s sales are strong . Researcher Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) said that iPhone X accounted for 20% of all U.S. iPhone sales in the fourth quarter. That was enough for the iPhone X to top the iPhone 8 Plus, which accounted for 17% of total iPhone sales, but the $1,000 smartphone lagged the iPhone 8\u2019s 24% market share. Although that\u2019s not the best of news for Apple, CIRP said that the iPhone X was released in November and therefore didn\u2019t benefit from October sales like the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus did. The CIRP study was followed this week by a report from research firm Canalys, which said that Apple sold 29 million iPhone Xs in the fourth quarter , including 7 million in the U.S. That was enough to top the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, according to Canalys. Still, the researcher said that the iPhone has performed \u201c slightly below industry expectations .\u201d Apple in December acquired music-discovery service Shazam for a reported $400 million. And this week, DN Capital analyst Mark Mulligan said that it\u2019s possible the Shazam buy will net Apple up to 7.5 million new subscribers to Apple Music . Mulligan said Shazam has 150 million monthly active users and that he believes up to 5% of them who aren\u2019t Apple Music subscribers will now sign up for the streaming-music service. He didn\u2019t say when he expects those users to sign up. Apple will release a software update that will let users disable a function that slows down older iPhones when their batteries start to malfunction. Apple had previously released software that would slow down an iPhone when its battery was low or not working properly. The feature ensured the iPhone wouldn\u2019t randomly shut down. After facing widespread criticism, Apple will allow users to disable the feature, but it suggested that they don\u2019t actually turn it off. \nOne more thing\u2026 Apple\u2019s hiring of product designers has risen sharply since October. Of course, Apple isn\u2019t saying why, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the speculation from running rampant. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

He also reiterated his $104 price target for EA stock, which is 9 percent lower than Thursday's close. \nThe analyst said research and development spending growth is accelerating for gaming companies. He noted R&D budgets for the four largest publishers grew at roughly a 1 percent annual rate from 2010 to 2015, then rose to more than 8 percent per year the last two years. \nCreutz said the outrage over the initial money-making strategy in EA's \"Star Wars Battlefront II\" likely hurt the title's sales by 3 million to 4 million units versus the company's 14 million guidance. He noted Activision's \"Destiny 2\" player engagement is waning after the community questioned the game's design decisions. \nThe \"industry plans to further expand live services revenue appear to have run into some roadblocks with gamers sounding off against some recent titles, notably EA's \"Star Wars Battlefront II\" and Activision's \"Destiny 2\" (though the issues with the latter go beyond just MTX),\" he wrote. \"We think writing off angry gamers as largely irrelevant is a mistake.\" \nHe added: \n\"[Star Wars Battlefront II] has pretty clearly significantly underperformed expectations and remains without a live services revenue stream, while Destiny 2 has at the least suffered some unwanted engagement attrition. We suspect that 2018 will see a pullback on industry attempts to aggressively drive MTX growth as a result.\" \nThe analyst also warned gaming industry stocks may falter due to high expectations. \n\"Current valuations are pricing in an awful lot of good news, with an investor base that seems at least somewhat complacent,\" he wrote. \"It's not just that gamers are angry and complaining; there have clearly been performance consequences for the games involved. And in an industry where every company is dependent upon a relatively small number of franchises, this matters.\" \nElectronic Arts and Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to requests for comment."}

Hafiz Muhammad Saeed (C), chief of the Islamic charity organisation Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), speaks to supporters during a gathering to protest against Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, in Rawalpindi, Pakistan December 29, 2017. REUTERS\/Faisal Mahmood \nPakistan\u2019s civilian government detailed its plans in a secret order to various provincial and federal government departments on Dec. 19, three officials who attended one of several high-level meeting discussing the crackdown told Reuters. \nMarked \u201csecret\u201d, a Dec. 19 document from the finance ministry directed law enforcement and governments in Pakistan\u2019s five provinces to submit an action plan by Dec. 28 for a \u201ctakeover\u201d of Saeed\u2019s two charities, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and the Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation. \nThe United States has labelled JuD and FIF \u201cterrorist fronts\u201d for Lashkar-e-Taiba (\u201cArmy of the Pure\u201d or LeT), a group Saeed founded in 1987 and which Washington and India blame for the 2008 attacks in Mumbai that killed 166 people. \nSaeed has repeatedly denied involvement in the Mumbai attacks and a Pakistani court saw insufficient evidence to convict him. The LeT could not be reached for comment. \nThe Dec. 19 document, which refers to \u201cFinancial Action Task Force (FATF) issues\u201d, names only Saeed\u2019s two charities and \u201cactions to be taken\u201d against them. \nThe FATF, an international body that combats money laundering and terrorist financing, has warned Pakistan it faces inclusion on a watch list for failing to crack down on financing terrorism. \nAsked about a crackdown on JuD and FIF, Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who co-chaired one of the meetings on the plan, responded only generally, saying he has ordered authorities \u201cto choke the fundraising of all proscribed outfits in Pakistan\u201d. \nIn a written reply to Reuters, he also said Pakistan wasn\u2019t taking action under U.S. pressure. \u201cWe\u2019re not pleasing anyone. We\u2019re working as a responsible nation to fulfil our obligations to our people and international community.\u201d \nIn response to the Reuters article, JuD spokesman Yahya Mujahid said the organisation will go to court if the government decides to take over JuD and FIF. \n\u201cWe will not keep silent. We will fight a legal battle,\u201d Mujahid said in statement, terming the government move illegal. \nSaeed could not be reached for comment. He has frequently denied having ties to militants and says the charitable organisations he founded and controls have no terrorism ties. He says he promotes an Islamic-oriented government through doing good works. \nOn Monday, some of the first directives from the proposed crackdown were put in place. \nThe country\u2019s financial regulator, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), issued an order that \u201cprohibits\u201d all companies from donating money to Saeed, LeT, JuD, FiF and other groups and individuals who are named on the U.N. Security Council sanctions lists. \nIn the capital Islamabad, the district magistrate banned proscribed organisations from \u201cfund-raising in any kind and social, political, welfare and religious activities by these groups\u201d, according to an order reviewed by Reuters.

REUTERS\/Faisal Mahmood \nThe two-month ban, which can be extended, was put into place \u201cto curb the terrorist acts and assistance activites carried out by the proscribed organisations and their subsidiary welfare wings,\u201d the document said. FIRST MAJOR MOVE \nIf the government follows through with the plan, it would mark the first time Pakistan has made a major move against Saeed\u2019s network, which includes 300 seminaries and schools, hospitals, a publishing house and ambulance services. The JuD and FIF alone have about 50,000 volunteers and hundreds of other paid workers, according to two counter-terrorism officials. \nParticipants at the meeting raised the possibility that the government\u2019s failure to act against the charities could lead to U.N. sanctions, one of the three officials said. A U.N. Security Council team is due to visit Pakistan in late January to review progress against U.N.-designated \u201cterrorist\u201d groups. Hafiz Saeed is showered with flower petals as he walks to court before a Pakistani court ordered his release from house arrest in Lahore, Pakistan November 22, 2017. REUTERS\/Mohsin Raza \n\u201cAny adverse comments or action suggested by the team can have far-reaching implications for Pakistan,\u201d the official said. \nThe Dec. 19 document gave few details about how the state would take over Saeed\u2019s charities, pending the plans submitted from the provincial governments. It did say it would involve government entities taking over ambulance services and accounting for other vehicles used by the charities. \nIt says law enforcement agencies will coordinate with Pakistan\u2019s intelligence agencies to identify the assets of the two charities and examine how they raise money. \nThe document also directs that the name of JuD\u2019s 200-acre headquarters, Markaz-e-Taiba, near the eastern city of Lahore be changed to something else \u201dto make it known that the Government of \u201cPunjab (province) solely manages and operates the Markaz(headquarters)\u201d. \nThe move to seize the charities could spark some concern from the powerful military, which has proposed plans to steer Saeed and the JuD into mainstream politics. The military did not respond to a request for comment. \nIn August, JuD officials formed a new political party, the Milli Muslim League, and backed candidates who fared relatively strongly in two key parliamentary by-elections. \nThe JuD publicly disavows armed militancy inside Pakistan, but offers vocal support for the cause of rebel fighters in Indian-administered Kashmir and has called for Pakistan to retake Kashmir. Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the disputed region. \nWashington, which has offered a $10 million reward for information leading to Saeed\u2019s conviction over the Mumbai attacks, warned Islamabad of repercussions after a Pakistani court in late November released him from house arrest. \nPunjab\u2019s provincial government had put Saeed under house arrest for 10 months this year for violating anti-terrorism laws. \nWriting on Twitter on Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States has \u201cfoolishly\u201d handed Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid over the last 15 years while getting nothing in return and pledged to put a stop to it.

{"published":"2018-01-04T13:27:00.000+02:00","title":"'Bomb Cyclone' Leaves Energy and Retail Sectors Exposed | Fortune","text":"By Bloomberg 11:27 AM EST \nThe worst winter storm yet this season is already hitting the Southeast and expected to sweep the Northeast Thursday, threatening to send electricity prices and natural gas demand even higher, boosting energy stocks. The arctic blast could also serve as a positive for companies that provide deicing salt, as well as car parts retailers that stand to benefit from more weather-related replacements. \nMajority of the sectors in the S&P 500 traded higher, led by gains in energy (+1.5%), information technology (+1%) and health care (+0.9%) while telecommunications (-2.3%) and utilities (-0.8%) lagged. Energy\/Utilities \nNatural gas-related stocks and utilities with the most exposure to the East Coast will likely see an impact from the storm as demand for heating rises. While high winds and ice could lead to some downed power lines, electricity prices near their highest levels in years helps to offset downside risks. The cold weather pushed natural gas futures to their highest in a month on Tuesday, though prices have pared gains after rising 16 percent over four days. Natural gas-exposed E&Ps include Southwestern Energy, Range Resources, Ultra Petroleum, and Cabot Oil & Gas. EOG Resources and Pioneer Natural are among the top-performing oil and gas E&Ps Wednesday after positive comments earlier from Citigroup . National Fuel Gas had its largest gain in eight months Tuesday after receiving an upgrade from Sidoti on prospects for higher pricing on the back of record cold weather. East Coast power utilities include Duke, Dominion, NextEra, Consolidated Edison , PPL , Public Service Enterprise Group and Exelon . The cold will likely be a \u201cwindfall\u201d for Dominion and NextEra, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kit Konolige. Also watch Generac Holdings, a provider of portable generators serving residential and commercial markets. Insurance \nCatastrophe losses may be in focus for insurers if the storm is like what was seen in the severe weather events of 2014 and 2015 in the Northeast. Snow is \u201cnot especially threatening in itself,\u201d BI analyst Jonathan Adams said, but the dangers are in the \u201ccombination of wind and ice.\u201d Potential risks include freezing pipes and downed limbs from ice-related damage, which could boost losses. Insurers to watch include Chubb and Travelers. Industrials \nShares of deicing salt provider Compass Minerals and snowplow maker Douglas Dynamics may gain. On Tuesday, Stifel analyst Paul Forward wrote that the firm\u2019s proprietary gauge shows that snowfall occurrences have begun to accelerate in the companies\u2019 key markets, indicating more upside to 2017-2018 salt sales. Investors should also watch equipment and machinery companies such as Caterpillar and snowmobile maker Arctic Cat. Makers and distributors of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems may stand to benefit. Companies to watch include Watsco, Lennox International and Ingersoll-Rand. Airlines \nAirlines will most likely experience some service disruptions, delays and cancellations depending on the severity of the storm, with some impact from rescheduled flights spilling over into the weekend. Auto Parts Retailers \nCar parts retailers are poised to benefit as extreme weather conditions damage vehicles and send car owners to stores for repairs and replacement parts. The group underperformed the broader market in 2017 after a mild winter dampened demand and investors worried about the growing threat from e-commerce, especially Amazon . According to Wedbush analyst Seth Basham, the prevailing freezing temperatures are \u201cjust what the doctor ordered\u201d for auto parts retailers, adding that a more normal winter season will likely lead to more parts failures as compared to last year, and ultimately above-average industry sales growth. The S&P Supercomposite Automotive Retail Sub Industry Index, a standard gauge for the group, dropped almost 11 percent last year, while the S&P 500 Index rose 19 percent. Retail \nClothing retailers unlikely to be broadly affected. \u201cWhile the snowstorm can result in store closings and shoppers choosing to stay at home, it\u2019s unlikely to dent 4Q retail sales as it comes in a low-volume sales period,\u201d BI analyst Poonam Goyal says. Burlington Stores , TJX Companies, New York & Co. and Abercrombie & Fitch are among apparel retailers with more than 30 percent of their stores in the states that may be affected by the storm. \u201cFood retailers and mass merchants may get a sales bump from customers stocking up ahead of the storm,\u201d according to BI analyst Jennifer Bartashus. Mass merchants may try to quickly move more winter-weather inventory into affected areas, particularly those unaccustomed to the low temperatures and snow. Ingles Markets has 89 percent of its stores in East Coast states expected to see at least some storm activity, followed by Weis Markets, Target , Wal-Mart , Kroger Healthcare \nThe health-care sector probably won\u2019t be affected over the long term by the winter storm, but hospitals could face some short-term volume pressure if snowstorms extend for more than a few days, similar to what happened with hurricanes in the third quarter, according to BI analyst Jason McGorman. Health insurers at the time didn\u2019t quantify the effect on earnings. The impact should be insignificant for pharmaceutical and biotech companies, BI\u2019s Asthika Goonewardene says, as revenue and inventories shouldn\u2019t be affected. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

Lynch 6   An associate of Donald Trump expressed concerns to the FBI about contacts between Russia and Trump\u2019s presidential election campaign team, helping to trigger the probe into possible collusion, according to closed-door testimony made public on Tuesday by a senior Democrat. \nGlenn Simpson, who leads the Washington research firm Fusion GPS, said in his August testimony that the Federal Bureau of Investigation received intelligence from a \u201cvoluntary source\u201d in Trump\u2019s orbit in 2016, before a former British spy gave the FBI his own \u201cdossier\u201d of allegations about collusion. \nFusion GPS hired the former spy, Christopher Steele, to investigate Trump\u2019s business dealings with Russia. \nSome Republicans critical of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials have claimed the initial FBI probe was triggered by Steele\u2019s dossier. \nThey have raised questions about whether the FBI may have relied on the Steele document to improperly obtain surveillance warrants to spy on Trump\u2019s campaign associates. \nSimpson\u2019s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in August contradicted those claims. \n\u201cThey had other intelligence about this matter from an internal Trump campaign source and ... they believed Chris\u2019 information might be credible,\u201d Simpson testified. \u201cI think it was a voluntary source, someone who was concerned about the same concerns we had.\u201d \nSimpson later said he was not sure if the FBI informant was from the Trump election campaign or the Trump Organization, the president\u2019s real estate firm, which is now run by his two older sons. \nDianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate committee, released the testimony without Republican approval, in an apparent bid to neutralise Republican criticism of the Russia investigation. \nSteele\u2019s dossier contains a number of inflammatory and salacious allegations about Trump and his alleged connections to Russia. Trump has slammed the dossier as \u201cbogus\u201d and denies his campaign colluded with Russia. \nTRUMP\u2018S PERSONAL LAWYER FILES LAWSUITS \nOn Tuesday, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen filed two defamation lawsuits, one in New York state court against the popular website BuzzFeed News, which published the Fusion GPS dossier last year, and the second in federal court against Fusion GPS itself, ABC News reported. \nBoth lawsuits say the dossier compiled by Fusion GPS and contained \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d allegations about Cohen that resulted in \u201charm to his personal and professional reputation, current business interests, and the impairment of business opportunities,\u201d according to ABC News. \nCohen is mentioned in the dossier as having suspicious ties to Russian figures. Those allegations have not been verified. \nBuzzFeed responded with a Twitter post that said the dossier continues to be the subject of investigations by Congress and intelligence agencies, was shown to two U.S. presidents and described in detail by news outlets worldwide. \n\u201cIts interest to the public is obvious. This is not the first time Trump\u2019s lawyer has attacked the free press, and we look forward to defending our First Amendment rights in court,\u201d BuzzFeed said. \nThe lawsuits were not immediately available on online court websites. \nTrump and some Republicans have attacked both Simpson\u2019s firm and Steele in recent months and also questioned the impartiality of the FBI and the Justice Department in an apparent effort to discredit Mueller\u2019s probe. \nMueller\u2019s team has produced two indictments and two guilty pleas by former Trump campaign aides. \nRepublicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Charles Grassley, had declined to release Simpson\u2019s testimony, saying he had refused to testify at a public hearing and failed to answer questions or turn over records. \nGrassley\u2019s office slammed Feinstein for releasing the testimony, saying it came as the panel was still trying to interview other witnesses, including Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. \n\u201cHer action undermines the integrity of the committee\u2019s oversight work and jeopardizes its ability to secure candid voluntary testimony,\u201d said Grassley spokesman Taylor Foy. \nDemocrats accused Republicans of withholding Simpson\u2019s testimony in order to spread false information about his firm\u2019s role and undermine the Russia probe. \n\u201cThe innuendo and misinformation circulating about the transcript are part of a deeply troubling effort to undermine the investigation into potential collusion and obstruction of justice,\u201d Feinstein said in a statement. \u201cThe only way to set the record straight is to make the transcript public.\u201d \nAlso on Tuesday, a group of House of Representatives Democrats wrote to Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan asking his party to \u201cfully investigate\u201d possible Russian interference in U.S. elections. \n\u201cWe ask you to change course and begin demonstrating true leadership on this national security issue,\u201d said the letter, released a year after U.S. intelligence agencies reported their findings that Russia had sought to intervene in the 2016 election on Trump\u2019s behalf. \nRyan aides did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

REUTERS\/Ammar Abdullah \nSupported by Iran-backed militias and Russian air power, President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces have taken territory in northeastern Hama and southern Idlib provinces since beginning an offensive in late October. \nThe fighting and air strikes have forced more than 60,000 people to leave their homes since Nov. 1, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). \nIn recent days the offensive has escalated, with forces progressing towards the strategic Abu al-Duhur military airport, to which rebels laid siege in 2012 before completely ousting Assad\u2019s forces in September 2015. \nA commander in a military alliance fighting in support of Damascus has said the army and its allies intend to capture the air base. \nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Friday the Syrian army and its allies had taken around 84 villages since Oct. 22, including at least 14 in the past 24 hours. \nThe Britain-based war monitor said the rapid advance this week was made possible by intense air strikes which caused rebels to withdraw. \nThe Syrian army lost Idlib province, which borders Turkey, to insurgents when the provincial capital fell to insurgents in 2015. It became the only province fully under opposition control. \nTahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by al-Qaeda\u2019s former branch in Syria formerly called the Nusra Front, is the main rebel force in the province. \nA Syrian military source said the Nusra Front and its allies are the target of the military operation in northeast Hama and southeast Idlib provinces. \n\u201cThe army\u2019s operations there are continuing and the army is achieving advances. The terrorists (are facing) big losses in the area,\u201d he told Reuters. \nIdlib is part of Russian-engineered \u201cde-escalation zones\u201d meant to reduce fighting in western Syria. Turkish troops are also present in northern Idlib under the de-escalation deal struck with Assad\u2019s allies Russia and Iran. \n\u201cDe-escalation zones do not cover the Nusra Front at all, and the Nusra Front is in reality the one fully controlling Idlib,\u201d the military source said.

It\u2019s as if there\u2019s no de-escalation.\u201d DE-ESCALATION? \nThe United Nations said the situation of civilians newly displaced by the fighting in Idlib was \u201cdire\u201d, with humanitarian agencies struggling to meet their needs. \nYousef, of the Civil Defence, said that even after fleeing heavy frontline air strikes and shelling, people face an air campaign deeper inside the province. \nHe said there are not enough camps to cope with the flows, warning that if the army pushes up to Abu al-Duhur and beyond, \u201cthe displacement will double, it will multiply\u201d. \n\u201cMost of them are sleeping on the ground, in tents that can\u2019t protect from the rain or the cold. Some people are able to rent, but the rent prices have also been very high.\u201d \nIdlib has been a haven for tens of thousands of rebels and civilians forced to abandon their homes in other parts of western Syria that the government and its foreign military allies have recaptured. \nIt has also been the target of intensive Russian and Syrian air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians and destroyed hospitals and civil defence centres. \nCommunities and camps, already hosting thousands of displaced, are struggling to absorb new arrivals. \nU.N. OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said that in Idlib province 55 percent of communities are overburdened. In around 10 percent of these communities, internally displaced persons make up more than 70 percent of the total population. \nOCHA also said the fighting had forced some humanitarian organizations to stop work in parts of southern Idlib. \n\u201cThe greatest need we\u2019re seeing among people struggling to survive in this part of Syria is for food. Having been displaced repeatedly by conflict, they\u2019ve exhausted their resources and are left with few choices, none of them good,\u201d said Christy Delafield of Mercy Corps, one of the largest organisations delivering aid in Syria. \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look to us like things will get easier any time soon.\u201d Reporting by Lisa Barrington and Ellen Francis in Beirut with additional reporting by Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; Editing by Mark Heinrich"}

Penney and Macy\u2019s were down about 6 percent after reporting same-store sales for the key months of November and December. \nSprint fell about 5 percent after the wireless carrier appointed former Altice NV Chief Executive Michel Combes as chief financial officer. \nIntel declined as much as 5 percent, adding to Wednesday\u2019s losses that was triggered by a report that its chips were vulnerable to being hacked. \nRival Advanced Micro Devices rose 6.5 percent. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,692 to 1,065.

{"published":"2018-01-05T14:03:00.000+02:00","title":"Can't please everyone: Trump energy policy riles competing sectors","text":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump proposed new subsidies for coal and nuclear plants, it seemed like an obvious way to deliver on campaign promises to boost the nation\u2019s energy industry.\nAnd yet the plan, announced in September, set off sharp criticism from other sectors that Trump has also vowed to help, such as natural gas and utilities.\n\u201cSubsidies don\u2019t make you competitive - and don\u2019t make you great again,\u201d said Robert Flexon, the president and chief executive of Dynegy Inc ( DYN.N ), a Houston-based utility that owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants.\nSquabbling over the proposal exemplifies the administration\u2019s larger struggle to deliver on promises of a sweeping \u201cenergy renaissance\u201d across the coal, oil, gas and nuclear industries.\nTrouble is, policies that help one of those sectors often hurt another, illustrating the complexity of energy regulation and the difficulty in appeasing competing interests. While election campaigns often seek to neatly divide voters into two camps - those supporting energy vs. those supporting the environment - such rhetoric fails to capture the messier policy impacts on profits, hiring and emissions reductions across the energy landscape.\nThere is little evidence that Trump\u2019s moves so far have aided energy firms of any stripe; some administration proposals have languished amid divisive politics, while other regulatory changes have seen their impact muted by market forces.\nUtilities, for instance, have shown little interest in buying more coal-fired power despite the regulatory rollbacks in Trump\u2019s pro-coal push.\nA broader measure of investor sentiment on the energy industry - the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 energy index - lost more than 7 percent in 2017 even as stock markets soared.\nWhite House and Energy Department officials did not respond to requests for comment.\nAnother political flashpoint has been the administration\u2019s waffling over proposed changes to biofuels policy.\nTrump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency initially entertained a plan from oil refiners to upend regulations requiring them to blend ethanol into their gasoline - then rejected it after a backlash from the ethanol industry, rooted in Midwest corn-growing states that supported Trump\u2019s election.\nThe dispute sparked open warfare among the congressional backers of various industry interests, including threats to block Trump\u2019s agency nominations and accusations he had welched on campaign promises.\nEven the coal industry, which played a starring role in Trump\u2019s campaign, has seen a marginal return on its lobbying efforts. It has, for instance, had little success so far in attacking subsidies for wind and solar power.\nTrump and others in his administration have criticized renewable energy as expensive and dependent on government support. But the White House has not sought to repeal tax breaks expected to provide $12.3 billion to renewable energy firms by 2020, which other Republicans continue to support.\nFossil-fuel firms clearly have more influence on policy under Trump and easier access to decision makers. Coal, oil, and gas company executives have met regularly with senior administration officials, according to official agency schedules.\nTheir policy victories include rollbacks of regulations limiting emissions of carbon, methane and other pollutants; the opening of Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling; and the lifting of a coal-mining moratorium on federal lands.\nBut the impact of these moves on production, profits and jobs remains uncertain. Demand for additional drilling and mining leases on federal lands has been thin, and top U.S. oil and gas companies have told shareholders in regulatory filings that environmental regulations have little impact on their business.\nWhile coal advocates have generally cheered Trump\u2019s ascension, White House policies have so far had little effect on U.S. coal consumption.\nRobert Murray, chief executive of private coal company Murray Energy Corp., said Republican efforts to boost coal have addressed only the \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d of overturning a few environmental regulations while avoiding tougher issues.\nThe oil and gas industry, also championed by Trump, similarly feels let down by an administration it had hoped would strip away government interference, said Susan Ginsburg, a senior vice president of regulatory affairs for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents small oil and gas companies.\nSlideshow (6 Images) The industry, she said, expected that \u201cmarkets would be allowed to work.\u201d\nHELP FOR COAL HURTS NATURAL GAS For the coal industry - which has seen a decade of decline amid competition from cheap natural gas - the wish-list for the Trump administration is long.\nIn the months after Trump was elected, Trump and senior cabinet members including Energy Secretary Rick Perry met with mining executives such as Murray. Other administration officials met with lobbyists for coal firms including Peabody Energy Corp, the nation\u2019s largest miner.\nMurray handed the White House a long list of recommendations, including rescinding pollution controls, slashing the EPA\u2019s size and ending green energy incentives.\nEmails obtained by the Sierra Club in October revealed that Peabody had also given the administration a list of proposals, including a controversial electricity pricing measure based on the argument that coal and nuclear plants improve grid reliability.\nPerry proposed in September that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reward coal and nuclear plants that have 90 days of fuel supply in reserve by covering their operating costs through power pricing changes. FERC is expected to decide on the request by Jan. 10.\nThat proposal irritated oil and gas producers, along with renewable energy firms. Both were caught off guard, said a Washington-based oil-and-gas lobbyist who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern over offending the administration.\n\u201cNobody in the oil and gas industry, or in the renewables industry for that matter, was consulted,\u201c the lobbyist said. \u201dIt just came out of nowhere.\u201d\nThe American Petroleum Institute, which represents major U.S. oil and gas companies, wrote that the plan \u201cupsets the very foundations of the competitive wholesale electricity markets.\u201d\nMichael Steel, a spokesman for the Affordable Energy Coalition, which has oil major BP ( BP.L ) as a member, called the proposal an unfair subsidy.\n\u201cThe Department of Energy is trying to pick winners and losers in a way that will raise costs for consumers by billions of dollars,\u201d Steel said.\n\u2018BROKEN PROGRAM\u2019\nThe political dustup over biofuels policy provides another telling example of the difficulty appeasing competing industry camps.\nThe Renewable Fuel Standard was introduced under former President George W. Bush as a way to help farmers and reduce oil imports. But refining companies say it costs them a fortune and threatens their survival.\nRefiners expected changes to the policy after Trump named billionaire investor and refinery owner Carl Icahn as an unofficial adviser on regulation. Icahn and others proposed shifting the blending requirement to other businesses and reducing biofuels blending quotas.\nBut the proposals drew heavy fire from the ethanol industry and its backers.

Displaced Iraqi children are seen at the Amriyat al Fallujah camp in Anbar Province, Iraq January 3, 2018. REUTERS\/Khalid al-Mousily \nManaging more than two million Iraqis displaced by the war against Islamic State is one of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi\u2019s most daunting tasks. But critics say he is more interested in winning elections in May than alleviating the suffering of displaced Iraqis and returning them safely home. \nAuthorities are sending back people against their will, refugees and aid workers say, to ensure that the election takes place on time. People must be in their area of origin to vote and if they do not get home, this could delay the election. \nAbadi is riding a wave of popularity after defeating Islamic State in Iraq and is anxious the election should not be held up. \nHis strategy is not without its hazards. Abadi risks alienating Sunni voters if displaced Sunnis are seen to be suffering from being sent home to dangerous areas. \nAbadi is seeking a second term in which he plans to fight corruption and maintain national unity in the face of Kurdish separatism. He will need all the votes he can muster to face down a challenge from candidates linked to Iranian-backed Shi\u2018ite militias. MILITARY TRUCKS \nInterviews with aid workers and dozens of displaced people at camps in the town of Amriyat al-Falluja, located in the Sunni heartland of Anbar province, 40 km (25 miles) from Baghdad, as well as with several families who were returned to other areas in the province, reveal that many were forced to go home and several suffered death or injury. \nAid workers said military trucks arrive at camps unannounced and commanders read out lists of people, who have one hour to pack their belongings and go. \nThe aid workers, who all spoke on condition of anonymity, estimated that between 2,400 and 5,000 people were forcibly returned between Nov. 21 and Jan. 2. \n\u201cThese returns are not safe,\u201d said one aid worker. \u201cEven those who don\u2019t openly resist really have no other choice. They cannot really say no to a bunch of people with guns.\u201d \n\u2018THEY GAVE HIM A TENT\u2019 \nAn Iraqi military spokesman said the claim that the military forced displaced civilians to return against their will was an exaggeration. \n\u201cOur primary concern is the safety of our citizens, our job is to protect people,\u201d Iraqi Joint Operations Command Spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Rasool told Reuters. \nHowever, \u201ccitizens have to go home\u201d now that Islamic State had been defeated, he said. \nSome aid workers said local military commanders told them the orders came from Abadi\u2019s office. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. \nOn Nov. 25, security forces arrived at a camp in Amriyat al-Falluja and told Saleh Ahmed, 37, and his family to return to their home town of Betaya, his father, Mahdi Ahmed, said. \nThey refused because contacts at home told them the area was filled with booby-traps left by retreating Islamic State fighters and their houses had been destroyed. \nA local commander assured them the area was safe, saying it was \u201cbetter to go live in a tent in your home town than live in a tent in the camp\u201d. \nSaleh reluctantly took his wife and some of his children and got on the truck. Mahdi Ahmed, 72, remained at the camp with his sick wife, another son, and some of Saleh\u2019s children as their names were not on the list. A displaced Iraqi woman carries a water container at the Amriyat al Fallujah camp in Anbar Province, Iraq January 3, 2018. REUTERS\/Khalid al-Mousily \n\u201cThey gave him a tent. He went back to our destroyed house and tried to pitch it in our yard,\u201d Mahdi Ahmed told Reuters at the camp in Amriyat al-Falluja. \nAn explosive went off. Saleh\u2019s wife was killed instantly and his daughter sustained full body burns. Saleh lost one eye and was seriously injured in the other, according to one of his sons, who witnessed the incident. CANNOT AFFORD TO RETURN \nThe Ahmeds\u2019 case is not unique. Abdallah, 17, told Reuters his family was forced to return to the town of Jweibeh on Nov. 26 \nA week later masked men arrived at the family home at 2 a.m. demanding to speak to the father. When he refused to open the door, they burst in and started shooting. Abdallah\u2019s father suffered leg injuries and his mother lost a finger. \nThe family do not know what the men wanted. Slideshow (8 Images) \n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to return but it has to be safe,\u201d said Abdallah, who is now the family breadwinner, working at a shop in the city of Falluja. \nFor many it is not economically viable to leave the camps, where they can set up barber shops or fruit stands at makeshift markets, making about $50 a month. \nThat sum would not be possible back home where jobs, basic services, and schools are nonexistent. \n\u201cI can\u2019t afford to return,\u201d said camp resident Alaa Hussein. \nOne man whose father suffers from kidney failure said leaving means losing access to the camp\u2019s dialysis machine. His village, 450 km (280 miles) from the camp, does not have one. \n\u201cI will return once there are adequate health services there, but why should I go before then?\u201d said Jassem Ali, 37. \nFive camp residents told Reuters separately they were forced to leave but had to turn back because checkpoints manned by Iranian-backed Shi\u2018ite militias were demanding bribes of up to $400 to let people through, a sum none could afford. \nThey spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Reuters was unable to independently verify the claim. LIFE RUINED \nA U.S. diplomat in Baghdad said she had heard reports of forced returns, which the embassy had brought to the attention of the Iraqi government. \nShe said the government had stressed its commitment to safe and voluntary returns but also said that \u201cthere is a real desire to get people home as quickly as possible\u201d. \nThe United Nations says more than half of displaced Iraqis have already returned. More than 3.2 million people were back home at the end of December, with 2.6 million still displaced, according to the International Organization for Migration. \nFor Mahdi Ahmed, the government has achieved the reverse of what it intended. \n\u201cThey are doing this because of the election, but if I go back and see my house destroyed, my money gone, and my life ruined, why would I vote for them?\u201d he asked.

You want to know the truth, Dick, if we do this properly, DACA, you're not so far away from comprehensive immigration reform. And if you want to take it that further step, I'll take the heat. I don't care,\" said Trump. \n\"My positions are going to be what the people in this room come up with,\" the president later told the press pool. \"If they come to me with things I'm not in love with, I'm going to do it, because I respect them,\" said the president, flanked by Durbin and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md. \nAfter the meeting Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he wants to handle a DACA solution and and government spending separately. \n\"It is still my view that I will call up a DACA-related immigration bill that I know the president will sign and that it will not be a part of any spending agreement,\" the Kentucky Republican said. \nFollowing the meeting, the White House also released a statement, saying the president and negotiators \"reached an agreement to negotiate legislation that accomplishes critically needed reforms in four high-priority areas: border security, chain migration, the visa lottery, and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy.\" \nTrump stressed that both Democrats and Republicans want to find a way to extend DACA protections, but he stressed that any such bill would need to end preferential immigration status for the family members of immigrants, and cancel the green card lottery program. \nTrump did not put as much emphasis Tuesday on building a wall along the southern border as he has at previous events, although he did mention erecting a barrier along \"a portion\" of it. This, along with his insistence that he would sign on to whatever deal congressional negotiators reach, is potentially a sign of progress in the tense negotiations. \nDemocrats have consistently said that appropriating billions of dollars to build a wall would be a nonstarter for talks, and they have threatened to withhold funding for the government, effectively forcing a shutdown, if Republicans continue to insist on funding for a wall as a condition of protecting approximately 800,000 so-called Dreamers: Undocumented young people who were brought to the United States as children. \nFormer President Barack Obama used an executive order to permit many Dreamers who completed high school to apply for work permits. Trump rescinded that order last fall, and gave Congress six months to come up with a fix before Dreamers would become eligible for deportation. \nThe press pool was permitted to stay in it for nearly an hour, far longer than reporters are usually allowed to film presidential meetings. The tone was collegial but energetic, with lawmakers from both parties taking turns expressing their positions, and Trump playing the role of an informed and engaged moderator. \n\"I know most of the people [in this room] on both sides, have a lot of respect for the people, on both sides, and what I approve is going to be very much reliant on what the people in this room come to me with. I have great confidence in these people,\" Trump said near the close of the meeting. Christina Wilkie Political Reporter for CNBC.com Playing"}

Steve Bannon said Donald Trump \"lost his stuff\"; the president observed of his disheveled ex-strategist: \"Guy looks homeless.\"\nAnd now, politically speaking, he is.\nBreitbart News, the outrage-stoking far-right website that Bannon made his personal power base, cut ties with him today . Bannon's savage portrayal of the White House made the outcome inevitable. In this civil war, Breitbart and its financiers had no choice but to side with the president of the United States.\nThat represents welcome news for Republican Congressional leaders who never shared Bannon's initial enthusiasm for Trump. After being deposed as chief White House strategist a few months ago, Bannon returned to Breitbart and vowed to lead a 2018 insurrection against \"establishment\" Republicans he described as thwarting the president's nationalist \"Make America Great Again\" agenda.\nBannon's insurrection suffered one painful defeat when his candidate for U.S. Senate in Alabama, accused child molester Roy Moore, lost a race Republicans thought they couldn't lose. Now Bannon has lost the backing of the Mercer family's billions that he had counted on for weaponry.\nThat hardly solves the political problems Republicans face this year as they try to hold their House and Senate majorities. Early polling shows Democrats with powerful momentum, despite a strong economy, booming financial markets, and the freshly-enacted tax-cut law.\nThat's partly due to political tides that nearly always recede for the party that holds the White House. And it's partly due to Trump's extraordinary unpopularity, which has repelled key blocs of the electorate including young people, women and college-educated whites.\nA growing number of Republican lawmakers are choosing to retire rather than trying to ride out the 2018 storms. For those vulnerable Republicans intent on staying, strategies for mitigating the damage are limited.\nOne option is distancing themselves from the president, as some embattled members did when Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama faced midterm political troubles. But doing so risks splintering their base with primary challenges from the Trump loyalists on the right, even with Bannon marginalized.\nWolff's book \"Fire and Fury,\" depicting Trump as uninformed, unstable and childlike, has amplified public discussion of the president's fitness for office. \"Never Trump\" conservative intellectuals sought to drive home that message throughout the 2016 campaign, as retiring Republican Sens. Bob Corker and Jeff Flake have in recent months.\nBut so far, neither GOP Congressional leaders nor rank-and-file party loyalists have picked up the theme. Barring devastating developments soon from special counsel Robert Mueller 's Russia investigation, Trump isn't going anywhere.\nAnd that makes the GOP's choice on standing by Trump much like Breitbart's between Bannon and the president: not much of a choice at all."}

Now, the already heated battle is likely to turn red hot as the competition moves to a second round. \nAt stake: a $5 billion facility that will employ 50,000 and boost state coffers by adding billions of dollars in additional investment in the surrounding community over the next 10 to 15 years. \nMany of the finalists were thought to be contenders from the start. They include cities CNBC has already visited as we evaluate the bids: Chicago, Columbus, Ohio; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Denver. But three dark horse candidates join the list: Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and Toronto. The list includes three locations in and around the nation's capital: Washington, DC; the Northern Virginia suburbs, and Montgomery County, Maryland. The area was already receiving buzz based on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' ownership of the Washington Post. Getty Images Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. \nBut failing to make the cut are sentimental favorites like Detroit, which submitted a joint bid with Windsor, Ontario. Also off the list: Houston\u2014Bezos' boyhood home\u2014as well as Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, and Salt Lake City. \n\"Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough \u2014 all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity,\" Holly Sullivan, an executive with Amazon Public Policy, said in a statement. \nA number of factors can help gauge which cities have a chance at this coveted bid. Amazon has stated criteria noting it favors metro areas with 1 million people and a stable, business-friendly environment. It also wants a location with strong local and regional talent \u2014 particularly in software development and related fields \u2014 and a community that thinks \"big and creatively.\" \nAlso included in a request for proposals issued by Amazon in September: convenient access to mass transit and an international airport, a highly educated labor pool, a strong university system and a diverse population. \nNow that Amazon has narrowed down the field, we have done the same in our ongoing analysis of the contenders. And we have added new grades for Los Angeles, Indianapolis, Toronto, and Montgomery County, Maryland. \nOur analysis scores the locations based on Amazon's main criteria\u2014population, stability\/business friendliness, talent, and location\u2014using data from our 2017 America's Top States for Business study and the Census Bureau. Apples-to-apples data for Toronto is tricky, but we used figures from Statistics Canada, Transportation Canada, Ontario's Transportation Ministry, and the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. \nNo one outside of Amazon knows for certain how the company will score things, but our data offers some insight into which finalists have the best chances. First, a look at the new cities on the list: Los Angeles, California Matthew Gush | Stock \/ 360 | Getty Images Skyline of downtown Los Angeles, California \nLos Angeles has the talent, that's for sure. Higher education in the Golden State is outstanding, and Southern California's tech scene is giving Silicon Valley a run for its money. It also would not hurt Amazon's growing studio arm to have a bigger presence near Hollywood. \nBut this is California\u2014notoriously unfriendly in terms of business regulation, though the economy has improved considerably. Making the list of finalists is giving the business community here renewed hope, unless it turns out to be a Hollywood fantasy. Indianapolis, Indiana John J. Miller Photogrpahy | Getty Images Indianapolis, Indiana \nIndianapolis is the capital of the Crossroads of America, and given Amazon's interest in strong infrastructure in its new location, that is not a bad distinction to have. The state economy is strong, stable, and business friendly. But the region lacks some of the options its competitors have when it comes to air travel. \nIndiana also suffers from shortages of workers\u2014particularly the skilled workers Amazon craves. Toronto, Ontario Roberto Machado Noa | LightRocket | Getty Images Canadian flag and the Toronto skyline. \nAmazon had opened its search to locations across North America, but Toronto is the only non-U.S. city to make the cut. But it brings considerable might to the competition. The region far outpaces its American counterparts when it comes to an educated workforce. \nBusiness costs in Canada are tempting\u2014the corporate tax rate is well below the U.S., even after the Trump tax cuts, and the Canadian dollar is cheap. But Toronto suffers some of the same problems as any other big city, including an aging infrastructure. And business regulation in Canada can be far stricter than in the U.S. Montgomery County, Maryland Denis Tangney Jr. | Getty Images Rockville is a city located in the central region of Montgomery County, Maryland. \nWe are grading D.C.'s Maryland suburbs separately from Northern Virginia because Maryland has some different pluses and minuses. On the positive side, the skilled workforce is plentiful here\u2014particularly the all-important STEM workforce. But Maryland is a much less business-friendly state than Virginia. \nIf Amazon is intent on setting up shop in the D.C. area, it may do best in Virginia or the District itself. \nOther cities on the list are already well respected in economic development circles. Making it into Amazon's top 20 is yet another feather in their competitive caps. Denver, Colorado Bridget Calip | Getty Image Denver, Colorado \nEven before any city had submitted a bid, the New York Times in September declared Denver to be the winner. Our analysis is a little less glowing. Yes, the state has a tremendous talent pool, a thriving tech scene, and a business-friendly environment. But the state is dealing with a serious pension problem, which hurts the overall economy. Costs can be high, and the infrastructure needs work. \nGov. John Hickenlooper today gave the following statement on Amazon releasing the list of 20 finalists for its second headquarters. \"It's great to be on Amazon's list of finalists as they consider the location of their second headquarters,\" said Governor John Hickenlooper. \"Colorado is one of the most business-friendly states in America and we believe the Denver region would be a great choice for Amazon.\" Raleigh, North Carolina Sean Pavone | Getty Images Raleigh, North Carolina \nThe capital of the Tar Heel State benefits from a state with one of the best workforces in the country and a heritage of innovation dating back to the Wright Brothers. \n\"When I talk to CEOs about whether they will expand or bring their company to a state, the first thing they talk about is work force and talent,\" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told CNBC in November. \"North Carolina checks all of those boxes for Amazon.\" \nCounting against the state is a lack of mass transportation and a nagging lack of inclusiveness. North Carolina repealed the most controversial parts of its so-called bathroom bill, but it still lacks statewide protections against discrimination and expressly bars them at the local level. North Carolina finished No. 5 in this year's Top States rankings. Atlanta Steve Kelley | Getty Images"}

REUTERS\/Charles Platiau \nAmorepacific, South Korea\u2019s biggest beauty firm, began selling its luxury Sulwhasoo brand of creams and other cosmetic products in Galeries Lafayette department store in Paris in September. \nThierry Maman, the head of the group\u2019s European operations, said its products should reach British department stores, such as Selfridges, this year, with Germany to follow after that. \nMaman, hired by Amorepacific in 2015 from the perfume and beauty arm of LVMH\u2019s ( LVMH.PA ) Givenchy, said the Paris outlet was \u201ca good testing ground\u201d as the label considered whether to open its own stores or offer its products through other shops. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t become international from one day to the next,\u201d he said. \nThe group first tried to break into the French cosmetics market, one of the world\u2019s most competitive, 30 years ago but withdrew after just two years due to poor sales. It bought French perfume house Annick Goutal in 2011. \nMaman said France was a tough market but added Sulwhasoo was betting on drawing customers with its traditional, herbal-inspired formulas. Slideshow (2 Images) \nSouth Korean beauty products, which have expanded in Asia and especially China, have gained a reputation for innovation and using natural ingredients, such as snail slime or tea leaves. \nOther Korean firms have attracted foreign investors and pushed into Europe, such as Dr.Jart+, partly backed by Estee Lauder ( EL.N ) and whose products are sold in the beauty chain Sephora. \nRivals often offer cheaper ranges of skincare or make-up products, which are particularly popular with young consumers. \nAmorepacific, whose products include a sponge applicator for make-up that has been mimicked by global brands like L\u2018Oreal\u2019s ( OREP.PA ) Lancome, might offer more of its middle-of-the-range labels to Europe in future, Maman said. \nAmorepacific\u2019s European revenues, including Goutal, were less than 50 million euros (\u00a344.38 million) annually but were expected to rise by 20 percent in 2018, Maman said. \nAmorepacific\u2019s sales were hit this year by diplomatic tensions with China that reduced Chinese tourists to South Korea. \nRelations are now on the mend, but Amorepacific Corp\u2019s sales fell 8 percent to about 4 trillion won (\u00a32.8 billion) in the year to September.

Prince Williams FilmMagic By Bloomberg 11:59 AM EST \nAs an alternative to customers lining up at sneaker stores fighting for the chance to buy a designer shoe that only a few people have, Mark Gainor and Jimmy Gorecki are offering something even more exclusive: a kick designed for you, and you alone. A post shared by @ no_one_system on Dec 21, 2017 at 5:08pm PST \nGainor, the former creative director of Native Shoes, and Gorecki, a onetime pro skateboarder, founded No.One in February 2017 in Venice, Calif. The luxury startup creates custom-made and extremely limited-edition sneakers using traditional shoemaking techniques. \nNo.One employs a crew of four cobblers in the company\u2019s small studio\u2014a size that allows for creative flexibility and attention to bespoke commissions, which in recent months have included sneakers made from impala fur, as well as a waterproof pair reconstructed from a Gore-Tex military jacket. Gainor and Gorecki have found fans among a steady flow of actors, musicians, and sports icons, including 2017 NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant. A post shared by @ no_one_system on Nov 21, 2017 at 5:34pm PST \nAlongside these unique creations, the team also works on small batches of production-run models, producing from 14 to 17 pairs in three classic silhouettes, with prices starting at $575 a pair. The process of creating each run takes roughly two weeks, and with each release, typically only a couple of pairs in each size are made available. \n\u201cTo us, No.One is very much a post-skateboarding shoe,\u201d says Gainor. \u201cNot only in the physical sense, but in the larger sense of finding a home and platform for the DIY values and culture from growing up in skateboarding.\u201d \nIn a sneaker market so focused on high-tech fabrics, and new and innovative manufacturing processes, the idea of a handcrafted, customized sneaker stands out. Each pair of No.One sneakers is hand-lasted, a process that\u2019s identical to what John Lobb or any other classic bespoke shoemaker would use\u2014and one that can\u2019t be rivaled by more modern, mass-production slip lasting or machine lasting. A post shared by @ no_one_system on Nov 8, 2017 at 5:48pm PST \nFor its premium materials, No.One works with a small group of luxury tanneries, each specialized in a specific product, and most often family-owned. For its sneaker linings, plong\u00e9 lambskin is sourced from a Chanel-owned tannery in the south of France\u2014the same skin that lines many of the luxury brand\u2019s handbags. \nGainor points to the leather counters (a piece near the heel) as indicative of the attention to detail that ensures a pair of No.Ones will long outlast any trendy pair of Yeezys exposed to the same amount of wear. \u201cThese leather supports are never seen, but we hand-cut, hand-skive, and wet-mold them out of Italian vegetable-tanned leather,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s hours of detailed craft for each pair of shoes for something that will never be seen, but will be felt for the life of the sneaker.\u201d \nSo far the brand has created three distinct silhouettes\u2014the Alpha desert boot, the Bravo low sneaker, and most recently the cap-toed Charlie. No.One\u2019s plan is to create a comprehensive line that runs 26 models strong, one for each letter of the alphabet, while still satisfying the ever-growing demand for fully customized service. \nWWD fashion director Alex Badia says No.One has figured out how to sell a personalized experience to consumers who\u2019ve grown tired of settling for the immediacy of an off-the-shelf purchase. \u201cThe modern menswear consumer has become much more savvy in recent years,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a growing appreciation for the process that comes with commissioning bespoke fashion, and a better understanding of the time and costs involved.\u201d SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}
{"published":"2018-01-03T12:45:00.000+02:00","title":"Brainstorm Health: Health Industry Drivers, Spark Blindness Drug Price, ALS Gene Therapy | Fortune","text":"10:45 AM EST \nGood morning, Dailies, and thank you for beginning another year with us in your mailbox. \nAs I mentioned in yesterday\u2019s note, I spent much of the holiday break pondering the big ideas and trends that are going to drive the healthcare revolution in the coming few years. And over the next several weekdays, I\u2019ll share them all in this newsletter. At the heart of each, however, is really one big idea: value . To put it in the argot of Middle-earth, it\u2019s the one idea to rule them all. \nIn an essay for the New England Journal of Medicine some seven years ago, the eminent management scholar Michael Porter famously asked, \u201c What Is Value in Health Care? \u201d His answer can be summed up in two paragraphs, which I\u2019ve stolen below: \nValue should always be defined around the customer, and in a well functioning health care system, the creation of value for patients should determine the rewards for all other actors in the system. Since value depends on results, not inputs, value in health care is measured by the outcomes achieved, not the volume of services delivered, and shifting focus from volume to value is a central challenge. Nor is value measured by the process of care used; process measurement and improvement are important tactics but are no substitutes for measuring outcomes and costs. \nSince value is defined as outcomes relative to costs, it encompasses efficiency. Cost reduction without regard to the outcomes achieved is dangerous and self-defeating, leading to false \u201csavings\u201d and potentially limiting effective care. \nThese central tenets, I believe, will continue to propel the healthcare transformation that is now underway\u2014even if you can\u2019t quite see the impact yet. (I\u2019ll have more on that in a future commentary.) Science and technology will be the tools that carry us forward, inevitably, but it is this driving idea\u2014of customer-centered value\u2014that will spur the most meaningful changes in the realms of healthcare systems and medical technology. \nFor some of the trends and themes that I\u2019ll discuss over the next week or so (including the two below) you\u2019ll see that customer value is clearly at the core. In others, recent breakthroughs in science and technology are leading to quick adoption of a medical innovation or approach, which in turn, is helping to drive more investment in the field and creating a virtuous cycle. But even with these trends, I believe, consumer and patient value lies at the center of gravity. \nWith that said, here are the first two major health industry drivers for 2018: 1. SELF-AGGREGATION. \nStep away from the healthcare universe for a moment and consider a phenomenon that has dominated public chatter these past many months: Bitcoin. For all the prognosticating and opining about Bitcoin mania\u2014and we do a fair amount of both in FORTUNE \u2019s January cover story ( please read !)\u2014there is one aspect of the cryptocurrency that I believe can teach us something important about the future of healthcare: Bitcoin and its coinish ilk are self-organizing systems that operate utterly outside the traditional structures and rules of financial engagement. Normally, when we think of money\u2014the dollar, the euro, the yuan, whatever\u2014we think of governments, and central banks, and mints printing up paper bills behind fortified walls. Bitcoin and its rivals have none of those things\u2014and, it turns out, they don\u2019t need them to function. \nYou might even say the same thing about the Internet\u2014though, to see the parallels with Bitcoin, it helps to stroll back to New Year\u2019s Day 1983. That\u2019s when the pioneering developers of ARPANET adopted a set of communications protocols called TCP\/IP, allowing a community of computer scientists, academic researchers, and others to create a self-organized system for sending messages and data. Here, in effect, was another universe built from scratch, with its own set of governing rules and conventions. \nThe question is whether healthcare can likewise be wrenched free from its rigid, decades-old payment and provider constructs and be re-formed into new self-contained, efficiently run ecosystems that put the consumer at the center. I believe the answer is yes\u2014and that we\u2019ll start seeing business models (both for-profit and not-for-profit) emerge and evolve around this idea. \nIndeed, the early makings of such an ecosystem can be seen, to some extent, in Kaiser Permanente , which integrates coverage and care for its nearly 12 million policyholders. KP still works through a traditional network of hospitals and medical offices in a smattering of states\u2014with 23,000 non-employee physicians offering care exclusively through its own health plans. But within this healthcare biodome, the old rules of insurance, copays, appointment-making, and office visits are changing quickly, as customers now routinely consult with their physicians through email exchanges and video chats. \nThe recent move by CVS to acquire Aetna in a nearly $70 billion deal is another step toward self-aggregation, combining a retail pharmacy chain, a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM), and an insurer under one roof\u2014and I doubt they\u2019re done building by any stretch. Look for this health combine in the coming year or two to absorb one or more physicians groups, and maybe enrich CVS\u2019s in-store \u201c Minute Clinics \u201d with an independent network of neighborhood walk-in centers as well. UnitedHealth Group has been on the same path. Last month it announced it was buying DaVita Medical Group for nearly $5 billion\u2014a union that would give UnitedHealth some 300 clinics around the country, bolstering its current associated network of 30,000 physicians. (Both deals are subject to regulatory approval.) \nWhat will continue to drive self-aggregation, however, isn\u2019t the same thing that has driven consolidation in the past\u2014that is, to find cost savings through \u201cnew efficiencies\u201d (a worn conceit that rarely produces what it claims to). The aim, again, is (or ought to be) to create an ecosystem\u2014one strong enough, and independent enough, to write its own rules. And if those rules ultimately benefit patients, providing more value at less cost, then the system will thrive. Otherwise, these new multibillion-dollar constructs will collapse under their own weight. 2. DE-HOSPITALIZATION. \nWhat are already collapsing under their own weight are many hospitals. As the always-incisive Bryan Roberts, framed it for me in a conversation around this time last year , hospitals \u201care essentially big capital assets trying to stuff people through them.\u201d These often-gargantuan, sprawling structures are filled from floor to ceiling with fixed costs\u2014pricey beds, CT scanners, MRIs, and other giant machines, nursing staffs, laboratories, etc. And while, for many decades, capital assets such as these were a strategic advantage for hospitals, says Roberts, \u201cwe are entering a time, because of the liquidity of data and analytics and software, when\u2026all of those capital assets are now actually really constraining. Obviously, they cost a lot of money and depress margins. But I think they could also dramatically constrain business models, too.\u201d \nTo keep their inefficient 12-cylinder engines chugging, hospitals must consume a ton of financial fuel\u2014roughly $1.1 trillion of national spending"}

Not this year. \nAs techies swarm Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show, the world's biggest internet company is squarely out to capture their attention. It's created a giant \"playground\" in the parking lot of one of the convention centers, complete with a slide and a faux gumball machine. \nThe words \"Hey Google\" \u2014 used by consumers to ask questions of the voice-powered Google Assistant \u2014 are plastered on multiple casinos as well as the monorail that whisks attendees between conferences halls. CNBC A gigantic gumball machine as part of Google's display at the 2018 CES. \nGoogle isn't explicitly saying it, but the company is spending all this promotional money in an aggressive push to take on a single rival: Amazon. \nOn Monday, Google announced a slew of new products and updates for Assistant, its artificial intelligence software that lives on a range of devices like Home smart speakers. \nGoogle debuted partnerships with JBL, Lenovo, LG, and Sony to launch new, Assistant-powered \"smart displays\" equipped with front-facing cameras that will let users watch media and make video calls, similar to Amazon's Echo Show. \nSince Amazon launched the $230 Show last spring, both Google and Facebook have reportedly been working on their own versions. It now appears that Google will be leaving the hardware production to partners, at least at first. \nGoogle also announced that it will start referring to Assistant's capabilities as \"Actions,\" akin to how Amazon has \"Skills\" for Alexa. \nThey're not perfectly analogous. Google's Actions include asking your Assistant for directions using Maps, as well as features enabled through third parties, while Amazon's Skills only refer to Alexa voice apps built by third-party developers. \nAmazon recently said that Alexa has over 30,000 Skills while Google just announced that Assistant can perform more than 1 million \"Actions.\" Users can search for Actions via a newly launched directory page. \nIf you've been following the news blasting out of CES at all, then you've probably noticed the trend -- companies are building smart assistants into everything, including ovens and refrigerators , countless new headphones and speakers, and cars. \nGoogle said on Monday that new partners will be launching Assistant-optimized headphones this year and that Assistant is coming to the more than 400 car models that already run its Android Auto operating system. Meanwhile, Panasonic announced this morning that, alongside Assistant, it was launching Alexa Onboard, which lets users interact with Alexa in their cars, even when there is no network connection. #Google going all out to promote its AI personal assistant at #CES2018 .

According to the latest CIRP estimates, Amazon's Echo products controlled 76 percent market of the U.S. home smart speaker market compared with 24 percent for Google's Home devices. \nFor the next few days, the two companies are taking their battle for the living room to the CES showroom.

In his resignation speech, Franken alluded to wanting a woman to replace him, telling the Senate, \u201cMinnesotans deserve a senator who can focus with all her energy on addressing the challenges they face every day.\u201d \n\u201cGiven what\u2019s happened in the current moment, the issue of sexual assault \u2026it\u2019s just making all of this stand out even more. To see a woman step up and take the place of a man thats been accused and is resigning because of his own history with sexual harassment,\u201d said Jean Sinzdak, associate director at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \nSinzdak noted that the number of women serving in the Senate are still not where she wants them to be \u2014 which would be 50-50 representation \u2014 but highlighted the progress that has been made over the past decade. \n\u201cTen years ago, we were at 16 [women in the Senate] and even 20 years ago we had fewer than 10 women serving in the Senate,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would like to be a lot closer to parity, but it is a pretty rapid number of women entering the Senate in the last couple of decades.\u201d \nSmith will join Amy Klobuchar in the Senate, making Minnesota the fourth state to be represented by two female senators. Three other states \u2014 California, Washington and New Hampshire \u2014 in the current Senate have two female Senators, but this is a first for Minnesota. \nThe number of Senate women had previously reached a record high in January of 2017 when four women senators \u2014 Illinois\u2019 Tammy Duckworth, Nevada\u2019s Catherine Cortez-Masto, California\u2019s Kamala Harris and New Hampshire\u2019s Maggie Hassan \u2014 were sworn in. \nThere is a possibility this current record of female Senators could be fleeting. Twelve are up for reelection in 2018, including Smith whose race is currently considered a toss-up. \nBut Sinzdak said she is confident women will continue to smash electoral records \u2014 both in the Senate and beyond \u2014 noting that a record of women have expressed interest in running for office this cycle. \n\u201cIt could be very easily a record breaking year for women all over the country in all types of elections,\u201d she said.

He was found guilty by a jury in October of violating federal truth in lending and racketeering laws.\nTucker did not make a statement at his sentencing, referring instead to a letter he submitted to the court in December. In that letter, Tucker said he was \u201cremorseful\u201d for \u201cthe misperception that I do not recognize my responsibility to live as a good and fair business man, employer, and American citizen.\u201d\nCastel said the letter showed Tucker had not accepted that his conduct was criminal.\n\u201cThe notion that Mr. Tucker is just an honest businessman doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d he said.\nTucker\u2019s lawyer, Lee Ginsburg, said he would appeal.\nCastel also sentenced Timothy Muir, 46, a lawyer who worked with Tucker and was convicted of the same charges in October, to seven years in prison. Muir\u2019s lawyer, Thomas Bath, could not immediately be reached for comment.\nTucker and Muir were indicted in February 2016 amid efforts by the federal government to crack down on abuses by payday lending companies.\nSuch companies say they help consumers by offering small loans that are to be repaid in a short time, often from the person\u2019s next paycheck, but critics say they exploit borrowers through high interest rates and fees.\nProsecutors said Tucker\u2019s Kansas-based business, which operated under names including Ameriloan and OneClickCash, routinely charged interest rates as high as 700 percent, exploiting more than 4 million people from 1997 to 2013.\nAfter several states brought lawsuits over the lending, prosecutors said, Tucker entered into sham relationships with Native American tribes. By claiming his companies were owned by tribes, prosecutors said, Tucker was able to shield the companies from lawsuits using tribal sovereign immunity.\nTucker, who has competed on U.S. and European racing circuits, was previously convicted of making a false statement to obtain a bank loan and of running a fraudulent financial services business. He was sentenced in 1991 to a year in a federal prison for the latter crime.\nTucker was also charged in Kansas last month with filing a false tax return.

That could boost the dollar as companies move money out of local currencies and into dollars. \nApple has $250 billion overseas, and it announced plans to pay taxes of $38 billion on money it holds offshore. \nBank of America equity strategists, in a separate note Thursday, said there is $1.2 trillion overseas cash in non-financial companies, and tech companies and health care are two sectors where there will be a lot of cash returned. Repatriation of foreign profits has been mandated as part of tax reform legislation, and the BofA currency strategist said they expect companies to move sooner rather than later to bring it home. \nTo be sure, some strategists do not see much currency impact because they argue these companies already have this foreign money in dollar-denominated assets. Plus, the companies are not required to bring the money they repatriated physically home. \nBut Bank of America believes they will and sees up to $400 billion worth of U.S. dollar flows. \n\"Repatriation of accumulated earnings held overseas in local currency by US corporates the result of tax reform passage could result in up to $400 [billion] worth of USD inflows according to our estimates.

The Washington Post matched that story, citing two sources.\nMueller himself learned about the president's withdrawn directive in recent months, according to the Times.\n\"We decline to comment out of respect for the Office of the Special Counsel and its process,\" Ty Cobb, an attorney for the president, said in a statement to the Times.\nWhen asked about the report\nAt the World Economic Forum at Davos on Friday, Trump scoffed at the report. \"Fake news, folks, fake news,\" he told reporters when asked about it.\nMueller is investigating Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. The probe has dogged and frustrated Trump, and has also moved into whether the president has obstructed the investigation.\nOthers suggested last year that the president was thinking about firing Mueller, with one ally telling PBS in June that Trump was \"considering perhaps terminating the special counsel. I think he's weighing that option.\"\nIn August, however, the president claimed he had never even considered firing the special counsel. \"I haven't given it any thought. I mean, I've been reading about it from you people. You say, 'Oh, I'm going to dismiss him.' No, I'm not dismissing anybody.

{"published":"2018-01-04T22:57:00.000+02:00","title":"Fidelity retirement funds take multiyear hit from commodities bet","text":"BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments\u2019 bet on commodities for its flagship retirement funds has declined 38 percent over the past five years, while top rivals have avoided the sector altogether or made money with more-conservative strategies.\nThe Boston-based company inserted its new Fidelity Series Commodity Strategy Fund into its Freedom Funds in 2009 to diversify their portfolios from stocks and bonds while giving them a weapon against inflation. But U.S. inflation has been weak for years, while stocks have been surging.\nRealized losses in the Commodity Strategy Fund have totaled $3.26 billion since 2012, according to its financial statements. In that time, energy prices collapsed, gold and silver prices declined, and bouts of excess supply plagued the coffee and sugar markets, according to Fidelity\u2019s disclosures.\nThe fund invests in futures contracts that cover commodities such as hogs, oil and wheat, as well as swaps with counterparties such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co, according to U.S. regulatory filings.\nEven with the commodity funds\u2019 losses, returns for Freedom Funds, which dial down risk as investors approach their estimated target date for retirement, exceeded those of more than 90 percent of peers because of larger, winning bets on stocks, according to three-year performance data from research firm Morningstar Inc.\nFidelity\u2019s allocation to commodities in the Freedom Funds is $4 billion, or nearly 2 percent of $224 billion in net assets. That is down from highs of $12 billion and up to 10 percent of assets in some of the most aggressive Freedom Fund portfolios in 2013.\nMorningstar analyst Jeff Holt said some managers of target-date retirement funds had lost patience with their commodities bets.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a multiyear bull market for equities, and diversification from that doesn\u2019t look that great,\u201d Holt said.\nFidelity said in a statement that it was sticking with its commodities strategy as its portfolio managers take a long-term view.\n\u201cThe target date team has confidence in all of the investment strategies that are included in the portfolios,\u201d the company said.\nAnd the tide could be turning for commodities. The commodity fund eked out a 0.92 percent gain in 2017 as energy prices rallied during the second half of the year. Oil rose to its highest since May 2015 on Thursday, helped by large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded as high as $68.27.\nUnlike Fidelity, target-date portfolios managed by T. Rowe Price Group Inc use a fund with no direct exposure to commodities. Instead of investing in futures contracts like the Fidelity commodity fund does, T. Rowe primarily buys shares of publicly traded companies that own or are involved in natural resources, precious metals or real estate, spokesman Bill Weeks said.\nThe surging stock market is one reason why the $3.3 billion T. Rowe Real Assets Fund has generated an average annual return of 3.07 percent over the past five years, compared with average annual losses of 9.07 percent for Fidelity\u2019s commodity fund, according to Morningstar.\nVanguard Group, the largest target-date fund provider, does not invest in commodities for those retirement portfolios. The increased costs and complexity associated with commodities outweigh their benefits, said Senior Investment Analyst Scott Donaldson.\n\u201cPeople may think because they own commodities, they own barrels of oil and bushels of wheat,\u201d Donaldson said. \u201cBut what they really own are financial derivatives. These can be complex, confusing and expensive.\u201d\nReporting by Tim McLaughlin; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n "}

If you had invested in Disney itself 10 years ago, you might be partaking in some of that happiness, too.\nFinancial website How Much took a look at some popular American stocks from ten years ago to find out how much a $1,000 investment in each would be worth now. It estimates that a $1,000 investment in Disney in 2007 would be worth $2,824 as of October 31.\nDisney's performance came in just shy of Google's holding company, Alphabet's.\nIn the graphic below, the blue dots are equivalent to a $1,000 initial investment, and the pink dots equal the investment's current total value. \"The larger the pink circle, the more your investment is worth,\" according to How Much. \"If the pink fits inside the blue, then you lost money. The [graphic] assumes that you took any dividend paid out in cash and did not reinvest into the company by buying more stock.\"\nRemember, any individual stock can over- or under-perform . However, some Wall Street execs feel optimistic about Disney's announcement that it will buy parts of Twenty-First Century Fox in a deal worth $52.4 billion in stock.\nAmong other acquisitions, the company will take on Fox's movie studios, networks Nat Geo and FX, and stakes in Hulu and regional sports networks. The deal will also give Disney more content as it plans to launch its own streaming service to compete with services like Netflix , whose stock proved to be an even better bet over the past decade.\nDisney also plans to launch a stand-alone ESPN digital service.\nThe company \"remains best positioned in the current fragmented media landscape to leverage its content across a growing number of distribution channels, its global theme parks and consumer products,\" according to Stan Meyers, vice president and senior research analyst at investment bank and asset management firm Piper Jaffray.\nInvestors and entertainment stars alike are taking notice. Most recently, American rapper Kanye West bought his wife, reality TV star and entrepreneur Kim Kardashian, stocks in major companies such as Netflix , Amazon , Apple and Adidas. The bundle included 920 shares of Disney , worth about $100,000, according to Kardashian's Instagram.\nIf you're looking to invest in a company yourself or pass on shares to a loved one, since they can make great gifts , begin carefully and remember that past returns do not predict future results. Experienced investors Warren Buffett, Mark Cuban and Tony Robbins suggest you start with index funds .\nIndex funds hold every stock in an index such as the S&P 500, including big-name brands such as Microsoft and Google, and offer low turnover rates, attendant fees and tax bills.

( tmsnrt.rs\/2hGom21 )\nSignificantly, the U.S. drug tally of 46 does not include the first of a new wave of cell and gene therapies from Novartis, Gilead Sciences and Spark Therapeutics that were approved in 2017 under a separate category.\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has hailed these products as \u201ca whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases\u201d. However, there is debate as to how cash-strapped healthcare systems will pay for them.\nFILE PHOTO: Pharmaceutical tablets and capsules are arranged on a table in this picture illustration taken in Ljubljana August 20, 2014. REUTERS\/Srdjan Zivulovic \/File Photo Under Gottlieb, the FDA has taken advantage of policy changes implemented in recent years to accelerate the drug approval process.\nProcedures such as the agency\u2019s \u201cbreakthrough therapy\u201d designation have cut review times and helped to stimulate competition by adding multiple new drugs that often work in a similar way.\nA wide choice of medicines with the same mechanism of action can be a double-edged sword for manufacturers, since it gives insurers and governments ammunition to drive down prices.\nPfizer and Merck\u2019s new diabetes drug Steglatro, for example, was the fourth product of its kind to win a green light in the United States, while Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic was the sixth of its type. Both were approved in December.\nIn cancer, AstraZeneca\u2019s Imfinzi was the fifth medicine to target a key protein found on the body\u2019s immune cells when it won approval last May.\nFor the current year, companies have more new products waiting in the wings, although the pace of FDA approvals may be tempered by the fact that several drugs that had been expected to be cleared in the first quarter of 2018 were actually approved in 2017.\nIn Europe, meanwhile, the focus will be on any disruption or delays to the approval process as the European Medicines Agency prepares to relocate from London to Amsterdam as a result of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union.\nReporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Keith Weir\n "}

During that time, South Korean officials would sometimes use a bull horn to shout messages across the border. \nFor the first time in nearly two years, the hotline was used on Wednesday. On the orders of leader Kim Jong Un, a North Korean official called the South in a preliminary step to a formal dialogue. \nOfficials have released few details of that conversation and several others that have since occurred, although some were decidedly anticlimactic. \nAfter several calls on Wednesday, a North Korean official called to check the line. When the South\u2019s officer asked if the North had anything new to say, the official on the other end of the line said \u201cno\u201d and hung up, according to the Ministry of Unification. \nBut by Friday, the conversations paid off, officials said, with North Korea officially accepting the South\u2019s invitation for formal, face-to-face talks next week on North Korean participation at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea next month. \nThe phone line used to arrange the talks dates to the 1970s, with the current phone installed in 2009, the ministry said. \nPhotos of the phone show a large, wood-panelled console set into a desktop. \nThe system features a computer screen, disk drives, and USB ports, as well as two telephone handsets, one red and one green. \nNo other numbers can be called - the phones use a dedicated line between rooms on the two sides. \n\u201cThe red phone is for incoming calls from North Korea and South Korea uses the green phone to make outgoing calls to the North,\u201d a unification ministry spokeswoman said. \u201cWe have installed two phones just in case one breaks or something.\u201d \nThe Unification Ministry employees who man the phones on the South side are experts in diplomatic protocol and have in the past played roles in face-to-face talks as well. \n\u201cAt first sight it may seem a very simple job,\u201d the senior ministry official said. \u201cBut actually it\u2019s a very delicate job because they are not only in charge of the Panmunjom line but when inter-Korean meetings are held, they are also dispatched to the venue as a contact point between the two sides.\u201d \nWhile the phone operators are discouraged from making any jokes about official issues during their conversations, they have in the past built a personal relationship with their counterparts during periods of close communication. \n\u201cAs they man the position for a long time, they would talk to each other frequently and therefore naturally foster some personal rapport,\u201d the official said. \nLess is known about the North Koreans on the other end of the line. A South Korean liaison officer who engaged in some of the recent conversations said he has never seen his counterparts\u2019 office on the other side, and referred further questions to the Unification Ministry.

{"published":"2018-01-08T22:40:00.000+02:00","title":"Oprah can most help the Democrats as a 'queenmaker'\u2014Commentary","text":"After her stirring speech at the Golden Globes award ceremony Sunday night, the idea of Oprah Winfrey running for president in 2020 is once again gaining steam.\nThere are now even reports that she is seriously considering the idea .\nThe outpouring of support for Oprah in the hours since her speech is a testament to just how popular and powerful she is as a celebrity and a spokesperson for any given cause.\nNow, the hashtag #Oprah2020 is out there, pushing her to take on President Donald Trump in the next election.\nCould she win?\nThere is no denying Oprah could be a formidable opponent. She scores the highest possible marks for name recognition, financial backing (from her own large fortune), and she has a dedicated base of support. People have been speculating about the possibility of her running since last year.\nBut we still have no examples of Oprah speaking for herself as a candidate or attacking a political opponent, which flex different muscles than pushing causes, businesses or movies. It's a key difference between her and President Donald Trump, who had spent years promoting himself and launching attacks on his political opponents long before he became an official candidate.\nThat's the key difference that Winfrey and the Democrats should focus on if they want to take full advantage of her powerful and proven assets. The better key to victory for the Democratic Party in 2020 isn't in Oprah the candidate, but Oprah the promoter.\nOprah can make a book a best-seller in an instant. She can make a reviled celebrity likable with just one special interview. Most importantly, she can help a relative newcomer to national politics overtake a prohibitive favorite to win a presidential nomination.\nWe know that last part because that's what Oprah did for then-Sen. Barack Obama in the years between his big 2004 Democratic National Convention speech and his eventually successful 2008 primary run against Hillary Clinton. In September 2006, Oprah went public with her support for Obama for president for the first time. A month later, she featured him and his book \"The Audacity of Hope\" on her show. For the record, this was all five months before he officially announced his candidacy.\nA detailed study of Oprah's involvement in Obama's campaign concluded that her support was worth 1 million primary votes and made the difference in his winning the nomination in 2008.\nIn short, what we really know about Oprah Winfrey and politics is that she is a powerful kingmaker. Or, to use a term than may be more accurate for 2020, she's a very likely \"queenmaker.\" In that capacity, Oprah can be a real savior for a Democratic Party that still lacks a list of any serious contenders for president in 2020.\nDoes anyone seriously doubt that Oprah could make people like Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris household names in an instant? Does anyone doubt that she could make someone like Sen. Elizabeth Warren seem more likable and human? Does anyone doubt that she could still boost a male candidate like Sen. Cory Booker 's chances? If anyone does doubt it, they really shouldn't.\nWith that in mind, if you're looking to identify the most ambitious and smart Democrats in America today, look for the ones who make a point of meeting with Oprah and publicly asking for her support. Whomever the Democrats choose to run in 2020 will still have to be more persuasive than Trump to win. But getting Oprah's support as early as possible is a great way to prove anyone's persuasive chops.\nThe alternative is that Oprah and the Democrats go out on much thinner ice and bet on her directly. That's a bet that threatens her brand and also would basically confirm that the Democratic Party is basically irrelevant. After all, if a party demands no actual political experience or dues-paying to gain its highest level of support, what's the point of a political party in the first place?\nThe good news for the Democrats is that the longer Oprah's name gets bandied around as a possible presidential candidate, the more valuable her endorsement will be in a year or so when the serious running begins.\nOprah the candidate is iffy both for her personally and the Democrats as a party. But Oprah the powerful and influential party placeholder is almost a sure winner for both.\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

The Dow rose 0.42 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.83 percent and the Nasdaq 1.5 percent.\nThe gains in riskier assets came as industry surveys from India to Germany to Canada showed quickening activity.\n\u201cThe breadth of the recovery is extraordinary,\u201d said Deutsche Bank macro strategist Alan Ruskin, noting that of 31 countries covered, only three failed to show growth while all the largest manufacturing sectors improved.\nElsewhere, spot gold reached its highest since mid-September at $1,321.33, before edging back to $1,313.81 per ounce.\nOil prices hit their highest since mid-2015, only to stall when major pipelines in Libya and the UK restarted and U.S production soared to the strongest in more than four decades.\nBrent crude futures was trading flat at $66.57 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures CLc1 nudged up 7 cents to $60.43 a barrel.

The Sapphire Gentleman's Club, a strip club right off Vegas's main drag, paid to showcase the robots as a way to drum up interest from press and customers.\nAs a first-time CES attendee, the gimmick worked on me: What could be more CES than pole-dancing robots?\nThe robots were as advertised: They gyrated on a stripper pole to music from 50 Cent and Pharrell, with dollar bills scattered on the stage and the floor. A half-dozen human dancers, most of whom were dressed in tight, shiny robot costumes, repeatedly took pics in front of their metallic colleagues. (The woman greeting guests as I walked in told me that I missed a skit where the human dancers unveiled the robot dancers to Star Wars music, and then joked about them stealing their jobs.)\nThe robots look nothing like actual humans, thank God. They had CCTV security cameras for faces, and you could see their metal interiors and wires as they moved up and down the pole. (They were, however, wearing high heels.)\nshow chapters Take a home tour with a robot 3:46 PM ET Mon, 18 Dec 2017 | 01:08 And unlike many of the big tech gimmicks you'll hear about this week from CES, the robot pole-dancers aren't courtesy of a massive multibillion-dollar corporation. They're the work of an artist named Giles Walker, a 50-year-old Brit who describes himself as a scrap metal artist with a passion for building animatronic robots. One of his other projects, The Last Supper, features 13 robots interacting around a table.\nWalker says he got the idea for pole-dancing robots more than seven years ago, when he noticed the rise of CCTV cameras being used as a way to surveil people in Britain for safety purposes, what he called \"mechanical peeping Toms.\" He was inspired by the idea of voyeurism, or watching others for pleasure, and decided to try and turn the cameras into something sexy on their own.\n\"There's a challenge,\" he said from a back table at the Sapphire Club, his robotic creations gyrating some 30 feet away. \"I think if you're a painter, you might want to paint a beautiful woman and make it beautiful. I'm a sculptor, and I wanted to do something that was sexy.\"\nHis robots have become a hit, and not just at CES ( this viral tweet from December certainly helped).\nWalker says he'll rent them out for corporate parties \u2014 usually \"full of men in shirts,\" he says \u2014 and referred to the robots as his \"Christmas jingle,\" which help pay the bills in a profession where money isn't always easy to come by.\nBut while pole-dancing robots might have been just a silly side effect of CES a few years ago, tech's recent grappling with the industry's obvious issues of sexism and gender disparity now put stripper robots in a very different light. CES has already been called out for a lack of gender diversity, and some see dancing robots as yet another example of an chauvinist industry lacking self-awareness.\nshow chapters Meet the robot butler who lives in this luxury L.A. high-rise 2:45 PM ET Thu, 7 Dec 2017 | 01:04 Walker, for his part, sees different concerns with his creations. The rise of human-like robots is coming, he says, and bringing them into the sex industry will be particularly problematic.\n\"They will invent the sex robot,\" Walker said. \"Everyone's striving to do it. I've been approached as well, but I think it's a really dark area. I'm loath to go there.\"\n\"My worry is \u2014 and this is really crude, but it is a crude idea \u2014 if you build a robot that you can have sex with, then you can build a robot that you can rape, and you can build a child robot that you can have sex with, and it's all supposedly legal,\" Walker continued. \"But [just] because it's legal, does that mean it's a healthy thing? The dark side of the sex industry will create some really nasty, nasty stuff, and I think, 'Is it worth it?'\"\nWalker is now dealing with the reality that his creations are indeed associated with sex, and while he may not like where the industry is headed, it can be difficult to get out altogether.\n\"I didn't build these to get involved in the sex industry. They weren't about sex, they were about voyeurism,\" he added. \"I've been dragged into this side of things unintentionally, but I'm not complaining. It does pay the bills. I am a robot pimp in that way.\""}

Alpine skiers fly through the air for five seconds. Figure skaters complete three twirls in a breath. \nDuring the 2018 Winter Olympics , which kick off in a month, athletes will have a handful of very brief moments to show the world what they have spent their lifetimes training for. \nThat means pressure. \nIf you think Olympians are impervious to pressure, according to mental coach Graham Betchart , you're wrong. \"Every human being feels these feelings,\" he tells CNBC Make It . What the best do is take the necessary steps to thrive, rather than fold, when that moment finally arrives. Source: Graham Betchart Mental coach Graham Betchart \nSince receiving his masters in sports psychology from John F. Kennedy University in 2008, Betchart hashelped train countless athletes in mental toughness, including UFC fighters, NFL players and three recent NBA No. 1 draft picks \u2014 the Philadelphia 76ers' Ben Simmons, as well as the Minnesota Timberwolves' Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins. He's currently designing the mental training program for U.S.A. Basketball's youth program. \nHere are the three steps, he says, that Olympians take to perform in a pressure situation: 1. Get comfortable being uncomfortable \n\"You have to find a way to get into the moment, get into your body, trust your training,\" he says, \"even though literally everything is on the line and the entire world is watching.\" This is where the training comes in, because it takes years of preparation to stay calm in uncomfortable situations. Alain Grosclaude\/Agence Zoom | Getty Images Lindsey Vonn of USA competes during the Alipine Ski World Cup Women's Super G on December 16, 2017 in France \n\"If you've never experienced feeling a little vulnerable or being uncomfortable, and you've always resisted that feeling... that's going to sabotage your performance,\" says Betchart. \nSo don't resist. \"Welcome it in,\" says Betchart. \"Then what you find is: What your afraid of is not as big a deal. What makes it a big deal resisting it.\" \nThe sports psychologist offers one anecdote from a personal experience. \"Before my wife gave birth, I'm not telling her everything's going to feel great,\" he says. Instead, he told her: \"You know the deal. This is a legendary uncomfortable moment. But if you embrace it, that takes away the panic, the anxiety and the fear. You're still going to be uncomfortable, but you don't have the anxiety. And that allows you to perform.\" 2. Reframe your feelings \nBeing okay with a discomfort is one thing, but, to take this a step further and truly thrive under pressure, you need to reframe what you are feeling in a positive light. \"Reframing is everything,\" says Betchart. \n\"The really good basketball players have told themselves it's not nervousness [that they're feeling]. They've told themselves it's excitement and joy.\" show chapters "}

The operation would take a few days to complete. \nRukban lies within a 55 km so-called deconfliction zone set by the U.S. Pentagon designed to ensure the safety of a U.S. garrison near the Syrian town of Tanf close to the Iraqi-Syrian border. \nJordan\u2019s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said recently the country, already burdened with hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war-torn Syria, could not be made responsible for delivering aid to the camp. \n\u201cThis is a Syrian international problem and not Jordanian. The inhabitants of the area are Syrians present on Syrian territory and the U.N. can meet their demands from inside Syria,\u201d Safadi said. \nThe kingdom wants the U.N. and global powers to put pressure on Damascus to give the written authorizations needed to allow supplies into Rukban, where the eastern border area leading to the camp is now in government hands. \n\u201cThe only impediment now to supplies being delivered is the Syrian regime and pressure should be applied on it to help its own people,\u201d a Jordanian diplomatic official who asked not to be named told Reuters. \nWashington also assured Amman conditions on the ground were no obstruction to delivery of aid into the \u201cdeconfliction\u201d zone from Syria with Russian consent. \nIn the last two years tens of thousands of people seeking shelter in the camp had fled Russian and coalition airstrikes against former Islamic State-held areas in central and eastern Syria. They trekked south across the desert to the Jordanian border, according to U.N. aid workers. \nKing Abdullah had said there were militants among them and Jordan refused to allow them to enter on security grounds.

The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed the measure last week. Although Vermont is one of the most politically liberal states, it is also one of 23 in the nation that do not allow ballot initiatives.\nThe Vermont bill would allow those 21 and older to possess up to one ounce of marijuana, two adult plants and four immature plants beginning on July 1. It does not immediately clear the way for retail sales of the drug, leaving that up to a commission created last year to study how to tax and regulate it.\nPassage would put the state directly at odds with the Trump administration. Last week, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions reversed an Obama-era policy easing enforcement of federal laws banning the drug in eight states where it is legal.\n\u201cVermont in particular doesn\u2019t care very much what the attorney general thinks,\u201d said Matt Simon, New England political director for the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project. \u201cWith the way this bill is written, having a few plants, there\u2019s nothing that the feds could do even if they wanted to.\u201d\nLaw enforcement groups in Vermont have criticized the legalization drive, saying the drug poses health risks and that there is no way to quickly test drivers who might be intoxicated by marijuana.\nNeighboring Massachusetts, nearby Maine and six other states have legalized marijuana use as a result of voter initiatives.\nNew Hampshire\u2019s House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a similar bill to legalize recreational marijuana use.
