A container ship is loaded at a terminal in the harbour of Hamburg, Germany September 23, 2012. REUTERS\/Fabian Bimmer\/File Photo \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Commission have for years urged Germany to lift domestic demand and imports in order to reduce global economic imbalances and fuel global growth, including within the euro zone. \nIfo said the German current account surplus -- which measures the flow of goods, services and investments -- was the world\u2019s largest for the second year running in 2017 at $287 billion, followed by Japan with $203 billion. \nU.S. President Donald Trump has criticised Germany for doing too little to reduce its trade surplus with the United States, accusing Germany of \u201cvery bad\u201d trade policies. \nChancellor Angela Merkel has pushed back, pointing to private consumption becoming the main driver of growth. \nMerkel also pointed out that the German surplus is mainly a result of the interplay of supply and demand on global markets and that Berlin has only limited influence on other important factors such as the euro exchange rate and energy prices. \nChina slipped to third place with a surplus of $135 billion, less than half Germany\u2018s. \nThe German current account surplus fell to 7.8 percent of total output in 2017 from 8.3 percent in the previous year. \n\u201cTraded goods are the main reason for the German surplus,\u201d said Ifo economist Christian Grimme. \u201cThe main driver was high demand from the European Union and the United States.\u201d \nIn the first 11 months of last year, Germany\u2019s trade surplus in goods was 249 billion euros (221.00 billion pounds) as exports continued to outstrip imports.

Workers walk through Las Vegas Convention Center lobby as they prepare for the 2018 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Steve Marcus \nCES, the showcase for the latest consumer electronics from televisions to self-driving cars, is known for mostly male attendees and female models known as \u2018booth babes\u2019 showing off the new technology. \nIt has attracted criticism for not making itself more welcoming for women or toning down its sexualised atmosphere even as the issue of harassment and assault has grabbed headlines in the last six months and propelled the #MeToo movement into life. \n\u201cThe fact that this large global gathering of tech leaders is totally ignoring this issue makes them completely tone deaf and irresponsible,\u201d said Liliana Aide Monge, chief executive of California coding school Sabio, who is skipping CES for the second year in a row because of the lack of women and minority speakers. \nThe organizers of CES, which opens its doors to nearly 200,000 attendees in Las Vegas on Tuesday, drew criticism last month from executives at Twitter Inc and other tech companies for a keynote list dominated by white men. CES made a concerted push to diversify its entire speaker lineup, but ultimately failed to find a high-ranking female executive for an individual keynote address. \n\u201cTo keynote at CES, the speaker must head (president\/CEO level) a large entity who has name recognition in the industry,\u201d said Karen Chupka, who oversees the event as senior vice president at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), in a blog post a month ago. \u201cAs upsetting as it is, there is a limited pool when it comes to women in these positions. We feel your pain. It bothers us, too. The tech industry and every industry must do better.\u201d \nOn top of that, CES also will go forward without creating a code of conduct, a mechanism several conferences in technology and other industries have adopted in recent years to set rules for behaviour for attendees, from guidelines on using inclusive language in presentations to requirements that attendees wear name tags at all events, even after hours, to deter misconduct. \n\u201dIt\u2019s sad that CES doesn\u2019t have a code of conduct,\u201d said Y-Vonne Hutchinson, founder of ReadySet, a diversity-focused consulting firm. \u201cThey have a lot of influence. If they\u2019re choosing not to leverage that to promote diversity and inclusion at large, that communicates to the rest of the industry that maybe it isn\u2019t as necessary as we keep saying that it is.\u201d HIGH STAKES \nEvidence of the effect on shows\u2019 safety and tone is mostly anecdotal, but several conferences with these codes, including hacker convention DEF CON, CoreOS Fest and Cloud Foundry Summit, say they have removed attendees after reports of harassment. \nThe stakes are high for the technology industry, rocked in the past year by a sexual harassment scandal at Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and misconduct by some prominent Silicon Valley investors. Technicians set up a display in the lobby of the Las Vegas Convention Center in preparation for the 2018 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Steve Marcus \nThe organizers of CES say they expect attendees to heed their own companies\u2019 standards of business conduct and will kick out anyone who behaves poorly, but will not introduce a set of guidelines. \n\u201dWe don\u2019t necessarily have specific rules because we assume everyone will be held accountable to the standards of being in an office,\u201d said Chupka. \n\u201cUnacceptable\u201d behaviour would be addressed by the executive team and legal counsel as necessary, the CTA said. \u201cWe have the right at any time to revoke a show badge and\/or trespass an individual.\u201d CES notes that it has received no reports of sexual harassment at the event in recent years. \nWomen subjected to uncomfortable situations at or near past CES gatherings told Reuters that they did not report incidents because they were too used to it or did not recognise there was a way to do so. Technicians set up a display in the lobby of the Las Vegas Convention Center in preparation for the 2018 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Steve Marcus \nTo change that thinking, the show is debuting a security app that lets attendees report issues from crimes to broken elevators. While there will be no effort to promote the app specifically as a way to report sexual harassment, attendees may do so, and CES said its lawyers will be ready to act. SLUSH CODE \nThe need for a code of conduct became apparent at Finland\u2019s Slush tech startup event in 2016 when multiple women spoke up about being inappropriately touched and receiving unwanted propositions for sex by male attendees as well as being ignored by investors who were only interested in working with male entrepreneurs. \nThe following year, it doubled security, trained staff on how to handle reports of harassment and instituted a code of conduct, including a requirement to wear name badges at all times as a way to make it easier for attendees to identify a harasser. \nA similar approach has been adopted by some in the U.S. tech industry. Salesforce.com Inc\u2019s Dreamforce event, second only to CES in attendee numbers, added a code of conduct in 2014, while film, tech and music conference South by Southwest added one in 2016. Meanwhile, large conferences run by Oracle Corp and RSA Security have not adopted such a code. \nIt remains to be seen if CES\u2019s lack of a code of conduct will prove costly. \nLas Vegas\u2019 reputation for excess is part of the problem, said Liz Lopez, a tech marketing professional who has attended several industry conferences in the city. \n\u201cPeople are over the edge in their behaviour when they\u2019re in Vegas,\u201d she said.

If you fail to crack the code, you could lose top talent, allow toxic attitudes to fester, or even imperil your entire business. Having a bulletproof way to connect with employees is vital. Here's how top business leaders and members of The Oracles forge world-class connections with their teams. 1. Give employees a voice and a vote \nEmbrace crowdsourcing and social choice. The best knowledge comes from the people on the front lines. We built tools that our people have used to power many decisions for years. There are voting mechanisms within Overstock that make it like a constitutional monarchy\u2014I retain the right to make little adjustments if the crowd wants something that I think is a mistake, but, overwhelmingly, they drive decisions and priorities. \u2014 Patrick Byrne , CEO of Overstock.com and tZERO 2. Hear what your employees are actually saying \nThe most powerful way to build any relationship and make someone feel valued is to listen. Opening your ear to employees to find out what's going right and wrong is smart business. You avoid many plane crashes by regularly asking people, \"How's it going?\", before really listening to their answer. It's always nice to get a compliment, but there's real gold in well-intentioned criticism from a loyal employee. The only way you'll get the gold is by actively listening. \u2014 Barbara Corcoran , founder of The Corcoran Group and Shark on \" Shark Tank \" 3. Empower, ask, and listen \nOur job as leaders is to empower our teams and root for them. My employees unequivocally know that I want to win, but not at their expense. Make it clear to your employees that you want them to be happy and live their dreams. Instill a strong sense of trust and safety. That kind of support builds insane loyalty, while inspiring employees to go all in and deliver. \nAnother hallmark of a good leader is to ask questions. It's the best way to show your team that you recognize they're more than just cogs on a wheel. \"Hey, how are things going?\" \"How's the new baby?\" \"What are you excited about lately?\" \"Any ideas you'd like to discuss?\" And then, for God's sake, listen. \u2014 Gary Vaynerchuk , founder and CEO of VaynerMedia (700+ employees with over $100 million in annual revenue), NYT-bestselling author , and mentor on Planet of the Apps 4. Embrace random connections \nWander around, randomly connect with employees, ask them what they're doing, and how they're doing. Explain what you're doing and what challenges you face. Often, they'll come up with good ideas for how to overcome your obstacles in the process. \u2014 Tim Draper , legendary VC, founder of Draper Associates and DFJ 5. Help every employee reach their goals \nYou need to hold people accountable to their goals. One of the big steps in that process is having someone identify their true motivation, or why . \nCreate an environment that encourages and fosters this type of growth. Schedule team and individual meetings where you create the opportunity for employees to define their why. Encourage them to set ambitious goals at work and in their personal lives. \nFinally, act as a coach and accountability partner as they implement their goals. When you take a genuine interest in your employees and impact their lives beyond the office, you build lasting relationships and a more loyal tribe. \u2014 Tom Ferry , CEO of Tom Ferry International , ranked the #1 Swanepoel Power 200 real estate coach, and NYT-bestselling author of \" Life! By Design \" ; follow Tom on Facebook and Instagram 6. Train them to quit \nNo matter how much you want people to invest in your dream of building an amazing company, most employees have their own dreams and desires. So, we built a program that's designed to help them quit from Day 1. \nWe explain how the company wants to help employees accomplish their dreams, which they list through \"Six Pillars of Happiness\" (Career, Relationship, Time Off, Health, Wealth, Growth). We then teach employees about happiness with workshops to support each \"Pillar.\" \nWe have a performance environment, so the better someone performs, the quicker they reach their dream. By focusing on the goals and desires of our employees and their families, we're always connected and enjoy relationships that last a lifetime. \u2014\u200a Craig Handley , co-founder and CEO of ListenTrust ; read more about Handley: This boss hires and trains his employees to quit 7. Get involved in the day-to-day of your business \nYou can't understand what's happening at each level of the business if you aren't willing to leave the executive floor and dive into the daily dealings of the business. If you make people feel like they're valuable to the company, they will crush it for you. People want to feel needed and acknowledged, especially for a job well done. And if someone is feeling lost or frustrated, it's even more important to hear their point of view. Take care of your people first, and they'll take care of your business. \u2014 Dottie Herman , CEO of Douglas Elliman , a real estate brokerage empire with more than $27 billion in annual sales 8. Make it personal \nOpen your home to employees and be willing to visit a colleague or meet their inner circle. This creates a deeper level of mutual understanding between people who are trying to succeed at work together. It builds trust and opens the door to better understand motives, challenges, and goals, professional and otherwise. It creates opportunities for candor and easy conversation. It gives one another the benefit of the doubt when there's an ability to understand each other's \"bigger picture.\" \u2014 Joe Kakaty , co-founder and president of Poker Central 9. Invest in your most important asset \nWhen your team is happy, energetic, and excited, they're better equipped to deal with paying customers and their positive energy is infectious. \nI create this by investing money, but most importantly, my personal time. I get to know my employees by asking meaningful questions (family, spouse, children), and do my best to remember the answers. \nA true leader is in the trenches with their team, fighting for the same goals together. That's how you build relationships. Keep the best talent by keeping them happy. After all, people are more important than the dollars they generate. \u2014 Mark Bloom , president at NetWorth Realty , ranked by Glassdoor among the \"Best Places to Work\" for two consecutive years 10. Give employees room to try new things and fail \nEncourage your employees to take responsibility and embrace accountability, and you'll build trust and connections like nothing else \u2014 if you deal with their learning curves and failures appropriately. \nOne of my department heads once cost our company $30,000. We arranged a meeting early the next morning. I kicked it off by getting his valued input on upcoming strategic plans. He stopped me a minute into the conversation and said: \"You know I cost the company $30,000. I thought you asked me here to fire me.\" \n\"Fire you?\" I said. \"Why would I "}

Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said on Wednesday he did not know if the central bank would raise interest rates in 2018, but pointed out that its most recent forecasts showed some increases were likely in coming years. Deputy Governor of the Bank of England Ben Broadbent speaks at a Reuters Newsmaker event at Canary Wharf in London, Britain, November 18, 2015.

Smoke rises from a burning cigarette in Bordeaux, France, September 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Regis Duvignau \nTwice, about a year apart, almost 12,000 adolescents were surveyed about their online and social media habits as well as their tobacco use. \nAt the start, most of the teens were online and using social media at least once a day. But 78 percent of them had never used tobacco, and 88 percent had not engaged with online tobacco ads by doing things like signing up for emails, watching videos, sharing links on social media or getting coupons. \nOverall, 6 percent of the participants had used one tobacco product in the year leading up to the first survey and 16 percent had sampled more than one, the study found. \nAmong nonsmokers, the few participants who engaged with tobacco ads at the start of the study were 26 percent more likely to have started smoking and vaping by the end, researchers report in Pediatrics. \nAmong study participants who had already tried tobacco, those who also engaged with online ads were 58 percent more likely to become frequent users of cigarettes and other products by the end of the study and 29 percent less likely to attempt quitting. \n\u201cOne possible influence of engagement with online tobacco marketing is to make teenagers curious about and wanting to try a tobacco product,\u201d said lead study author Samir Soneji, a researcher at Dartmouth College in Lebanon, New Hampshire. \n\u201cCigarette ads are not allowed on television, but there are far fewer restrictions that would prevent tobacco marketers from marketing to children and teenagers online,\u201d Soneji said by email. \u201cUntil those regulations are in place, parents should educate their children about the dangers of tobacco, including e-cigarettes.\u201d \nAdolescents in the study range in age from 12 to 17, and approximately one in three of them lived with a tobacco user. \nThe most common types of engagement were signing up for email alerts about tobacco products, reading articles online or watching videos, the study found. Some teens also used smartphones to scan quick response (QR) codes to enter a tobacco company sweepstakes or visited tobacco websites. \nThe study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how engagement with online tobacco ads might influence smoking or vaping habits, the authors note. \nHowever, the results build on an extensive body of research showing that tobacco ads cause young people to start using tobacco products and become heavier users who are less motivated to quit, said Brian King, deputy director for research translation at the Office on Smoking and Health at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. \n\u201cTobacco products are advertised using themes that can especially resonate with youth, including independence, rebellion, and sex,\u201d King, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cThe bottom line is that tobacco product advertising causes young people to start using tobacco products, irrespective of whether that advertising is made by traditional methods or newer methods such as the Internet.\u201d \nOnline marketing may be harder for parents to police than traditional formats like print or television, said John Pierce, a cancer prevention researcher at the University of California, San Diego, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \n\u201cA major problem is that parents do not know when their child is being targeted by the tobacco industry advertising algorithms,\u201d Pierce said by email. \u201cCertainly we know that if the child clicks on any element of the ad, then that child will be further targeted by the tobacco industry.\u201d \nTo figure out what their kids are finding online, parents should ask them what type of ads are popping up in their social media accounts, Pierce advised. \n\u201cIf they are honest with us, then we can discuss with them what the purpose of the advertising is and what the consequences of clicking on any component of the ad will be,\u201d Pierce said. \nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2E3VHMK Pediatrics, online January 2, 2018."}

The result topped most analysts' predictions, mainly led by worsening drought in the U.S. southern Plains that shriveled available winter wheat grazing pasture. Corn Belt states were the recipients of cattle from areas of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota where insufficient moisture persists. \"These very dry conditions that are developing in wheat pasture country drove change in placements in November. And I suspect we got some of that in December also,\" said Texas A&M University economist David Anderson. Some analysts cited cheaper feed, which lowered input costs for feedlots, as another reason behind last month's placement uptick. And more heifers are entering feedyards, suggesting to analysts that the rate of cattle herd expansion is slowing. On Monday Chicago Mercantile Exchange live cattle futures may open lower following USDA's report, but could quickly rebound spurred by higher-than-expected prices for market-ready, or cash, cattle later on Friday. USDA's report showed December placements at 1.799 million head, up 0.8 percent from 1.785 million a year earlier and exceeded the average forecast of 1.730 million. The government put the feedlot cattle supply as of Jan. 1 at 11.489 million head, up 8.3 percent from 10.605 million a year ago. Analysts, on average, forecast a 7.7 percent rise. USDA said the number of cattle sold to packers, or marketings, were down 1.4 percent in December from a year ago to 1.752 million head. Analysts had projected a 1.2 percent drop from 1.777 million last year. \"The big placement figure tells you that we're going to have big numbers of cattle coming at us for the foreseeable future,\" said U.S. Commodities President Don Roose. He too alluded to the bump in feedlot cattle placements in Corn Belt states where feed is more plentiful. \"You continue to be in a drought in the Southern Plains, that continues to expand, so it no doubt is another factor that you have to throw into the placement discussion,\" said Roose. \n(Reporting by Theopolis Waters in Chicago; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"}

Sign up here .\nWhile MathCapital will operate as a separate entity from MediaMath, startups receiving investment from the fund will also have access to support from the ad tech company, including office space at its headquarters in New York City\u2019s 4 World Trade Center and integration with its technology and clients.\nAd tech companies secured about $3 billion in equity funding in 2017, compared with the industry\u2019s peak of $4.4 billion in 2015, according to data from research firm CBInsights. There was a slight uptick in the number of deals and dollars last year compared with 2016, which CBInsights analyst William Altman says was due in part \u201cto the increased efficacy of artificial intelligence technologies in advertising\u201d and rising investor interest in backing those specialized companies.\nWhile there has been a wave of consolidation in the industry, ad tech investors haven\u2019t all seen the exits they once envisioned. Some deals have been in more distressed situations, like Rocket Fuel\u2019s recent $125.5 million sale to Sizmek , a fraction of its once $2 billion market valuation.\nThe public markets may also be somewhat responsible for investors\u2019 reluctance to pour money into the space. Ad tech stocks fell 4% in 2017, according to investment bank LUMA Partners.\nMr. Zawadzki believes the venture community is under-investing in ad tech and sees data points like these as an opportunity, recalling the often-Quote: d Warren Buffett line, \u201cBe greedy when others are fearful.\u201d\nMr. Zawadzki said there is an \u201cexplosion\u201d of new digital advertising capabilities that still need to be built to help marketers achieve their business goals, from core infrastructure to using artificial intelligence and working on new formats such as virtual reality.\n\u201cThe list of things un-done is longer than the list of things done in terms of finishing this journey,\u201d Mr. Zawadzki said.\nMathCapital formalizes a lot of the work the two ad tech veterans and MediaMath\u2019s corporate development team had been doing in the background for some time.\nMr. Zawadzki has been a prolific ad tech investor for a number of years, having invested in firms including AppNexus, Accordant, Integral Ad Science and Moat. Messrs. Zawadzki and Franchi are both investors in marketing data startup mParticle. Meanwhile, MediaMath had also been involved in incubating some small ad tech startups.\nUndertone, where Mr. Franchi previously worked, sold to publicly traded marketing software company Perion in 2015.\nIn addition to investing in companies itself, MathCapital is also willing to provide expertise to help more generalist venture investors\u2014who can potentially offer more significant capital\u2014navigate the ad tech space, according to Mr. Zawadzki.\nMediaMath\u2019s general counsel, Peter Piazza, and chief investment officer, Dan Bisgeier, are also partners in MathCapital, while executive assistant to the CEO, Larisa Bravette, will be an associate in the firm.\nCorrections & Amplifications\nMediaMath\u2019s headquarters is located at 4 World Trade Center in New York.

The fantasy reboot, which finds Johnson, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart transported into a video game world, has outperformed expectations, picking up a lordly $66.5 million over the holiday weekend. It now has a hefty $185.7 million domestic gross and should continue to draw crowds in 2018. The \u201cJumanji\u201d sequel has also done well internationally, racking up $350 million worldwide, and has provided a much-needed hit for a studio that has struggled to keep pace with the Disney\u2019s and Warner Bros.\u2019s of the world. Sony claims the film has a $90 million budget. Those alleged production costs have raised eyebrows around town as to their veracity given the film\u2019s Hawaii location and starry cast, but regardless of creative accounting and aggressive spinning, the result is impressive. A sequel seems preordained. \n\u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d closed 2017 as the year\u2019s highest-grossing release and the seventh highest-grossing domestic movie of all time with $517.1 million. It will bypass its fellow franchisee \u201cRogue One\u201d at some point on New Year\u2019s Day to take the seventh spot on the stateside charts and has already blown past the $1 billion mark globally. The film carries a $200 million price tag, and has generated controversy for a series of creative decisions by director and writer Rian Johnson that have, depending on your perspective, either infused new energy into decades-old series or deviated dangerously from the Jedi canon. \nIt\u2019s been a dismal year for the domestic box office, which ends 2017 with $11.12 billion in sales, down 2.3% from last year\u2019s $11.38 billion and off slightly from 2015\u2019s $11.14 billion, according to comScore. After a bruising summer, when revenues plummeted more than 6% in the wake of costly flops such as \u201cThe Mummy\u201d and \u201cTransformer: The Last Knight,\u201d the gap did narrow. Fall and winter hits such as \u201cIt,\u201d\u201cThor: Ragnarok,\u201d\u201cCoco,\u201d and \u201cMurder on the Orient Express,\u201d helped make up the difference. The industry was also aided by record ticket prices. Empirically, fewer people made it to the multiplexes. Attendance is expected to hit a 27-year low when official numbers are tallied. \nUniversal\u2019s \u201cPitch Perfect 3\u201d took third place on the stateside charts, grossing $22.7 million for the four-day period and pushing its domestic total to just under $70 million. The a Cappella comedy carries a $45 million production budget and has been billed as the final installment in the franchise.

REUTERS\/Simon Dawson \nHugh Jackman\u2019s musical drama \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d is finishing a close fourth with $20.7 million. The Fox-Chernin Entertainment production chronicles the rise of circus impresario P.T. Barnum. It got a boost from the holidays, and showed the biggest gain in the top 10 movies from the Christmas Eve weekend with an impressive 73% surge. The domestic total should hit $54.3 million through Monday. It\u2019s a pricey movie, though. All that singing and dancing didn\u2019t come cheap and \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d cost $84 million to make. \nFox\u2019s second weekend of \u201cFerdinand\u201d rounded out the top five with $14.6 million, giving the animated comedy $56.8 million domestically. \nNot every film was feeling the holiday spirit. Paramount\u2019s \u201cDownsizing\u201d is a costly bomb. The comedy about a man (Matt Damon) who shrinks to the size of thimble in order to live in a materialistic utopia collapsed at the box office, eking out $6.1 million over the long weekend. Its total stands at $18.5 million -- a paltry result given its $65 million budget. It also prolongs a box office losing streak for Damon. The actor also struck out with \u201cSuburbicon\u201d and \u201cThe Great Wall,\u201d both of which opened during and flopped in 2017. \nWarner Bros. and Alcon\u2019s comedy \u201cFather Figures\u201d was another casualty of the Christmas crunch. The story of two twin brothers (Ed Helms and Owen Wilson) on a quest to find their biological father netted $5.1 million over the four-day weekend. Its total tops out at $14.1 million, making it unlikely that it will recoup its $25 million production budget as well its marketing costs. \nAnd Sony\u2019s \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d struggled to appeal to older audiences. The drama about the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III attracted lots of attention for the filmmakers\u2019 last minute decision to re-cast a key role played by disgraced actor Kevin Spacey. The breakneck reshoots took place in a matter of weeks, with Christopher Plummer assuming the Spacey part as parsimonious billionaire J. Paul Getty, and added $10 million to the film\u2019s $40 million budget. Alas, audiences failed to show up. The movie grossed $7.5 million over the holiday weekend, bringing its domestic total to $14.7 million. \nForeign audiences picked up the slack as domestic attendance sputtered in 2017. The global box office is projected to hit $40 billion for the first time in history, propelled by the return of China. Total ticket sales in the Middle Kingdom grew by 22.3%, ending the year with $8.6 billion in revenues. That, at least, gives a beleaguered movie business some cause for celebration."}

Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline honeymooned, has been severley damaged by the deadly mudslides in Southern California this week.\nOfficials have yet to fully assess the damage at the ranch, which sits on 500 acres in the foothills of the Los Padres National Forest.\nTriggered by heavy rains, the massive mudslides in southern California struck before dawn on Tuesday this week, killing at least 18 people.\nMud and debris cascaded down hillsides that had been stripped of trees and shrubs last month by wildfires, including the Thomas Fire, the largest blaze in the state\u2019s history.\nAfter surviving the fire, the ranch was not so lucky during the mudslides.\n\u201cIt looks like a war zone. It looks like the place just got bombed,\u201d U.S. Congressman Salud Carbajal, a Democrat representing Santa Barbara County, told Reuters while visiting the site on Friday.\nThe resort was not accepting reservations until at least August, according to Cheyanna Rudd, a booking agent for an outside company used by San Ysidro, but Maxine Rutledge, the resort manager, disputed the timeline.\nShe declined to provide further details on when the property would reopen and said owner Ty Warner, the \u201cBeanie Babies\u201d billionaire who bought the place in 2000, did not have an immediate comment.\nThe San Ysidro Ranch, replete with Persian rugs, Italian linen bedding and oak floors, sits in the Montecito foothills.\nFranciscan monks stayed on the property in the late 1700s and it served as a citrus ranch in the 1800s before opening to guests in 1893, according to a history on the ranch\u2019s website.\nThe Academy awarding-winning actor Ronald Colman took over the ranch in the 1930s and it became a haunt of Hollywood stars from Audrey Hepburn to Groucho Marx.\nActors Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier married there and John F. Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline honeymooned there before he became U.S. president.\nResort employees were evacuated ahead of the mudslides and Rutledge said it will be at least one or two weeks until staff can return. The water and mud overflowed a creek behind the resort\u2019s cottages and ravaged a residential area of Montecito on its way to the beach, Santa Barbara County fire spokesman Mike Eliason told Reuters on Friday.\nThe resort had avoided major damage during the Thomas Fire last month as firefighters stopped the fire several hundred yards away, Eliason said, but the ranch has been closed to guests since before Christmas.

Cricket - Ashes test match - Australia v England - SCG, Sydney, Australia, January 8, 2018. Australia's captain Steve Smith holds the Ashes trophy next to team mates after they won the fifth Ashes cricket test match and the series 4-0. REUTERS\/David Gray \nThe series included several singular elements, including a farewell to Perth\u2019s perpetually sunbaked WACA ground and the introduction of day-night cricket under lights at the Adelaide Oval. \nBut for the English contingent among the more than 850,000 fans who streamed through the gates at the five venues, there was a depressingly familiar story arc to the start of the series at least. \nEngland\u2019s preparations had been disrupted by the saga over whether one of their best players, all-rounder Ben Stokes, would be allowed to tour after being filmed fighting outside a nightclub in September. He wasn\u2018t. \nThere were the breathless stories in the Australian media, the most damaging breaking during the opening match of the series about how wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow had greeted Australia\u2019s Cameron Bancroft with a \u2018friendly\u2019 head-butt a month previously. \nEngland were beaten at Brisbane, as most touring teams are, and put up a strong showing without being able to drive home their advantage with the pink ball in Adelaide before meekly relinquishing the urn with an innings defeat in Perth. \nThere, though, the story took something of a diversion - at least from the narrative of the ill-fated 2014-15 tour when the squad simply disintegrated in the face of a humiliating whitewash. \n\u201cThe games may not have not gone well but there has been no infighting within the squad,\u201d said Bairstow, who was on both tours, as the fifth test took a negative turn. \n\u201cThere have been a few things thrown at us while we have been here but there have been no fractures within the group which is a huge positive for us as people and players moving forward.\u201d \n\u201cPOOR\u201d PITCH \nThey were robbed of the chance of a consolation victory in the drawn Boxing Day test in Melbourne at least in part by a dead pitch that was rated \u201cpoor\u201d by the International Cricket Council, and showed considerable fight before another innings loss in Sydney. \nNot giving up, while admirable, is not going to win a test series, however, and England have now gone 10 matches and seven years since winning a test in Australia, and 11 matches since an away win anywhere.The bowling attack for the large part was not good enough to limit the scoring of the Australian batsmen, let alone take 20 wickets a match, and Moeen Ali enjoyed the dismal fate of most visiting frontline spinners in Australia.

REUTERS\/David Gray \nCaptain Joe Root typified the batting of the top order, getting a start in most innings but unable to turn any one of them into a century, and the tail, with the hapless Ali completely out of form, mostly failed to wag. \nDawid Malan was one bright spot with his maiden test century and Alastair Cook hit a magnificent unbeaten 244, albeit at Melbourne after the series had been lost. \nRanged against that was consistent brilliance of Australia skipper Steve Smith, who matched England\u2019s series tally of three centuries on his own - two of them unbeaten and the third a double. \nApparently unmoveable at times, the cricket world\u2019s most famous fidgeter was the inevitable choice as Player of the Series after a Bradmanesque 687 runs at an average of 137.4. Slideshow (6 Images) \nThere were six other centuries from Australians - two apiece from the controversially selected Marsh brothers - which was a reward, Smith said, for their patience. BRAVURA BOWLING \nBatting is, of course, a considerably less pressured occupation when your bowlers are doing their job and Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc all took more than 20 wickets over the series in a bravura display of pace bowling. \nOff spinner Nathan Lyon also managed 21 in a superb series and his nickname of GOAT - Greatest Of All Time - might be starting to lose the original tongue-in-cheek inflection were Shane Warne not still ever-present in the commentary box. \nThat the other initially controversial selection, Tim Paine, was solid as a rock behind the stumps might embolden the selectors to trust their gut instincts for further changes as Australia head on to a series in South Africa. \nSmith is hoping not and thinks the existing team might just be able to take Australia back to the top of the test rankings, and more importantly perform the tricky task of retaining the Ashes on English soil in 2019. \n\u201cThis team has been magnificent in this series, the cricket we\u2019ve played has been great so I think the more we play together the more we are going to get better as a group,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWe have just got to keep getting better and improving as a team.\u201d Editing by Amlan Chakraborty"}

But just as important as breaking bad money habits is forming good ones.\nBelow, CNBC Make It rounds up seven simple money habits you can adopt today that will help make 2018 a more lucrative year.\n1. Automate your finances If your financial plan isn't on auto-pilot, change that immediately, encourages self-made millionaire David Bach. Automating your finances \u2014 sending your money automatically to investment accounts, savings accounts and creditors \u2014 allows you to build wealth effortlessly.\nIt's \"the one step that virtually guarantees that you won't fail financially,\" Bach writes in \" The Automatic Millionaire .\"\n\"You'll never forget a payment again \u2014 and you'll never be tempted to skimp on savings because you won't even see the money going directly from your paycheck to your savings accounts.\"\nshow chapters Here's what you should be doing now to become a millionaire later 9:17 AM ET Fri, 24 Feb 2017 | 01:28 2. Invest your 'spare change' Investing is one of the most effective ways to build wealth , and contrary to popular belief, you don't need a lot of money to get started.\nIn fact, thanks to micro-investing apps such as Acorns , you can start by simply investing your \"spare change.\" The app will round up your purchases to the nearest dollar and automatically put any spare change to work.\nOther apps also aim to make investing simple and accessible, and automated investing services known as robo-advisors can work for you, no matter how much you have in the bank.\nThe key takeaway: Start investing sooner rather than later to take full advantage of compound interest. As Bach explains, \"the miracle of compounding can transform a relatively small but consistent amount of saving into major wealth.\"\n3. Come up with specific money goals \"The number one reason most people don't get what they want is that they don't know what they want,\" self-made millionaire T. Harv Eker writes in his book \" Secrets of the Millionaire Mind .\" \"Rich people are totally clear that they want wealth.\"\nTo reach that level of clarity, he suggests writing down goals for your annual income and net worth. Like all goal-setting, be realistic, but don't be afraid to challenge yourself. After all, the wealthiest people aren't afraid to think big .\nshow chapters How rich people save 12:53 PM ET Tue, 28 March 2017 | 00:50 4. Save, don't spend, unexpected cash Pretend that extra money, such as a bonus , birthday check or any windfall, doesn't exist.\nGet in the habit of putting any surprise cash, even if it's just that $20 bill you found in your coat pocket, to work. Apply it to student loans , credit card debt, your emergency fund or an investment account. It'll add up.\nPlus, establishing this habit early on will help you avoid lifestyle inflation when you get more surprise cash in the form of a raise.\n5. Spend 30 minutes a day reading Rich people tend to read . They continue to teach and invest in themselves long after formal education is over. \"Walk into a wealthy person's home and one of the first things you'll see is an extensive library of books they've used to educate themselves on how to become more successful,\" self-made millionaire Steve Siebold writes in his book \" How Rich People Think .\"\nIf it works for the millionaires and billionaires , it could work for you.\nCheck out CNBC's round up of some of the best personal finance books out there, or consider Bill Gates's favorite books of 2017 .\nshow chapters Money classics, summed up in one sentence 9:26 AM ET Mon, 13 March 2017 | 01:30 6. Set your alarm clock earlier In addition to reading, wealthy people tend to wake up early . Self-made billionaires Richard Branson and Jack Dorsey start their days at 5:00 a.m., and they're far from the only successful people to get up before the sun .\nIn a five-year study of hundreds of self-made millionaires , author Thomas C. Corley found that nearly 50 percent of them woke up at least three hours before their work day actually began.\nWe can't guarantee that joining the early bird club will make you rich, but it can't hurt, and it will almost certainly make you more productive.\n7. Surround yourself with successful, high-earners Who you hang out with matters more than you may think. In fact, your net worth tends to mirror that of your closest friends, Siebold points out.\n\"Successful people generally agree that consciousness is contagious, and that exposure to people who are more successful has the potential to expand your thinking and catapult your income,\" Siebold writes. \"We become like the people we associate with, and that's why winners are attracted to winners.\"\nThis is an update of a previously published article.\nDon't miss: The key takeaway from Bill Gates and Warren Buffett's favorite book can help you succeed in 2018\nVideo by Beatriz Bajuelos Castillo\nshow chapters Build more wealth in 2018 by breaking these bad money habits 9:45 AM ET Fri, 29 Dec 2017 | 01:07"}

(NYSE: BAX), a global medical products company, is committed to advancing surgical innovation and today announced an agreement to acquire two hemostat and sealant products from Mallinckrodt plc: RECOTHROM Thrombin topical (Recombinant), the first and only stand-alone recombinant thrombin, and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant, which is used in vascular reconstruction.\n\u201cUncontrolled intraoperative bleeding can lead to a wide variety of clinical and economic complications for patients and hospitals. As a leading provider of advanced hemostats and sealants, Baxter is focused on continually identifying solutions to help meet surgeons\u2019 varying needs,\u201d said Wil Boren, president of Baxter\u2019s Advanced Surgery business. \u201cWe are excited about the addition of RECOTHROM to help surgeons address less severe intraoperative bleeding and PREVELEAK to complement Baxter\u2019s existing portfolio of sealants for cardiovascular and other surgical specialties.\u201d\nThrombin is a proven blood coagulation agent \u2013 used on its own or in combination with other hemostats \u2013 that has been estimated to be used in more than one million patients per year in the United States to help surgeons address intraoperative bleeding 1 . RECOTHROM is a thrombin-based product indicated as an aid to hemostasis whenever oozing blood and minor bleeding from capillaries and small venules is accessible and control of bleeding by standard surgical techniques is ineffective or impractical in adults and pediatric populations greater than or equal to one month of age. As the only topical hemostat from recombinant DNA origin approved in the United States and Canada, RECOTHROM can be used in pediatric and adult patients with or without antibodies to bovine-derived thrombin.\nThe acquisition also includes PREVELEAK, a surgical sealant designed to seal suture holes formed during surgical repair of the circulatory system and to reinforce sutured connections between blood vessels. PREVELEAK augments Baxter\u2019s portfolio of complementary hemostats, sealants and tissue products used in cardiovascular and other surgeries, offering surgeons additional clinically differentiated products to address patients\u2019 varying needs. PREVELEAK is approved in the United States and European Union.\nSales of the proposed acquired products totaled approximately $56 million in the twelve months preceding September 29, 2017. Upon closing, the deal is expected to be modestly accretive to Baxter\u2019s 2018 adjusted earnings and increasingly accretive thereafter. Under the terms of the agreement, Baxter will acquire RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK for an upfront payment of approximately $153 million and potential contingent payments in the future.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018, subject to the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions.\nAbout Baxter\u2019s Surgery Portfolio\nBaxter is committed to advancing surgical innovation with a variety of products and delivery devices used for hemostasis (addressing bleeding), tissue sealing, and hard tissue regeneration, as well as soft tissue repair and microsurgery. With products available in nearly 60 countries, Baxter is at the forefront of providing surgeons and hospitals with innovative products that improve patient outcomes, are convenient to use and are cost-effective. Baxter\u2019s surgical portfolio includes FLOSEAL Hemostatic Matrix, TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant, COSEAL Surgical Sealant and VASCU-GUARD Patch among others.\nAbout Baxter\nBaxter International Inc. provides a broad portfolio of essential renal and hospital products, including home, acute and in-center dialysis; sterile IV solutions; infusion systems and devices; parenteral nutrition; surgery products and anesthetics; and pharmacy automation, software and services. The company\u2019s global footprint and the critical nature of its products and services play a key role in expanding access to healthcare in emerging and developed countries. Baxter\u2019s employees worldwide are building upon the company\u2019s rich heritage of medical breakthroughs to advance the next generation of healthcare innovations that enable patient care.\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\nRECOTHROM Thrombin topical (Recombinant) Indication\nRECOTHROM Thrombin topical (Recombinant) is a topical thrombin indicated to aid hemostasis whenever oozing blood and minor bleeding from capillaries and small venules is accessible and control of bleeding by standard surgical techniques (such as suture, ligature, or cautery) is ineffective or impractical in adults and pediatric populations greater than or equal to one month of age.\nRECOTHROM may be used in conjunction with an absorbable gelatin sponge, USP.\nIMPORTANT RISK INFORMATION\nContraindications\nDo not inject directly into the circulatory system. Do not use for the treatment of massive or brisk arterial bleeding. Do not administer to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to RECOTHROM or any components of RECOTHROM. Do not use in patients with known hypersensitivity to hamster proteins.\nWarnings and Precautions\nFor topical use only. DO NOT INJECT. RECOTHROM may cause thrombosis if it enters the circulatory system. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur. RECOTHROM is produced in a genetically modified Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line and may contain hamster or snake proteins.\nAdverse Reactions\nThromboembolic adverse reactions were reported in 6% of surgical patients treated with RECOTHROM in all completed clinical trials. Antibody formation to RECOTHROM occurred in <1% of patients. None of the antibodies detected neutralized native human thrombin.\nUse in Specific Populations\nPregnancy Category C. RECOTHROM should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use: Safety and efficacy have not been established in neonates. Geriatric Use: Of 644 patients in clinical studies of RECOTHROM, 36% (n=232\/644) were \u226565 years old and 15% (n=95\/644) were \u226575 years old. No differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\nPlease see additional important risk information and Full Prescribing Information .\nPREVELEAK Surgical Sealant Indications\nPREVELEAK Surgical Sealant is indicated for use in vascular reconstructions to achieve adjunctive hemostasis by mechanically sealing areas of leakage.\nIMPORTANT RISK INFORMATION\nContraindications\nNot for use in patients with known allergies to materials of bovine or shellfish origin.\n\u2022 Not for intravascular use.\n\u2022 Not for cerebrovascular repair or cerebrospinal leak repair.\nWarnings and Precautions\n\u2022 Do not use as a substitute for s"}

{"published":"2018-01-03T13:00:00.000+02:00","title":"This Is Your Guide to Buying Bitcoin","text":"By Kirsten Korosec 6:00 AM EST \nBitcoin mania doesn\u2019t seem to be waning. People are even mortgaging their homes to pour money into the cryptocurrency that started out 2017 being worth $1,000. By Nov. 20 the price of Bitcoin had set a new record, passing the $8,000 mark . On the last day of the year, the value of Bitcoin was $14,129 per coin. \nPerhaps you too want to invest in Bitcoin\u2014but you\u2019re not really sure how. Here\u2019s a guide. \nTo be clear, this is not an endorsement for any cryptocurrency, Bitcoin , Ethereum, Ripple or otherwise. It\u2019s also not a suggestion that you should invest in cryptocurrency at all. Here\u2019s what we do know: The markets for these largely untested, unproven digital assets are like teenagers\u2014young and unpredictable. Just look at the volatile ride Bitcoin was on over the Christmas holiday . \nFirst, some context. (Want to get right to the buying? Scroll down to the section \u201cHow Do I Buy Bitcoins?\u201d) What Is Bitcoin? \nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that can be bought, sold, or traded like a commodity. It can also be used to buy goods\u2014pizza, cars, beer, whatever you\u2019d like. \nBitcoin is different from U.S. dollars because it uses peer-to-peer technology to operate. That means there is no central authority\u2014in this example, the U.S. Treasury\u2014to issue new money or track transactions. Those functions are built into Bitcoin itself\u2014specifically, the so-called blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\u2014which is one reason it\u2019s such an attractive, and controversial, concept. \nWhat is the blockchain , you ask? Think of it like a digital version of a public ledger, in which all transactions are recorded for everyone to see. It serves as the primary mechanism for trust in this financial system. \nThe term \u201ccryptocurrency,\u201d by the way, applies to any digital currency that uses cryptography to make secure transactions between two people instantly anywhere in the world. Created in 2009, Bitcoin is the oldest cryptocurrency. Other cryptocurrencies have since emerged, including Ripple and Ethereum. \nBitcoins, which are also called BTC for short, are the units of currency of the Bitcoin system. How Is Bitcoin Generated? \nBitcoins are created or generated by the network as a reward for the \u201cmining\u201d process, a computational effort in which blockchain\u2014that is, public ledger\u2014transactions are verified. \nThe details of this democratic process are complicated. It involves mathematical problems of varying difficulty, software to solve them, and a schedule that ensures that solutions are discovered on a highly regulated basis. All you need to know is that every time a mathematical solution is found, a new \u201cblock\u201d on the chain is created. Blocks cannot be removed or altered once they\u2019ve been accepted by the network. \nThe Bitcoin system allows six blocks to be mined every hour. Because it gets more difficult over time, the system is expected to generate fewer Bitcoins over time. (It is structured such that, for every four years the network is in operation, half the amount of Bitcoins that were created in the previous four years are generated.) The bitcoin supply is capped at just under 21 million coins. More than 16.7 million coins have been mined as of Dec. 30, 2017. So How Do I Buy Bitcoins? \nYou can buy Bitcoins directly from other people using online marketplaces, no different than any other product or service. Alternately, you can also use a digital currency exchange or broker such as Coinbase , Bitstamp , Kraken , and Gatehub . Coinbase is one of the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges. For a beginner, it\u2019s best and easiest to use one of these exchanges. \nYou\u2019ll also need a \u201cwallet,\u201d a place to store the digital currency. (You\u2019ll need one of these no matter which exchange you might use.) The wallet stores your private key, a secret number\u2014a 256-bit string\u2014that gives you access to your Bitcoins. Your private key also allows you the freedom to move across marketplaces. Just because you purchased Bitcoin on a particular exchange doesn\u2019t mean you have to stick with it; your private key ensures that you can always access your wallet, whichever marketplace you use. \nThere different kinds of wallets, including software and hardware wallets. Software wallets are in essence applications, or apps, that you connect with your traditional bank account. There are several to choose from: Coinbase offers a wallet, which is convenient because it is tied directly to its exchange service. There is also Mycelium , a popular mobile wallet, as well as Electrum . Meanwhile hardware wallets store the user\u2019s private keys on a secure hardware device that looks a lot like a flash memory stick. Hardware wallets are considered by some people to be more secure because they can disconnect from the Internet. (There have been cases of hackers stealing Bitcoin from Internet-connected computers . Worried? Here\u2019s how to avoid bitcoin theft .) \nPicked your wallet and your marketplace of choice? Good. Now that you have all the ingredients ready, here\u2019s how to complete the recipe. \nStep one. Create your wallet. The easiest way to do this is through a third-party like Coinbase , Exodus, MyCelium, or blockchain.info . Go to the site of the wallet provider you\u2019ve chosen and sign up. This step requires name, email address, and password. \nStep Two. If you\u2019ve chosen a software wallet, you will be asked to download the app. Download it through the Apple app store or Google Play, depending on whether you have the iOS or Android operating system. Some wallets are designed for desktops; others are better for mobile devices. \nStep Three. Visit the exchange you\u2019ve picked out. Maybe it\u2019s Coinbase, Poloniex , CEX.io, Kraken, Bitfinex, BitPanda, or BitStamp. Register with the exchange. Again, you\u2019ll need your name, email address, password. Most exchanges require you to connect with your bank account to pay for your Bitcoin purchase. \nSome exchanges like Coinbase offer an app that acts as an exchange and a wallet. Through the app, you can both buy and trade Bitcoins as well as store them. That\u2019s fine, but remember that just because you use the Coinbase exchange doesn\u2019t mean you have to use the Coinbase digital wallet. There are many other digital wallets out there. (And exchanges, for that matter.) \nStep four : Go to the exchange\u2019s \u201cbuy\u201d section. Select the amount of bitcoin you want to buy. Given the recent high price of Bitcoin, you can buy less than one Bitcoin on these exchanges. Bitcoin can be divided up to eight decimal points. This means you can buy 0.5 Bitcoins, 0.02 Bitcoins, or even 0. 1 Bitcoin, if it suits your budget.

The average savings account offers a paltry 0.19 percent annual return, only slightly better than a year ago, according to Deposit Accounts.\nSome experts say that money could grow faster at online banks. Some CDs, or certificates of deposit, are also more generous than others.\n\"If you're not seeking out the best returns on savings accounts and CDs, you're leaving money on the table,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. \"It's the only place in the investment universe where you can get extra returns without extra risks.\"\nThese accounts are protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a government agency that provides deposit insurance, for up to $250,000.\nSavings accounts Online banks, McBride said, are currently in an \"arms race\" to lure people with the best rates.\nAlthough current \"best\" rates of around 1.5 percent still seem low \u2014 one could find savings accounts with a 4 percent annual percentage yield in 2006 \u2014 experts say they make sense in the current environment.\n\"We had record low interest rates for nearly a decade, and inflation is still 1.6 percent,\" McBride said. \"When banks are giving car loans for 3 percent and mortgages for 4 percent, no one is getting 10 percent on savings.\"\nPeople are also less likely to look to the past than they are to compare today's rates against each other, said Patricia Seaman, senior director of marketing and communications at the National Endowment for Financial Education.\n\"People feel good about saving 5 cents a gallon on gas, so they feel better about getting another half a percentage [on their savings],\" she said. \"We may not be talking about very much, but psychologically, that looks amazing.\"\nHere are some of the banks with the best savings yields:\n1) Dollar Savings Direct , a division of Emigrant Bank, claims to have \"America's highest rate.\" Saving accounts come with an annual interest rate of 1.60 percent.\n\"It's a smaller internet bank, but it's still a legitimate, FDIC [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation] insured bank,\" said Ken Tumin, founder of the website DepositAccounts.com.\n2) Marcus by Goldman Sachs offers online savings accounts with an annual interest rate of 1.40 percent. \" Goldman Sachs seems to be a little hungrier for deposits,\" McBride said. First National Bank of Omaha also offers an annual interest rate of 1.40 percent on a savers' online account. Neither requires a minimum deposit.\n3) American Express 's savings accounts accrue at 1.35 percent a year.\n4) Discover online savings accounts come with a 1.30 percent annual interest rate. In this account, $15,000 would produce a return of $194.74 in a year. To compare, that same amount in a Chase savings account would earn just $1.50. Barclays, too, offers an online savings account with an interest rate of 1.30 percent.\n5) Synchrony Bank offers a savings account with a 1.30 percent annual return \u2014 and its accounts come with an optional ATM card, although like with most online savings accounts, there is a limit of six withdrawals or transfers in a month. Although this restriction might feel like a nuisance, it's actually helpful to people, McBride said.\n\"Too easy access can defeat the purpose of saving,\" he said.\nCertificates of deposit For savers who won't need their money for an extended period of time, interest rates on CDs can be worth a look. The average 1-year CD returns 0.28 percent . Rates from online banks, however, are also higher.\nPeople generally can withdraw their CD interest at any time throughout the term. There are penalties for withdrawing the original deposit.\n\"If it helps you to think, 'I can't get that money', it's worth it,\" said Seaman.\nHere are some CDs with the best rates:\n1) Online bank Ally has one-year CDs that range from 1.35 percent to 1.70 percent, depending on how much is deposited. Savers should look for CDs with the lowest penalties, said Allan Roth, founder of Wealth Logic. That way they can gain the benefit of a high interest savings account without the restrictions of a CD. \"If you need the money, you break the CD,\" he said.\n2) Marcus by Goldman Sachs also offers certificates of deposits with higher-than-average returns, although there is a $500 minimum deposit. A one-year CD comes with a 1.65 percent interest rate, and a six-year CD has a 2.55 percent annual rate.\n3) Barclays offers a 1.65 percent return for one-year CDs; five-year CDs will deliver 2.40 percent and there is no minimum opening deposit.\nSavers can also \"ladder\" their CDs, in which a person deposits money into, say, a one-, two- and three-year CD, so that they're not tying up too much of their money at once and can reinvest their savings should rates rise.\nshow chapters Fed raises rates and GDP outlook 3:01 PM ET Wed, 13 Dec 2017 | 04:27 It can be hard for people to spend the time and energy to change their saving ways, Roth said. People need to \"fight that inertia.\"\n\"I know so many people that will complain about a sandwich being $12 when it should be $10,\" he said. \"And yet they lose thousands of dollars each year by having their money in a big-name checking account.\"\nKeep in mind you'll pay ordinary income tax rates on earnings from savings accounts.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nStrong economy could be your ticket to a new job\nIf you're tired of Medicare Advantage, now is the time to ditch\nRetire in paradise: 5 countries where you can live the dream"}

Muslims fret amid drive against illegal immigrants in Assam Krishna N. Das 5 Min Read \nFOFONGA, India (Reuters) - Marzina Bibi, a Muslim woman living in Assam, is petrified she will be declared stateless. \nThe 26-year-old\u2019s name was not on a preliminary list of citizens that was published at midnight on Sunday, although she holds a voter identity card and had voted in state elections in 2016. \n\u201cWhy are they doing this to me?\u201d Bibi asked, sitting beside a bamboo mat she was weaving outside her mud house in Assam\u2019s Fofonga village. \u201cThey think I am a Bangladeshi. I was born here, my parents were born here, I am an Indian.\u201d \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which came to power in Assam in the April, 2016 elections, vowed during the campaign to act against illegal Muslim immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh. But rights activists say the drive is also targeting Muslims who are Indian citizens. \nTwo national spokesmen for the BJP declined to comment. \nA spokesman for the Ministry of Home Affairs in New Delhi did not reply to e-mails and a telephone call seeking comment. \nCitizenship and illegal migration are volatile issues in tea-growing and oil-rich Assam, home to more than 32 million people, about a third of whom are Muslims. Hundreds of people were killed in the 1980s in a violent protest by a native Assamese group against outsiders from the state taking the bulk of jobs and cornering resources, including land. \nFor the latest update of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), all residents of Assam had to produce documents proving that they or their families lived in the country before March 24, 1971, to be recognised as Indian citizens. \nAccording to the preliminary list of the NRC, about 19 million people in Assam have now been verified as Indian citizens. More names will be added, and officials say the final list is likely to be published in July. \nReuters spoke to nearly two dozen Muslims, including Bibi, from paddy-growing villages around Fofonga who said their names were not on the preliminary list. \n\u201cI feel we are targeted because we are Muslims,\u201d said Bibi, who said she has already proved she was Indian - she was jailed for eight months on charges of being an illegal migrant from Bangladesh and was let off only after showing documents attesting to her nationality. \nSurrounded by her neighbours in the village, she showed her voter identity card and the court order for her release from jail.

REUTERS\/Anuwar Hazarika \nThe BJP has said previous governments have included many Bangladeshi immigrants on electoral rolls to buy votes. \nAt the local NRC office in the Muslim-majority area, only around 4,500 people had made it to the preliminary list out of nearly 11,000 who had applied. \nThe government officer in charge of the centre, Gautam Sharmah, said there was no religious bias against Muslims. \n\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. We only look at documents,\u201d Sharmah said at his office, as people trickled in to look for their names on the second day of the list\u2019s publication. \u201cThe time taken in the verification process depends on what kind of documents people submit.\u201d \nReuters saw a tribal Hindu man leaving the NRC office with a smile after being told that the names of all six members of his family were on the list. Soon after, two Muslim women came with their infants, and left disappointed. Slideshow (7 Images) \nHundreds of thousands of people fled to India from Muslim-majority Bangladesh after it declared independence from Pakistan on March 26, 1971, setting off a nine-month civil war. Most of them settled in Assam and the neighbouring state of West Bengal, where there are similar demands to send back illegal Muslim immigrants. \nThe migrants include many Hindus, but the federal BJP government has said they will not be deported. \nHimanta Biswa Sarma, Assam\u2019s finance minister who is also in charge of the citizenship register, told Reuters that all those whose names do not figure in the final NRC list would be segregated. \n\u201cDeportation is an issue handled by the central government,\u201d Sarma said. \n\u201cHindu Bangladeshis who had faced persecution should be given shelter in India and that is the central government\u2019s stand.\u201d \nMuslims leaders have called the NRC a tool to make them stateless, likening themselves to Myanmar\u2019s persecuted Rohingya minority. They have also warned of unrest. \nAssam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal told the Times of India daily that the \u201cpeople who are declared foreigners will be barred from all constitutional rights, including fundamental and electoral. They will have only one right \u2014 human rights as guaranteed by the U.N. that include food, shelter and clothing\u201d. \nIn Fofonga, Bibi said she would challenge the list if it did not include her and her family as citizens. \n\u201cWe are poor people, my husband is a labourer,\u201d she said, going back to weaving her mat. \u201cBut I will go to court if we are left out.\u201d Reporting by Krishna N.

The last time the two Koreas engaged in official talks was in December 2015.\nThe meeting will take place at the border truce village of Panmunjom where officials from both sides are expected to discuss the Winter Olympics, to be held in the South next month, and inter-Korean relations, South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told reporters.\nNorth Korea asked for further negotiations about the meeting to be carried out via documented exchanges, Baik said.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un opened the way for talks with South Korea in a New Year\u2019s Day speech in which he called for reduced tensions and flagged the North\u2019s possible participation in the Winter Olympics.\nBut Kim remained steadfast on the issue of nuclear weapons, saying the North would mass-produce nuclear missiles for operational deployment and warned he would launch a nuclear strike if his country was threatened.\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday called the proposed inter-Korean talks a \u201cgood thing\u201d and he and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in announced that annual large-scale military drills would now take place after the Olympics.\nThe North sees the drills as preparations for invasion and justification for its weapons programs that it conducts in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.\nTrump, who hurled fresh insults at the North Korean leader this week, took credit for any dialogue that takes place.\n\u201cDoes anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn\u2019t firm, strong and willing to commit our total \u2018might\u2019 against the North,\u201d Trump tweeted.\nIn an interview with CNN on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned that while it was Washington\u2019s aim to resolve the North Korean crisis diplomatically, \u201cthose diplomatic efforts are backed by a strong military option if necessary.\u201d\nRibbons bearing messages wishing for unification between the two Koreas hang on a barbed-wire fence near the militarized zone separating the two Koreas, in Paju, South Korea, December 21, 2017.

Drivers are subjected to gut-wrenching G-forces, crashes can be fatal. \nAnd then there is the ongoing debate about cost controls, the direction of future rules, preserving a level playing field and obsessive secrecy -- all endlessly recurring themes in Formula One. TEA-TRAY \nBlackburn said skeleton, where riders hit 130kph on what has glibly been compared to an oversized tea-tray, sits somewhere between Americas Cup yachts and Formula One cars in terms of speed and aerodynamics. \n\u201cApplied engineering is far more interesting than the pure stuff, so when its applied to something that\u2019s fun and exciting it does make it a lot easier to solve problems,\u201d she said. \n\u201cThere is the Americas Cup, sailing, Formula One and the high speed ice sports as well. It\u2019s the same concept. In the skeleton we\u2019re still looking at chassis dynamics, it\u2019s not dissimilar.\u201d Bobsleigh - BMW IBSF Bob & Skeleton World Championships - Women Bobsleigh second heat - Koenigssee, Germany - 17\/2\/17 - Elana Meyers Taylor and Kehri Jones of the U.S. in action.

They\u2019ll be things we\u2019ve worked on but not rolled out until the Games because we don\u2019t want Germany, Canada, America copying something.\u201d PAINFUL PROCESS \nAlthough the sled\u2019s structural innards are seen only by the competing nation and competition inspectors, Blackburn said there were few real secrets from past Games as coaches and athletes moved around. \nMost of the loopholes have also been closed and Blackburn, an advocate for change, said it remained \u201can incredibly painful process\u201d to bring the rules into a more modern era and encourage innovation. \nA skeleton sled has a carbon fibre pan on the outside but the chassis is made from steel, a material that is both heavy and expensive as well as distinctly low-tech compared to other options. \n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of different materials now that could be used that are much easier and cheaper to manufacture,\u201d said Blackburn. \n\u201dWith the onset of 3D printing, if somebody wanted to get something custom made they could probably do that now but not with steel. \n\u201cThe fact that we still limit things to steel makes it quite a lot trickier for small nations now to get things made, especially to the precision that skeleton sleds require given the speeds and the temperatures they are going through.\u201d Editing by Peter Rutherford"}

He Has A Football and a Biscuit US President Donald Trump points as he boards Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base on Oct. 7, 2017 in Maryland. Brendan Smialowski\u2014AFP\/Getty Images By Kirsten Korosec 3:23 PM EST \nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s tweet Tuesday night that bragged about the size and capabilities of his nuclear button\u2014it\u2019s bigger and more powerful than North Korea\u2019s\u2014included one error. The president doesn\u2019t have a physical button that he can use to deploy nuclear bombs in seconds. \nSo those worried can strike images of a big red button sitting within reach of the president from their minds. \nTrump\u2019s tweet came in response to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s New Year\u2019s address, in which he repeated threats against the U.S. During the speech, Kim claimed he has a nuclear button on his office desk. North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the \u201cNuclear Button is on his desk at all times.\u201d Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! \n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2018 \nTrump doesn\u2019t have a nuclear button. He has a nuclear football, a black book, and a biscuit. And the process is far more complex than a simple push of a button, or command. \nHere\u2019s how launching a nuclear strike in the U.S. works: A military officer (a position that is top secret and on a rotation) carries a nuclear \u201cfootball,\u201d which is really a briefcase, everywhere the president goes. This briefcase is essentially a roving command center or mobile hub and is used by the president to authorize a nuclear strike when away from the White House Situation Room. It also goes by other names, including the atomic football. Inside the football is a book with prepared war plans and procedures as well as lists of classified site locations, options for retaliation, and targets such as military and other strategic locations. If the president wanted to order a strike, he would approach the military aide, open the briefcase, and review the plans. A command signal would be sent to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. For the strike to be processed by the military, however, he would need to use his \u201cbiscuit,\u201d a plastic card that contains a code unique to him. The president keeps the biscuit on him at all times. The president would communicate the code to military officials at the Pentagon and National Strategic Command. Even then, the process is not complete. The nuclear protocol in the U.S. contains a \u201ctwo-man\u201d rule at nuclear launch facilities. The order by the president must be verified by the Secretary of Defense. This is just a verification that the order came from the president; the Secretary of Defense cannot veto the order. \nFor an even deeper dive, check this piece in Fortune by Admiral James \u201cSandy\u201d Winnefeld , the ninth vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when he retired from the U.S. military in 2015. \nTo be clear, Kim doesn\u2019t have a button that can launch a nuclear weapon in seconds either, according to officials cited by the New York Times . \nHis tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles have involved liquid-fuel weapons that take hours, sometimes days, to prepare for a launching, reported the NYT .

They also face a stiff challenge on Feb. 17 from an unknown collection of Russians, who will play under the Olympic flag. \nThe IOC has banned Russia from formal participation for doping violations, but Russian athletes deemed to be drug-free can compete independently. \n\u201cAny time you play a Russian team you expect high skill and expect to see extremely talented players,\u201d Granato said. \n\u201cHow they put it together and what they do in the next few weeks, we\u2019ll have to keep an eye on, but we\u2019re not going to do anything different as we get ready for the Olympics.\u201d Editing by Greg Stutchbury"}

He previously was CEO at St. John Knits International Inc, where he oversaw a turnaround of the luxury apparel retailer. \nNeiman Marcus had been hunting for a CEO for some time, but several top executives at other companies spurned its approaches, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing sources. \nGlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders said van Raemdonck\u2019s experience at St. John Knits could make Neiman Marcus more attractive to younger shoppers. \n\u201cHe could be the breath of fresh air that Neiman Marcus needs,\u201d Saunders said. \n\u201cThat said, the biggest challenge is managing Neiman\u2019s debt load, which is a millstone around the neck of the company,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are no easy solutions to this, and it is unlikely van Raemdonck has any tricks up his sleeve to remedy the problem.\u201d \nThe company is struggling with a nearly $5 billion debt load, due mainly to its 2013 leveraged buyout by Ares and Canadian public pension fund CPPIB from other private equity firms. \nLike other retail chains, Neiman Marcus has also suffered as customers move away from brick-and-mortar stores in favor of online shopping. \nSame-store sales rose for the first time in two years in its latest quarter, when it benefited from Katz\u2019s efforts to invest heavily in its online business. \nKatz, 60, will be eligible to receive nearly $2.5 million as a lump sum following her retirement as CEO and another $1 million before March 14, 2019, Neiman Marcus said in a regulatory filing. \nVan Raemdonck\u2019s annual base salary will not be less than $1 million, the company said. \nReporting by Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru and Richa Naidu in Chicago; Editing by Martina D'Couto and Lisa Von Ahn\n "}

Sure enough, bitcoin rallied to a high near $19,800 in December, with its performance widely outpacing stocks. \nSince that high, however, the cryptocurrency has fallen 25 percent, trailing stocks, gold and oil, which are up a respective 3 percent, 5 percent and 10 percent during that period. \nDespite the drop, Lee is still pounding the table on the cryptocurrency. \n\"Even on a risk-adjusted basis, I think bitcoin is going to easily outperform the S&P,\" Lee said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Futures Now.\" \"On a long-term basis, [the easiest way to look at bitcoin is] as a replacement or a store of value,\" he said. \"So as millennials discover and generate income, they're going to use it as a replacement for gold.\" \nInvestors have quipped that the bitcoin boom could be taking market share from gold. Over the last year as bitcoin surged about 1,535 percent, gold has been tethered around the $1,300 level. \n\"If [bitcoin] gets 5 percent of the gold market, that's roughly $50,000,\" he added. That's a more than 200 percent move from where bitcoin is currently trading. \nOn a near-term basis, Lee expects bitcoin to reclaim its December high. \"We think that by mid-2018, we're going to be part of the way there, and that's why we get [bitcoin to $20,000],\" he said. \"If [bitcoin] can actually rise close to [that $20,000 level] in the first half of this year, I think in the second half of 2018, we'll see a move bigger than that,\" Lee said. \"So I think bitcoin is still something you should own [all year].\" \nDespite its underperformance in the past month, bitcoin is still up 15 percent in the first few days of 2018."}

Is there a magic number?\nNo, \"there's not a one-size-fits-all answer,\" Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, tells CNBC Make It . \"It depends on what you're using credit for and if you're disciplined about paying the balance in full every month.\"\nHow many cards you can reasonably keep track of without accruing debt?

She said she was returning to her former post in the TV newsroom in London where she expected to be paid equally to men in equal jobs.\n\u201cI am not asking for more money. I believe I am very well paid already -- especially as someone working for a publicly funded organisation. I simply want the BBC to abide by the law and value men and women equally,\u201d she wrote on her website.\nGracie said she was paid 135,000 pounds ($182,800) a year as China editor. According to last July\u2019s disclosures, North America Editor Jon Sopel earned between 200,000 and 250,000 pounds a year, while Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen was in the 150,000 to 200,000 bracket.\nEurope editor Katya Adler, the BBC\u2019s only other female editor in foreign news, did not feature in the disclosures, meaning her pay was less than 150,000 pounds.\nGracie said managers had offered to increase her pay to 180,000 pounds, but that was no solution. She rejected the rise and insisted that all four of the BBC\u2019s international editors should receive equal pay.\n\u201cI was not interested in more money. I was interested in equality,\u201d she said during an interview on BBC radio.\nBritain enacted legislation outlawing sex discrimination in the 1970s and this was followed by an equality act in 2010, but women still earn less than men across much of the economy.\n\u201cENOUGH IS ENOUGH\u201d\nThe BBC defended itself by saying its gender pay gap was below the national average and less bad than at many other organisations, adding that it was committed to wiping it out by 2020. It also said an independent audit of rank and file staff had found \u201cno systemic discrimination against women\u201d at the BBC.\nSeveral high-profile women seized on the Gracie story to say the problem was much bigger than the BBC and affected the whole of society.\n\u201cTip of the iceberg in @BBC & most other orgs (organisations). Equality Act 2010 means no hiding place for shameful discrimination against women. Ending it long overdue,\u201d wrote prominent lawmaker Harriet Harman of the opposition Labour Party, a long-time advocate of women\u2019s equality, on Twitter.\nAs in many other countries, pay inequality based on gender has been a persistent problem in Britain, which by some measures has performed worse than comparable European countries in recent years. Britain was ranked 15th in the World Economic Forum\u2019s global gender gap index 2017, below France and Germany.\nBut Gracie said her complaint was not about the gender pay gap the BBC admits to, which stems from men earning more on average because they do more of the best paid jobs. \u201cIt is men earning more in the same jobs or jobs of equal value. It is pay discrimination and it is illegal,\u201d she said.\nGracie accused the BBC of adopting a botched \u201cdivide and rule\u201d response to the legitimate anger of female staff, offering pay rises to some women while locking down others in a protracted complaints process. In her own case, the process had been \u201cdismayingly incompetent and undermining\u201d, she said.\n\u201cEnough is enough. The rise of China is one of the biggest stories of our time and one of the hardest to tell,\u201d she wrote, citing Chinese state censorship, surveillance, police harassment and official intimidation.\n\u201cI cannot do it justice while battling my bosses and a byzantine complaints process.\u201d\n($1 = 0.7384 pounds)\nAdditional reporting by Michael Martina in Beijing; editing by David Stamp\n "}

The first trading week of 2018 looks set to be the best for Euro zone stocks since May, as shares shrug off a stronger single currency.\n\u201cThere is little impediment for continued gains whilst economic conditions that we\u2019ve seen over the last few months continue, and there\u2019s every reason to expect that to continue to be the case,\u201d Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said.\nEmerging market stocks have had their best start to the year since 2006 and added to those gains on Friday.\nThe U.S. dollar failed to draw much strength from better-than-expected private payrolls data on Thursday and manufacturing numbers earlier this week, leaving the greenback around a four-month low against the euro.\nEuro zone prices grew by 1.4 percent in December on a year earlier, a slower rate than in the previous month. That provides support for the European Central Bank\u2019s decision to keep policy easy despite growing pressure from richer euro zone countries.\nStill, with two U.S. interest rate hikes already baked into market expectations, traders believe there is more upside room for the euro as the ECB may move to rein in its monetary largesse faster than the market anticipates.\nU.S. PAYROLLS DUE Investors will also be looking closely at the monthly employment report in the U.S., along with average hourly earnings data, due at 1330 GMT.\nThe data could give some clues to the likely path for when central banks will tighten.\n\u201cCurrency markets broadly know what the Fed is going to do this year but the ECB monetary policy may be the surprise package of 2018,\u201d said Richard Falkenhall, senior FX strategist at SEB in Stockholm.\nThe dollar has weakened as U.S. long-term bond yields have remained low, despite the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates three times last year.\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood just above 2.46 percent, below its seven-month peak of 2.504 percent touched on Dec. 21.\nThose levels are little different from about a year ago, even with market expectations for another three hikes in 2018.\nExpectations that inflation will remain low as wage growth has been slower than before the 2007-2008 financial crisis has capped U.S. long-term bond yields.\nElsewhere, oil prices slipped from highs last seen in 2015 after soaring U.S. production undermined a 10-percent rally driven by tightening supplies and political tensions in Iran - from lows hit in December.\nGold prices dipped from the previous session\u2019s 3-1\/2 month high but remained on track for their fourth straight weekly gain.\nSigns of investor appetite for risk more broadly were evident in Greece, where 10-year borrowing costs hit their lowest in 12 years on Friday.\nThe country, once on the verge of defaulting on its debts, has benefited from expectations of a clean exit from its bailout this year and a revival in the economy.\n\u201cGreece\u2019s fundamentals have been on the mend and investors have been looking at the yield pick-up they get from investing in that debt,\u201d said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk.\n\u201cAlso, a rising tide lifts all boats - with the euro zone economy doing so well, it\u2019s a very \u2018risk on\u2019 environment and that is benefiting Greece.\u201d\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets open a news window on Reuters Eikon by pressing F9 and type in \u2018Live Markets\u2019 in the search bar.\nAdditional reporting by Saikat Chatterjee, Kit Rees and Abhinav Ramnarayan; Reporting by Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n "}

Failure to comply with GPDR is likely to result in penalties totaling either 4 percent of global turnover or 20 million euros ($23.5 million) \u2014 whichever value is greater.\nThe 'pivotal' question: Can global growth continue in 2018? \"We think yes,\" UBS analysts said in a research note.\nResearchers at Switzerland's biggest bank said financial conditions in the U.S. and Europe were \"easy\" and most of the adjustments for the global economy were now behind us, \"leaving the playing field more level and free for growth to catch up.\"\nUBS economists forecast global growth to reach 3.8 percent in 2018 \u2014 the same level as in 2017 \u2014 with all major economies set to participate.\n\"Despite the length of the recovery, there is room for global growth to expand amid very few signs of excess in the real economy,\" the banks analysts' said.\nElsewhere, PwC projected global economic growth to peak at 3.7 percent next year. The accountancy and professional services firm said a stronger-than-anticipated cyclical recovery in the euro zone and robust growth in the U.S. should be supportive.\nTrump vs. Macron The next calendar year should also see two competing political ideologies come to the fore, according to The Economist's Daniel Franklin.\n\"While President Donald Trump focuses on his inward-looking ' America First ' agenda, France's President Emmanuel Macron promises a new kind of pro-globalization social contract, one that boosts competition and entrepreneurship while protecting workers who lose out,\" he said.\nTrump has been accused of prioritizing national sovereignty over international alliances during his first 12 months in the Oval Office. However, the former New York businessman has insisted he wants to create good, well-paying jobs and his administration's plan includes an \"America First\" trade policy alongside corporate tax cuts and an ambitious bid to invest in infrastructure.\nNonetheless, Trump's \"closed world views\" are in direct contrast to Macron's, Franklin said.\nThe two leaders' opposing ideologies have been evident on the international stage before too. Shortly after Trump vowed to withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, France's Macron announced an initiative titled \" Make Our Planet Great Again \" \u2014 an apparent rebuke to Trump's campaign pledge to \"Make America Great Again.\"\nPhilippe Wojazer | AFP | Getty Images French President Emmanuel Macron holds a sign with the slogan 'Make our planet great again' as he attends the 'Tech for Planet' event at the 'Station F' start-up campus ahead of the One Planet Summit in Paris on December 11, 2017. Meantime, Macron wants to make France's labor market more flexible in order to improve the country's economy. He has championed the need for France to become more competitive and made labor reform one of his showpiece policies on the campaign trail. However, the issue has always sparked problems with trade unions.\nOver the coming months, Franklin predicted Macron would emerge as the modern-day equivalent of former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt \u2014 the American premier most associated with the \"Progressive Era\"."}

Privately owned Lactalis, one of the world\u2019s biggest dairies, exports its baby food products to 83 countries across Europe, Africa and Asia.\nThe recall involves up to 12 million tins of baby milk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to evaluate the number of items that need to be returned because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s been consumed already,\u201d he said.\nFriday\u2019s recall was the third in a month and Lactalis has come under fire for its botched response. Besnier also told the French weekly that the company had acted as quickly and efficiently as possible and denied slowing the process to curb losses.\nBesnier has also been criticised for failing to speak out publicly during the salmonella scare.\nWhile his family are France\u2019s 11th wealthiest, according to a 2017 ranking by Challenges magazine, the dairy tycoon has long shunned the public limelight and schmoozing with politicians.\nHis workers nickname him the \u201cinvisible man.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re a discreet business.

U.S. crude CLc1 rose 34 cents to $61.97, after earlier hitting $62.21, its highest since May 2015. \nFreezing weather in the United States has spurred short-term demand, especially for heating oil. Heating oil futures were down 0.8 percent to $2.0712 a gallon; the contract hit highs not seen since February 2014 earlier in the week. \nU.S. crude stocks USOILC=ECI fell by 7.4 million barrels in the last week of 2017, exceeding expectations, as refiners boosted activity to their highest rate since 2005, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. \nFILE PHOTO: A pumpjack brings oil to the surface in the Monterey Shale, California, April 29, 2013.

U.S. crude stocks have dropped by more than 78 million barrels since the middle of 2017 to 424.5 million, the lowest since September 2015. \nAnti-government protests since last week in Iran, OPEC\u2019s third-largest producer, have added a geopolitical risk premium to oil prices, though the country\u2019s production and exports have not been affected, sources said. \nApart from a spike in May 2015, oil is trading at its highest since December 2014 - the month after a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to stop cutting output to support prices. \nAnalysts at JBC Energy said the price reaction to the Iranian unrest was overdone, while Swiss bank Julius Baer said prices projected \u201can overly rosy picture\u201d that left the market at risk of profit-taking. \nOPEC, supported by Russia and other non-members, began to reduce output a year ago to remove a glut built up in the previous two years. Compliance has been high, aided by involuntary declines in Venezuela, where the economy is collapsing, plus unrest in Nigeria and Libya. \nProducers have decided to extend the supply pact until the end of 2018. \nOPEC\u2019s cuts are helping reduce global inventories, even as production continues to rise in the United States, where OPEC efforts are spurring more output from shale.

Jana seeks new money, allies with impact hedge fund","text":"January 12, 2018 \/ 8:53 PM \/ Updated 30 minutes ago Fields of Gold? Jana seeks new money, allies with impact hedge fund Svea Herbst-Bayliss , Ross Kerber 7 Min Read \nBOSTON (Reuters) - Wall Street investor Barry Rosenstein\u2019s new impact investing fund aimed at serving environmental and social causes could, if he plays his cards right, enhance his traditional business of pushing companies to boost earnings. \nThe founder of JANA Partners has tapped British musician and activist Sting to sit on the new fund\u2019s advisory board and burnish his credentials with green and socially conscious investors he hopes will pledge at least $1 billion. \nThat amount is a fraction of the billions that have been pulled from Jana since 2015. Its assets have shrunk by more than half to $5 billion since then, as hedge fund investors fled to cheaper, passive products. Still, it gives him an important foothold in the growing arena of \u201cresponsible investing\u201d. \nIndustry watchers said Rosenstein could forge more alliances with institutional investors that could carry over to Jana\u2019s main business: pushing companies to make financial changes that often include recapitalizing or restructuring the business. \n\u201cThere is a longer game here than just this one fund,\u201d said a hedge fund industry advisor who is not permitted to speak publicly about individual hedge fund firms. \u201cThe new fund will create a bridge with other institutional investors which Jana may need in its future activism.\u201d \nPeople familiar with the fundraising say commitments have already been made and interest is high. The fund will not be a typical hedge fund product, people familiar with the matter say, noting the fees are expected to be lower. \nJana made its first foray into socially minded investments this month, pressuring Apple to give parents more control over the setup options of their children\u2019s iPhones. The fund partnered with CalSTRS, the largest U.S. public sector teachers\u2019 pension fund and one that is increasingly emphasizing social responsibility in its bets. \nCalstrs does not invest with Jana but with $222 billion in assets under management, more than half of it in stocks, it could be a powerful ally in future activist fights. Apple reacted quickly, promising new parental controls, and the hedge fund industry is chalking this up as a victory for Jana. \nCalstrs spokeswoman Michelle Mussuto declined to comment on its work with Jana. \nRosenstein cut his activist teeth during the 1980s heyday for corporate raiders, a background that has made traditional environmental, social and governance (ESG) activists doubt the sincerity of his pivot to socially conscious investing. \nLast year, John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods, called Jana \u201cgreedy bastards\u201d as the hedge fund pushed for a sale of the grocery chain. \nCharles Penner, a partner at Jana, defended the new direction. \n\u201cIt is not inconsistent with what we have done historically, it is just different,\u201d he said. \nThe Jana Impact Capital Fund is set to launch later this year. Joining Sting as an advisor is Patricia Daly, a nun who battled Exxon Mobil Corp over environmental disclosures. Sustainability expert Robert Eccles, who has taught at Harvard Business School, will also be on board. None of the three were available to comment. WALL STREET CHOPS \nUntil recently, activism in the responsible investing space was largely the preserve of religious funds and public pension leaders with a genteel approach to boardroom battles and the patience to wait years for progress. \nBut now more major investors, including sovereign wealth funds and pensions, are pushing companies on issues like climate change, income and gender equality. By bringing some hard-charging Wall Street chops into this arena, Jana could stand out and, if successful, curry favor with such investors. \nIn its 17-year history, Jana has waged roughly 75 activist campaigns at companies ranging from Walgreens Boots Alliance to Tiffany & Co., delivering an annualized average return of 11 percent in its flagship fund. \nIts JSI fund, which concentrates purely on activist situations, has returned an annualized 18 percent since its 2010 launch after gaining 22 percent in 2017, matching the S&P 500\u2019s 22 percent gain. \nThe flagship Jana Partners fund, meanwhile, gained 5.6 percent last year, underperforming the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index. \nAt a time when flows to hedge funds have been thin, the socially responsible space is appealing. Net deposits into socially responsible mutual funds were $4.7 billion in 2017, a 22 percent jump from the year before and a large leap from 2013, when investors directed just $1 billion into the category. \nOne reason is returns. A Vanguard fund based on the popular FTSE4Good US Select Index of ESG stocks for instance beat the S&P 500 in three of the last five years, including in 2017, according to Morningstar. \nHedge funds are still smarting from $70 billion in redemptions in 2016, Hedge Fund Research data show. The sector, including activist funds, did see an uptick of investor inflows in 2017, with $2.9 billion added in the first three quarters. \n\u201cA BIT OF A STRETCH\u201d \nJana\u2019s past record of shareholder activism means it is carrying some baggage as its climbs onto the responsible investing bandwagon, some people say. Some investors think the firm has a way to go to prove its commitment to social and environmental concerns. \nThe new fund is \u201ca bit of stretch, no question\u201d said Seamus Finn, chairman of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, whose members include religious groups, foundations and other organizations. \nSome of Finn\u2019s members have described Jana as disinterested at best in their efforts to get companies to heed environmental or social concerns. \nJana\u2019s Penner said the firm would not have been able to take up such causes in the past because it was not part of its investment profile. \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a mandate to do that,\u201d he said. \nBoston Common Asset Management, which has a long-running partnership with energy producer Apache Corp aimed at improving sustainability and protecting the rights of indigenous peoples, said it did not hear from Jana when it took a stake in Apache in 2014. [ reut.rs\/2AKl8AH ] \nBut Geeta Aiyer, Boston Common\u2019s president, is willing to give Jana the benefit of the doubt. \n\u201cIf they move from the business of shortening already-short time horizons to taking a longer-term view, it could put to bed this whole debate about whether being a responsible investor is somehow bad for returns,\u201d Aiyer said.

Spot gold was down 0.3 percent at $1,308.82 an ounce at 0712 GMT. U.S. gold futures dropped 0.6 percent to $1,310 an ounce. Spot gold marked its highest since Sept. 15 at $1,321.33 on Wednesday, but then dropped as the dollar recovered from over 3-month lows. It fell further after minutes from the Federal Reserve's December policy bolstered expectations for more U.S. interest rate hikes. Gold, which had rallied $85 from nearly 5-month lows hit in mid-December, posted its first day of losses in nearly three weeks on Wednesday. \"People are looking to lock in some gains after a pretty strong rally over the past weeks,\" said ANZ analyst Daniel Hynes. \"Geopolitical issues have certainly been a huge power point of the gold's rally into the year-end ... It is going to be a U.S. dollar type story going forward with markets taking a neutral view.\" The dollar was firm on Thursday in the wake of upbeat U.S. data . U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, boosted by a surge in new orders growth, in a further sign of strong economic momentum at the end of 2017. Minutes from the Fed's Dec. 12-13 meeting were seen as more hawkish than anticipated, indicating the central bank is still poised to raise interest rates several times this year. The minutes suggested that the central bank would continue to pursue a gradual approach in raising rates but could pick up the pace if inflation accelerates. Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates as they increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced. \"We still feel that gold has come a long way and may correct a little further from here,\" MKS PAMP trader Alex Thorndike said. \"That being said we view a pullback towards $1,290-$1,295 as a decent buying opportunity.\" Spot silver fell 0.6 percent to $17 an ounce, after hitting a six-week high on Wednesday at $17.24. Spot platinum was down over 1 percent at $943 an ounce. Spot palladium rose 0.4 percent to $1,086.95. It touched an all-time high on Tuesday at $1,096.50.

Charles Harder, a lawyer for the president, told Reuters that he would take \u201clegal action\u201d to block the book\u2019s release. He sent cease-and-desist letters to Bannon, Wolff and publisher Henry Holt & Co.\nAlan Dershowitz, an emeritus law professor at Harvard Law School, said a libel lawsuit by Trump would be a \u201cterrible mistake\u201d and \u201ca nonstarter\u201d that \u201cno reasonable lawyer would recommend.\u201d\nDershowitz, who has often publicly defended the legality of the president\u2019s actions over the past year, said it is very difficult for public figures to prevail in libel suits. Trump would need to show Wolff and publisher Holt knew statements by Bannon and others were false or they acted with reckless disregard for whether or not they were true.\nIn the book, Bannon was Quote: d describing as \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic\u201d a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting Donald Trump Jr. and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner held with a group of Russians who had promised damaging information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\nBannon has not responded to requests for comment.\nTrump Jr. and Kushner have not commented on the Quote: s.\nElsewhere in the book, Wolff in his own voice describes Trump as \u201cno more than semi-literate\u201d in terms of his reading habits and being known among his social circle for having a \u201cwide-ranging ignorance.\u201d\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders described the book as \u201csome trash\u201d filled with \u201cmistake after mistake.\u201d\nThe publisher defended the book.\n\u201cWe see \u2018Fire and Fury\u2019 as an extraordinary contribution to our national discourse, and are proceeding with the publication of the book,\u201d Holt said in a statement.\nHolt on Thursday moved up the book\u2019s release to Jan. 5 from the original publication date of Jan. 9.\nOPINIONS PROTECTED Some lawyers said Bannon, Wolff and the publisher could all argue that many of the comments in the book were opinions, which are protected by the First Amendment and cannot be the basis of a libel action. Andrew Wright, a former associate counsel in the Obama White House and professor at Savannah Law School, said that would include Bannon\u2019s \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic\u201d Quote: s.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Bannon would have a hard time establishing that he meant it as an opinion that it was disloyal and improper rather than as a statement of law,\u201d said Wright.\nIn one letter to Bannon and another to both Wolff and Steve Rubin, President & Publisher, Henry Holt and Company, Harder also said Bannon violated non-disclosure and non-disparagement provisions of his employment agreement with the Trump 2016 election campaign by speaking with Wolff. He said Wolff and Holt could face claims of interfering with or inducing breach of that contract.\nBut legal experts said the employment agreement would not have applied to Bannon after he joined the White House staff. Because of transparency and free speech concerns, the government has far less power to limit non-classified speech by employees than private companies, said Bradley Moss, a Washington lawyer specializing in national security law.\nApart from facing long odds, a Trump libel lawsuit would also force the president to participate in an intrusive disclosure process.\nDershowitz said that defense lawyers would be able to subject Trump to \u201cbroad and far-ranging\u201d depositions about \u201calmost anything\u201d and compel him to answer.\nMoss said defense lawyers would also be entitled to interview White House officials and collect potentially damaging documents from them. \u201cIt would be one more distraction, one more thing people in the administration need to hire lawyers for.\u201d\nTrump has a history of threatening lawsuits in his real estate business career and during his election campaign, though he has not always followed through. In the campaign, he threatened to sue the New York Times over its reporting that he made unwanted advances on two women.\nThen-Republican candidate Trump was accused by 13 women who publicly said that in the past he had physically touched them inappropriately in some way. He said he would sue all of the women, calling them liars, but those lawsuits have not been filed.\nReporting by Jan Wolfe; Editing by Anthony Lin and Grant McCool\n "}

The common thread?\n\"Tax reform. That's right, the very event that was supposedly baked into the [market], that all the graybeards ... said was being overblown, is proving to be the main reason for most of these positive analyst reports and upgrades,\" Cramer said.\nThe sudden change of heart made Cramer wonder why so many commentators told investors to stay out of the market because of the tax plan's effect on stocks.\n\"Frankly, I am outraged about this,\" he said. \"I've been adamant that the surprise of tax reform \u2014 and come on, hardly anyone thought this bill could even pass as late as November \u2014 occurred so quickly that the analysts didn't even have a chance to revise their estimates.\"\nNow, analysts are anointing a host of U.S.-based, high-taxpaying companies including Ulta Beauty , Dave & Buster's , Dick's Sporting Goods , General Mills and Waste Management all because of the tax plan's passage.\n\"You know what? I think these are all buys, every one of them,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\nHere's how Cramer sees it: Ulta's spent enough time in the doghouse to start making a comeback; Dave & Buster's \"experiential\" positioning gives it plenty of room to expand; Dick's Sporting Goods can stand to rise with Nike and Under Armour falling back into favor; and General Mills deserved an upgrade after a better-than-expected quarter .\nAs for Waste Management, which caught a price target raise from Macquarie's research arm on Wednesday, Cramer said the company was poised for success as it tackled the post-hurricane cleanup in Texas and Florida.\n\"Can the stock actually hit $114?\" Cramer wondered, referencing Macquarie's target price. \"Hey, it's only at $87, but at this pace, other analysts will have to raise their price targets and the whole process will start all over again.\"\nAnd as heated as the \"Mad Money\" host was about the recommendations, he couldn't deny that they were boosting the corresponding stocks.\nCramer recalled his time working at a major research firm, when research directors demanded for analysts to come up with buys for the following day.\n\"It's been 16 years since I've seen so many recommendations that actually move stocks, move 'em big.

The Company and Innovate have amended the merger agreement to provide the outside termination date for the Merger will be January 26, 2018.\nAs previously disclosed, following the Closing, Innovate will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Monster Digital, and Monster Digital, as the parent of the surviving company, will be renamed \"Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.\" Innovate stockholders will own the substantial majority of shares of the combined company after the transaction. The common stock shares of the combined company will trade under the symbol INNT.\nAs previously disclosed, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, there will be a spin-off transaction (the \"Spin-Off\"). Previously, all of the business, assets and certain of the liabilities of Monster that are not assumed by Innovate in connection with the Merger were transferred into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, MD Holding Co., Inc. (\"Holdco\"). Further to the Spin-Off, holders of record of the Company's common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will receive a pro rata distribution of one share of Holdco's private company common stock for each share of Monster common stock held.\n\u201cWe are actively engaged with Innovate and remain committed to the reverse merger. We continue to work diligently and cooperatively with Innovate to close the transaction as soon as possible,\u201d said David Clarke, CEO of Monster Digital. Commenting on the Merger, Innovate's CEO Christopher P. Prior, Ph.D., stated: \"We are working closely with Monster Digital towards the Closing.\"\nMonster Digital announces significant corporate developments\nPotential for Common stock to be delisted. Monster Digital today announced that it has determined that it will be unable to regain compliance for continued listing of its common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market by the previously reported January 3, 2018 deadline set by The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC Hearings Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d).While the Company has been working diligently with Innovate to complete the Merger, the Company and Innovate, as reported above, have determined that they will be unable to achieve these objectives prior to the January 3, 2018 deadline.\nThe Company has requested that the Panel grant a further extension of the deadline until January 26, 2018. The Company can give no assurance that the Panel will grant such an extension. If the Panel does not grant the Company\u2019s requested extension, based on the listing requirements of NASDAQ, the Company\u2019s common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company's common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol \u201cMSDI.\u201d The Company has filed an application and is taking the steps necessary to have its common stock Quote: d for trading in the OTCQB US Market (\u201cOTCQB\u201d), operated by OTC Markets, Inc., under the same trading symbol of \u201cMSDI.\u201d The Company expects to hear back from the Panel by the end of this week, but cannot give any assurance that a decision will be reached by then. If the Panel does not grant an extension and the Company\u2019s common stock is delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, trading will commence on the OTCQB the next trading day.\nTo the extent that the Company\u2019s common stock is delisted and following commencement of trading of its common stock on the OTCQB, the Company\u2019s common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act and the Company will continue to file financial reports that will be available on the SEC's website, www.sec.gov .\nSettlement Agreement with Monster, Inc. Monster Digital and Monster Inc., (formally known as Monster Cable Products, Inc.) announced that they have entered into a settlement agreement providing for the early termination of the License Agreement for the \u201cMonster\u201d names and trademarks. Pursuant to the new understanding, Monster Digital will cease using the Monster names and trademarks on or before February 1, 2018.

Larazotide successfully completed the End of Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA to prepare for expected Phase 3 clinical trials for larazotide in celiac disease in 2018. In clinical studies in more than 800 patients, larazotide demonstrated a favorable safety profile comparable to placebo, due to what Innovate believes is its lack of systemic absorption from the small bowel. Larazotide has received Fast Track designation from the FDA.\nLarazotide, an oral peptide formulated into a capsule, has a mechanism of action that decreases intestinal permeability and regulates tight junctions by reducing antigen trafficking across epithelial cells in the intestines. Innovate believes that larazotide is the only drug in the clinic with this mechanism of action of reducing intestinal permeability. Increased intestinal permeability, sometimes referred to as \"leaky gut,\" has been widely recognized in the literature as a gateway to multiple autoimmune diseases, including celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and several others.\nFor more information, please visit http:\/\/www.innovatebiopharma.com\nForward-Looking Statements:\nSome of the statements in this press release are \"forward-looking\" and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The company has been able to prohibit this on Android, PC, and Mac devices, but says it has been unable to do the same until now on iOS ones. \nIn a news release on Wednesday morning, Confide described the new feature called \u201cScreenShield\u201d as a patented technological breakthrough and said it will license the anti-screenshot feature to other apps: \nScreenShield is a patent-pending technology that allows you to view an app\u2019s content on your screen but prevents you from taking a screenshot of it. If you try to take a screenshot on Confide, you will now simply capture a blank screen. ScreenShield also protects against other forms of screen capture, including iOS 11 screen recording, AirPlay screen mirroring, QuickTime screen recording as well as taking screenshots from the app switcher or by using Xcode. [\u2026] \nWe initially developed ScreenShield for Confide, but quickly realized that it could be used in a large number of apps\u200a\u2014\u200afar more than we could build ourselves. That\u2019s why we created ScreenShieldKit \u200a\u2014\u200ato offer the ScreenShield technology to 3rd-party developers for use in a variety of different apps and categories. \nIn a phone interview with Fortune , Confide CEO Jon Brod said the technology was developed in part from software tools for anti-piracy initiatives that help Apple developers (aapl) prevent users capturing videos. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. \nApple did not respond to a request for comment about Confide\u2019s technology. \nThe introduction of ScreenShield comes amid a general resurgence of Confide, which first appeared on the scene several years ago as a sort of Snapchat aimed at the corporate set. The app never really took off, however, until late 2016 following the election of President Donald Trump when it was embraced by political staffers looking to communicate on the sly. \nThe publicity about its use among White House aids helped spur further adoption, and Brod says it is also catching on with lawyers, HR managers, and other professionals. He declined, however, to provide details about its user numbers or revenue projections. \nBrod also says it has addressed issues over Confide\u2019s encryption technology, which was criticized as vulnerable early last year by security researchers.

The company posted a net loss when factoring in a tax hit, largely because of a one-time charge for bringing overseas profits back to the U.S. \nThe investment bank titan also beat on revenue, reporting $7.83 billion against estimates of $7.61 billion. \nHowever, trading revenues in the critical fixed income, currencies and commodities space plunged, falling 50 percent from a year ago. Trading revenue overall was down 34 percent. \nThe numbers come as Goldman looks to transition out of its long-time perch atop the trading business into other lines. Mergers and acquisitions continues to be a mainstay for the firm as it held its No.1 ranking on Wall Street, but the move away from the core business is coming with a cost. \nShares fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday as investors reacted to the poor trading results, as well as an update on the bank's tax rate this year. Goldman executives said on conference call that its effective tax rate will be 24 percent, higher than some on Wall Street had assumed would be the case in the wake of the tax reform bill. \nThe stock is up just 5.8 percent over the past year, during a time when the S&P 500 surged 22 percent as investors have been slow to warm to the new Goldman business model. \n\"That FICC trading number was shocking,\" Gerard Cassidy, managing director at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC. \"Their FICC trading numbers are so much weaker than their competitors.\" \nIn a news release, Goldman said trading was \"a challenging environment characterized by low levels of volatility and low client activity.\" Equities revenue also fell by 14 percent. \n\"Last year, we delivered higher revenue and stronger pre-tax margins despite a challenging environment for our market-making businesses,\" Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chairman and CEO, said in a statement. \n\"With the global economy poised to accelerate, new U.S. tax legislation providing tailwinds and a leading franchise across our businesses, we are well positioned to serve our clients and make significant progress on the growth plan we outlined in September,\" he added. \nLike its peers on Wall Street, Goldman had to take a paper writedown due to the tax reform legislation Congress passed in December. Including its $4.4 billion tax hit, the firm suffered a loss of $5.51 a share. \nGoldman did see a stellar quarter in its investment banking operations, which saw $2.14 billion in net revenues for the quarter and $7.37 billion for a year, its second best ever. \nInvestment management also continued to be strong, producing $1.66 billion for the quarter, a 4 percent gain from 2016, with the full-year total of $6.22 billion reflecting a 7 percent increase."}

He pointed to bullish momentum in the chart. \n\"We're still very much in an uptrend. We've corrected right back to the uptrend support line. It looks, to us ... purely based upon the charts ... we could see a measured move up to $230 on Netflix,\" Johnson said Tuesday on CNBC's \" Trading Nation .\" \nThe stock rose 55 percent last year, and is up 7 percent in 2018 thus far. The upside comes on the back of bullish analyst coverage out Tuesday morning. Equity analysts at Macquarie upgraded Netflix, raising the firm's rating to outperform from neutral. Analyst Tim Nollen raised price targets on the stock, as well. \n\"We are upgrading NFLX from Neutral to Outperform as part of a broad realignment of views on media, where we prefer companies with subscription over ad-driven content, and scaled distribution with an international presence,\" Nollen wrote in a note to clients, adding that the company has \"changed the way people watch TV\" in an ever-changing media landscape. \nMeanwhile, a shift in the way people consume media at large played a part in Nollen's Disney upgrade in a separate research note, in which the stock's price target and rating were raised. \n\"In an increasingly concentrated space where content is still king but now requires direct-to-consumer distribution, Disney has by far the highest chance of success, in our view,\" the analyst wrote, adding the Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox marriage is a positive factor. \nAt this juncture, in the media space, Disney is the clear pick over Netflix if investors are considering the two stocks, said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, who primarily looks at value names over growth. \nTo be sure, Disney underperformed the broader market in 2017, rising 3 percent in a raging bull market, while Netflix shares gained 55 percent. \n\"I would prefer Disney over Netflix. I do know it's an old media company; it's a quality company with quality assets. The real issue is that the entire industry of entertainment is now having these new competitors come in, like the Amazons of the world, Netflix and Google. So the distribution channels have completely changed,\" Morganlander said Tuesday on \"Trading Nation.\" \n\"We do like Disney. From a valuation perspective it makes sense, from a credit rating perspective it makes sense. Netflix, on the other hand ... we're value investors. That's more of a momentum name. It is a platform that we believe strongly in over 10 years. We just think that it needs the earnings to fill in, the free cash flow to fill in before we become a little bit more optimistic on that name,\" he said. \nShares of Netflix rallied 2 percent Wednesday, while Disney shares were modestly higher."}

A pharmacy employee dumps pills into a pill counting machine as she fills a prescription while working at a pharmacy in New York December 23, 2009. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson \nSoaring U.S. prices for both branded and generic drugs have sparked public outrage and government investigations over the past few years. \n\u201cDrug price increases are somewhat more constrained in 2017 and 2018 than they have been previously,\u201d Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said. \nAllergan Inc ( AGN.N ) raised prices on 18 different drugs, including dry eye treatment Restasis and irritable bowel syndrome drug Linzess, by 9.5 percent, according to a research note released by Jefferies on Tuesday. \nJefferies cited data collected by Medi-Span Price Rx and refers to list price increases, before potentially significant discounts and rebates that drugmakers provide to win preferred coverage by insurers. Medi-Span did not respond to requests to confirm the data. \nAllergan\u2019s chief executive, Brent Saunders, in late 2016 pledged to keep price increases below 10 percent as part of what he called the company\u2019s \u201cSocial Contract with Patients.\u201d \nAllergan spokesman Mark Marmur said the increases will be the only ones taken on those brands in 2018, adding that discounts to various payers should bring the actual increases to consumers down to the low single digits. \nOther drugmakers raising prices include Amgen Inc ( AMGN.O ), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc ( TEVA.TA ) ( TEVA.N ) and Horizon Pharma ( HZNP.O ), according to Jefferies and Cowen. Amgen raised the price on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis drug Enbrel by 9.7 percent and Teva increased prices on its ProAir HFA and ProAir RespiClick asthma inhalers by 6 and 3 percent, respectively. \nDrug price increases are coming under more scrutiny from states. California Governor Jerry Brown in October signed legislation requiring drug manufacturers to give 60-day notice if prices are raised more than 16 percent over a two-year period. \nShares of Allergan rose 4.1 percent on Tuesday, while Teva and Horizon Pharma shares were up 0.8 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.

Saleh\u2019s General People\u2019s Congress party accused the Houthis of trying to monopolise running the country. \nThe Houthis said Aqeeli and several of his aides were injured in the blast, describing Aqeeli\u2019s injuries as serious. \nHadi appointed Aqeeli last September, replacing Major General Mohammed al-Maqdeshi, who was appointed as a presidential adviser. \nThe United Arab Emirates news agency WAM reported earlier this week that local Yemeni fighters in the southwest, backed by Emirati forces, killed dozens of armed Houthi group members and cut one of their main supply routes to the country\u2019s third largest city of Taiz. \nThe Houthis, who have swept across Yemen since 2014 and overthrew Hadi\u2019s internationally-recognised government in 2015, hold the capital Sanaa and much of northern Yemen, where most of the country\u2019s 25 million people live. \nThe conflict - widely seen as a proxy war between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran - has displaced more than 2 million people, caused a cholera epidemic and pushed the country to the brink of famine.

(1608 GMT) Dealmaking talk has put Fiat Chrysler on a roll but for some investors it's safer to play the story through Exor, the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family which controls the automaker along with big holdings in other valuable assets including truck maker CNH Industrial , reinsurer Partner RE and Ferrari. Among them is Andrea Scauri, fund manager at Milan-based Ifigest. \"Exor's 30 percent discount to NAV is higher than the average. Considering that there is also the optionality that CNH could sells assets, I believe Exor offers more long-term value and lower volatility than Fiat at the moment,\" he says. Scauri adds that Exor could benefit from an increase in premiums at Partner Re following damages linked to hurricanes in the U.S. While Fiat has gained 24 percent in just four days, Exor has gained a respectable 13 percent. (Danilo Masoni) FIAT CHRYSLER RACES HIGHER IN HEAVY VOLUMES AS AUTOS EXCITEMENT DRIVES TRADING (1436 GMT) The Italian carmaker's shares are on a dizzying ride, up 24 percent in just four days, as dealmaking bets drive autos even higher. A Morgan Stanley note yesterday talked up Fiat's Jeep brand and the possibility of a spin-off, boosting its shares higher. Here's our story on Jeep growth expectations from yesterday: Investors are certainly piling into the stock: no fewer than 100 million shares - around 10 percent of the stock's free float - have changed hands in the past four days of trading. \"Something is cooking,\" says a London-based trader focusing in special situations. Also helping drive the autos sector sharply higher is Continental, boosted to a record high by a report on a possible breakup of the car parts maker. For what it's worth over (nearly) six days of trading, the autos sector is easily Europe's best-performing so far in 2018. (Helen Reid) BANKING MERGERS: A LITTLE LESS CONVERSATION, PLEASE?

Earlier on we told you about two big Chinese beer firms raising prices in their country. Well today we also have two brokers saying luxury groups will have stronger pricing power going forward following a 2017 driven mainly by volume growth. \"2018 will see a return of pricing power for some players. The recent price increases at industry leaders such as Gucci, Chanel and Hermes seem to confirm that trend,\" says Berenberg.

De-Meyer, who had worked for Solomon from 2008 to 2016, had admitted to his boss he took the wine during a meeting with him and his wife at a Manhattan hotel that November, the day before he fled the U.S.\nHe traveled in Italy, Brazil, Argentina, Switzerland and Morocco and was issued a 10-year visa in Brazil in 2016, according to FBI agent Elizabeth Rivas, who testified on Wednesday about De-Meyer's arrest at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday night. The FBI tracked his movements using bank records and ATM withdrawals, she said.\nSolomon's wife provided a sworn statement that she, her husband and De-Meyer met at the hotel in New York that November. During that meeting, De-Meyer admitted to taking the wine. They talked about possible prosecution, FBI Agent Rivas said Wednesday, and Solomon wouldn't guarantee that the FBI would not be involved.\nDe-Meyer was supposed to meet Solomon's wife at a bank the next day to pay them back but he never showed up, instead fleeing the country, Rivas said. In a recorded phone call to Solomon's wife after that day, he admitted again he took the wine and had left for Rome.\nThe FBI agent says De-Meyer denied using a fake name, as he was accused of doing in an indictment unsealed Wednesday by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. The Los Angeles judge ordered De-Meyer to be detained and sent to the federal court in Manhattan, where he was charged by a grand jury.\nDe-Meyer, 40, has no stable employment, the Los Angeles judge said in a hearing Wednesday afternoon, and there was a concern he would not show up in New York for court.\nDe-Meyer took hundreds of bottles of wine from Solomon's personal collection, including seven of a rare French Burgundy that Solomon had acquired for more than $133,000, the indictment said. As a member of Solomon's household staff, one of De-Meyer's jobs had been to receive wine shipments at the executive's New York apartment and then to transfer wine from the New York residence to a property in the Hamptons.\nInstead, the grand jury indictment said, he used the fake name \"Mark Miller\" to sell stolen bottles to a North Carolina wine dealer.\nThe discovery of missing bottles in the collection appears to coincide with the sale of Solomon's New York apartment in November 2016 for $21.5 million. That apartment was described as having Central Park views and a 1,000-bottle wine storage area."}

FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - Europa League - Everton vs Atalanta - Goodison Park, Liverpool, Britain - November 23, 2017 Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini celebrates after the match Action Images via Reuters\/Carl Recine \nThe Bergamo-based team have reinvented themselves after losing three key players from the side which finished a best-ever fourth last year, confounding observers who had expected to see them back in the lower reaches of the table. \nOnce again, credit is being given to coach Gian Piero Gasperini who has bounced back from a low point in his career which saw him sacked by Inter Milan after five games and, incredibly, fired twice by Palermo in the space of a month. \nIn his 18 months at Atalanta, the 59-year-old has restored his reputation both as one of Italy\u2019s most tactically astute coaches and as a specialist at working with young players -- even if he admits he is not one of the game\u2019s great innovators. \n\u201cI\u2018m a coach who imitates and uses a little bit of everything,\u201d he said in a recent interview with UEFA.com. \n\u201cI not one who invents things but I have learned from so many different situations. I copy and transform things, trying to give them my own interpretation.\u201d CUP RUNS \nAtalanta are often found in the lower reaches of Serie A and last season was their first top 10 finish since 2007-08. Their only major title was the Coppa Italia, back in 1963. \nTheir relative success last season followed Gasperini\u2019s decision to give a chance to young players such as central defender Mattia Caldara and midfielders Roberto Gagliardini and Franck Kessie. \nCaldara is the only one of those still at the club, Gagliardini having left for Inter Milan a year ago with Kessie departing for AC Milan in the summer along with Andrea Conti, another key player. \nHowever, Atalanta spent wisely in the summer, signing Marten de Roon, defender Timothy Castagne and Bryan Cristante, among others. Equally importantly, they held on to their inspirational Argentine playmaker Alejandro Gomez. \nThey bounced back from two early Serie A defeats, fighting back to draw 2-2 with titleholders Juventus and winning 2-0 at AC Milan and are ninth in the table with 27 points. \nBut it has been in the cup competitions where they have excelled. They won 2-1 at Napoli on Tuesday to reach the last four of the Coppa Italia. \nThey also topped their group in the Europa League, notching 3-0 and 5-1 wins over Everton on the way. \n\u201cWe have shown that we are a team with personality,\u201d said Gasperini. \nRoma, on the other hand, are fourth and have slipped nine points behind leaders Napoli after a lacklustre run which has seen striker Edin Dzeko hit a barren patch. \n\u201cHe\u2019s creating great chances but sometimes he\u2019s not able to turn them into goals,\u201d said Roma coach Eusebio Di Francesco after the 1-1 draw with Sassuolo. \n\u201cHe\u2019s still an important player for us and I hope he can rediscover his scoring form \u2013 it\u2019s important to keep playing him in that regard.\u201d Writing by Brian Homewood in Bern; Editing by Keith Weir"}

Digital ordering represents 53 percent of all delivery orders, up from 33 percent in 2013, according to NPD. Chris Goodney | Bloomberg | Getty Images The Yelp app on a mobile phone. \nLevelUp is making it easier for restaurants to connect with customers on the digital platforms they're already using. \nThe technology company said Tuesday it has created a new service for restaurants to upload menus and offer order and pay and rewards programs to customers on multiple digital platforms using only one form. \nDubbed \"Broadcast,\" the service acts as a middleman between the restaurants and sites like Facebook , Messenger, Yelp, Foursquare, Amazon Alexa, Chase Pay, Apple Pay and Android Pay . With Broadcast, restaurants won't have to create one-on-one relationships with every digital ordering company. Instead, their information is uploaded and formatted to suit the style of each platform. \n\"LevelUp Broadcast enables consumers to discover nearby restaurants, browse the menu, place an order, pay and collect rewards, all directly within the channels where they already live, work and play, and at the very moment when they are actively seeking lunch or dinner options,\" Seth Priebatsch, founder and CEO, LevelUp, said in a statement. \"And because customers spend up to 50 percent more on digital orders than on orders placed in-restaurant or by phone, restaurants that use Broadcast are not only capturing new guests, but also high ticket sales.\" \nWhen ordering digitally, customers have more time to consider their options, and restaurants are better able to upsell. Upselling is technique where a restaurant offers upgrades or add-ons to meals at a regular or discounted price in an attempt to ring up a higher sale. \nAccording to the most recent data available from NPD, digital ordering represents 53 percent of all delivery orders, up from 33 percent in 2013. \nBroadcast was created to reduce friction for restaurant operators as they adopt digital ordering. The service aims to help drive transactions, increase speed of service and bolster brand loyalty by targeting diners within the platforms that they are already using. \n\"At Mama Fu's, we are thrilled to be working with LevelUp as we build our digital presence and give guests new ordering options,\" Joshua Churnick, director of marketing at Mama Fu's, said in a statement. \"Having the added visibility on so many digital channels is a no-brainer for our customer acquisition strategy.\" \nAustin, Texas-based Mama Fu's operates a small chain of Asian fast-casual restaurants.

FILE PHOTO: Protesters hold signs against U.S. President Donald Trump's limited travel ban, approved by the U.S. Supreme Court, in New York City, U.S., June 29, 2017. REUTERS\/Joe Penney\/File Photo \nEven without legislative action, however, the number of immigrants approved for family-based visas has dropped this year to the lowest level in more than a decade, a Reuters review of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data shows. The drop has not been previously reported. \nFor a graphic on chain migration, click tmsnrt.rs\/2CaWNJb \nThe Trump administration has taken a series of measures to more closely scrutinize legal immigration. These steps have been overshadowed by Trump\u2019s more public efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, such as his calls for a wall along the Mexican border and more arrests of people living in the country illegally. \nLately though, Trump has increasingly been taking aim at chain migration, saying it allows a single immigrant \u201cto bring in dozens of increasingly distant relations,\u201d with \u201cno real selection criteria.\u201d He said a Bangladeshi man who set off a homemade pipe bomb in a crowded New York City commuter hub in December was a prime example of the dangers of the system. \nImmigration advocates counter that no one automatically qualifies for a visa because a relative is already in the United States. All immigrants undergo security vetting and can face years-long waits before they are given a green light. \nThe intensified focus on chain migration has been accompanied by an overall slowdown in adjudications of family-based visas, known as I-130s, the Reuters review shows. \nThe number of approvals dropped by nearly a quarter in the first nine months of 2017 to around 406,000 compared to the same period a year earlier when approvals were more than 530,000, despite a similar number of applications during both periods, USCIS data showed. \nThe drop was even starker when looking only at I-130s approved for relatives who were not immediate family members. Those fell by 70 percent in the same period, from more than 108,000 in the first nine months of 2016 to 32,500 in the same period in 2017. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2CaWNJb ). The entire 2017 fiscal year had the lowest number of approvals for extended family visas since 2000. \nUSCIS said that since there are a limited number of visas for this category, it prioritizes processing visas that are more immediately available. The agency also said there are normal year-to-year fluctuations in the number of visas that are filed and decided. \nAt the core of the administration\u2019s long-term policy goal is a belief that immigration should be merit-based. \n\u201cThose people are just coming in based on connection to a family member,\u201d the new director of USCIS, L. Francis Cissna said in a telephone interview, referring to chain migrants. \u201cThat lack of selectivity; it takes us away from where we want to go as a country.\u201d \nCissna said no specific policy guidance has been put in place at USCIS to change the way family-based visas are issued. He also said there were no plans to restrict visas for immediate family members and pointed out that approvals of visas and citizenship applications overall are still high. \nHe has said, however, that his agency is looking closely at all visa categories to root out fraud. USCIS said separately that closer scrutiny could lead to longer processing times.

[nL2N1LY0F5] \nUSCIS has also put in place new interview requirements for U.S. citizens seeking to bring over their fianc\u00e9s. In the first nine months of 2017, approvals of fianc\u00e9 visas dropped by 35 percent over the same period a year earlier, the Reuters data review found. \n\u2018ONTO THE MAIN STAGE\u2019 Slideshow (2 Images) \nImmigration supporters said any efforts by the administration to restrict the entry of family members of migrants was shortsighted. They \u201cbring drive and entrepreneurial spirit to the United States,\u201d said Steve Yale-Loehr, an immigration law expert at Cornell University. \nChain migration has long been a target of groups that favor more restrictions on legal immigration. The idea, supported by organizations like NumbersUSA, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), failed to gain much traction at the highest levels of power in Washington before Trump took office. \n\u201cWe have been talking about this for a long time but we were kind of out there in the wilderness\u201d said Ira Mehlman from FAIR. \u201cIt was never at this level of discussion before.\u201d \nNow supporters of the ideas of restricting chain migration and tightening standards for legal immigration occupy key positions in the administration. They include Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who remains vocal on the issue, and his long-time aide Stephen Miller, who is now one of Trump\u2019s closest policy advisers. \nThe current USCIS ombudsman Julie Kirchner was previously the executive director of FAIR. \nThe White House and the Department of Justice did not respond to questions about the influence of the groups, which critics say are anti-immigrant, on administration policy. \nJessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at CIS, said she and her colleagues \u201care in fairly regular contact with various administration officials as they solicit suggestions and ideas to improve policies.\u201d She said she had also spoken to officials in the Obama administration, but only occasionally. \nEarlier this month NumbersUSA launched a national advertising campaign against chain migration. A day later the White House posted a presentation on the same subject making many of the same points. \nNumbersUSA director Roy Beck said any similarity in the points was just a coincidence. Still, he is thrilled that his group\u2019s ideas on restricting legal immigration have been \u201ccatapulted onto the main stage in an unprecedented way,\u201d he said in an interview. \nIn April, Trump signed an executive order directing agencies to draft new rules and guidance for the legal immigration system. In August, the White House backed the RAISE Act, proposed legislation sponsored by two Republican lawmakers, that aimed to cut legal immigration by 50 percent over 10 years.

But America First does mean working with the rest of the world,\" Mnuchin said. \"It just means that President Trump is looking out for American workers and American interests no different than he expects other leaders would look out for their own.\" show chapters"}

A key dollar index hit a 3-1\/2-month low, weighed by expectations of a slower pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve amid a tepid U.S. inflation picture. Fewer U.S. rate hikes than expected could help support demand for higher-yielding emerging market assets, which are seen as riskier than dollar bonds. Mexico's peso gained more than 1 percent. Investors are betting that Mexico's central bank could raise borrowing costs again in February after hiking last month, according to yields on Mexican interest rate swaps. Mexico's peso tumbled to its weakest in about 10 months in December, hurt by concerns that talks between Mexico, the United States and Canada could fail to broker a new free trade agreement. Banco Base said in a note on Monday the peso would be vulnerable to more losses ahead on free-trade jitters and could sink past 20 per dollar in the coming weeks. Also on Tuesday, a key factory index in China rose to a four-month high in December, confounding forecasts for a decline, and backing bets on resilience for the world's largest consumer of commodities, which are key exports of Latin American countries. Currencies from Brazil and Colombia strengthened close to 2 percent. Stock indexes were up throughout the region, with Brazil's benchmark Bovespa leading gains as traders unwound bets on a credit downgrade.

Cramer also sat down with the CEO of Splunk to get the latest on big data. In the lightning round, Cramer brushed off Intel's chip issues. 20 Hours Ago | 01:20 \nCNBC's Jim Cramer thinks the consumer is still underappreciated in this stock market despite strong data from the retailers' fourth quarters. \n\"While the new tax regime will be very favorable for the retailers and restaurants, it's a one-time change; a year from now we'll anniversary the new numbers and that will be that. What matters even more, though, right now, is how business is actually doing as measured by the top line, the revenue line,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \nAnd, thanks to a robust holiday season, the revenue lines for businesses like Tiffany , Home Depot , Kohl's and Walmart are starting to benefit from the pickup in consumer spending. \n\"When it comes to revenue, the consumer spending factor [is] the new wild card, and it's playing out in spectacular fashion,\" Cramer said. \"You throw in the fact that we have a weak dollar and it's clear everything is coming up roses for this sector, far rosier than the stocks.\" Apple's 'Marshall Plan' Brendan McDermid | Reuters Apple CEO Tim Cook \nWhile Cramer would be happy to talk about the tax benefits and windfall of bonuses that came from Washington's new tax law , he'd rather talk about Apple . \n\"Apple, using some of the gigantic $252 billion cash hoard that it has overseas, announced [Wednesday] what I think is a modern-day Marshall Plan for the U.S. economy,\" Cramer said. \" Apple committed to directly investing $350 billion into the United States over the next five years, including $38 billion in repatriation taxes.\" \nCramer was referencing the United States' 1948 initiative in which the Truman administration devoted $140 billion, adjusted for inflation, to rebuilding Western Europe after World War II. \nIn some ways, Apple CEO Tim Cook's thinking was bigger than General George Marshall's, Cramer argued after a phone conversation with Cook himself. Bank roundup Scott Mlyn | CNBC A Bank of America branch in New York. \nCramer firmly believes that the financial stocks are the most important leadership group in the market, so he wanted to check in with some of its biggest players after earnings. \nWhen Cramer told viewers what to look for from the banks' earnings reports last week, he anticipated the hefty, one-time charges many of them incurred to take advantage of newly enacted tax laws . \n\"I know it was pure accounting gimmickry, but I worried that it might freak out investors. Turns out there was no need to worry,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \" J.P. Morgan , Bank of America , Wells Fargo and Citigroup all delivered substantial earnings beats, even as only J.P. Morgan and Citi actually gave you that higher-than-expected revenue that I like to see.\" \nFor Cramer, the \"headline numbers\" \u2014 how the earnings and revenue results compared to analysts' estimates \u2014 were less important than the banks' net interest margins , loan growth and capital return plans. Energy guru talks future of natural gas Scott Mlyn | CNBC Charif Souki \nEnergy guru Charif Souki, the chairman and co-founder of Tellurian , told CNBC on Wednesday that the natural gas industry is going to need a major fund infusion to keep drilling. \n\"We have so much natural gas in this country,\" Souki told Cramer . \"Just the amount of gas that is already behind pipe, or that is going to be found because of oil production at $60 a barrel, is going to require over $150 billion of infrastructure investment over the next five years.\" \nSouki, formerly CEO of Cheniere Energy, co-founded Tellurian to take advantage of the industry's need for low-cost liquefied natural gas. Splunk CEO talks big data challenges Scott Mlyn | CNBC Doug Merritt, CEO, Splunk \nGathering and interpreting big data is proving challenging for many high-profile businesses, Splunk President and CEO Doug Merritt told Cramer on Wednesday. \n\"I meet with hundreds of customers every single year and they're all wrestling with that challenge of big data's growing like crazy and how, ultimately, to get insights,\" the CEO said. \"But that starts, in the very beginning, [with] what data do we even look for? How do I find big data? What are sources of big data? Then, how do I correlate these colliding streams that are hard to make sense from so I can get those insights and take action?\" \nSplunk, which manages data for massive companies like Mercedes parent Daimler AG, is a leader in machine data, a segment Merritt said is growing 50 times faster than \"traditional business data.\" \n\"Splunk distinguishes itself on a couple of differentiated axes,\" Merritt said. \"The first \u2026 is scale. Our bigger customers are ingesting petabytes of data per day \u2013 petabytes per day. It takes 2 million active users on the internet to drive a petabyte of data, so it's a massive scale. And it's not just that ingest piece \u2013 it's how do I get real-time information? The whole power of machine data is I've got to get quick response times so I can sense and respond.\" Lightning round: INTC's troubles will soon be gone \nIn Cramer's lightning round , he flew through his take on some callers' favorite stocks: \nIntel : \"That stuff [about faulty chips] is nonsense. There was some degradation. It will not even matter. You will not look back. You will not be able to see why that stock went down. I trust [CEO] Brian Krzanich. He's a good man. If he tells me the problem's solved, the problem is solved.\" \nExelon Corporation : \"No, I prefer to make [mad money] in Dominion , American Electric Power , which has come down a great deal, or ConEd , which has also gotten hammered.\" \nQuestions for Cramer?

Georgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency in part of the state, while Florida Governor Rick Scott ordered warming shelters opened for residents.\nIn historic Charleston, South Carolina, the winter storm shuttered carriage horse tour companies on Wednesday, city spokesman Jack O\u2018Toole said. A day earlier, a carriage horse slipped and fell on a patch of ice during a tour.\nResidents in nearby Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, on Tuesday headed to grocery stores in droves to stock up on food and supplies at local groceries, according to Nicholas Nichols, an employee at Publix grocery store.\n\u201cThey did restock last night. They were here until 4 in the morning,\u201d Nichols said.\nThe wintry mix and low wind chills could cause widespread power outages and leave roads icy, making commuting treacherous for millions of Americans from northern Florida to southern Virginia, the National Weather Service said in a series of warnings.\nSome schools and universities in those states were closed on Wednesday in anticipation of the storm. Many flights out of the Savannah\/Hilton Head International Airport in Georgia and Tallahassee Airport in Florida were canceled.\nThe weather service said its Tallahassee office measured a snow and sleet accumulation of 0.1 inch (2.5mm) on its roof early in the day, the first time Florida\u2019s capital has had snow in nearly 30 years.\nA pedestrian crosses a street on a frigid morning as the sun rises in New York, U.S., January 3, 2018.

Forecasters warned that snow would fall quickly, at a rate of several inches per hour, during the day, with the storm intensified by the \u201cbombogenesis\u201d effect, according to private forecaster Accuweather.\nThat effect, also known as a \u201cbomb cyclone,\u201d was first described in a 1980 scientific paper by the late Fred Sanders, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It occurs when a storm\u2019s barometric pressure drops by 24 millibars in 24 hours, greatly strengthening the storm.\nFlorida Governor Scott said cold weather shelters have either opened or would be opened in 22 of the state\u2019s 67 counties.\nSome coastal areas of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia could ultimately receive up to 6 inches (15 cm) of snow and ice, while parts of New England could see 12 to 15 inches (30-38 cm) of snow and wind gusts of 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour) by the end of week, the weather service said.\nAn arctic air mass will remain entrenched over the eastern two-thirds of the United States through the end of the week, forecasters said. The record-low temperatures were to blame for at least eight deaths in Texas, Wisconsin, West Virginia, North Dakota and Michigan over the past several days, officials said.\nReporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee and Harriet McLeod in Charleston, South Carolina; Additional reporting by Gina Cherelus in New York and Scott Malone in Boston; Editing by Jeremy Gaunt and Jonathan Oatis\n "}

However, he's forced to walk away from making a deal when he learns one of Rayjus' co-owners, Ray Odom, has a side job as a controversial local radio personality.\nMuch to Lemonis' astonishment, Odom says the character he portrays on the radio is \"a sexist, egotistical, racist pig,\" but clarifies he's still \"a dad in real life\" who cares about his family and employees.\nJustin Romines and Odom started Rayjus as equal partners in 2010 with the goal to bring professional-looking sports shirts to amateur fishermen. Despite having little experience in the apparel industry, Romines and Odom set up their customizable garments business and found success.\nshow chapters How a single mom of a 13-year-old CEO learned to be more confident\u2014and scored a meeting with Amazon      2:01 PM ET Tue, 19 Dec 2017 | 01:30 Rayjus quickly began making over $1 million in sales a year thanks to a niche group of fishing fans they began serving. However, because fishing is a seasonal sport, they faced unpredictable revenue.\nStill, Lemonis found the Under Armour-like dry fit shirts Rayjus produced \"really cool\" and thought they could potentially sell well at his outdoor goods stores. These custom shirts make up about 80 percent of the business and earn the business about $1 million in revenue, according to the co-owners.\nBut while the product and money-making potential were there, Lemonis quickly uncovered key issues with how the business was being run.\nHere are two lessons you can learn from Lemonis' experience.\nValue your team members or office morale will suffer When Lemonis visited the Rayjus facility, he found that it was \"quite literally a sweatshop,\" with the women sewing and creating the garments in an unairconditioned factory. Meanwhile, the rest of the men worked in air-conditioned cubicles in an adjacent part of the building. The employees also told Lemonis that there were days when the factory would be working at full speed while the rest of the men went out fishing.\n\"Maybe one of the reasons that the business is struggling is because these guys are only putting in four days of effort,\" Lemonis said.\nLemonis noted that aside from the rough physical conditions Rayjus employees faced, the owners were running the business like a \"house of cards.\" As a result of poor business margins, the company had an inadequate cash flow, causing them to fall behind not only on their taxes, but also with paying their employees on time.\nTo help compensate, Odom explained to Lemonis that he works two days a week as a local radio disc jockey.\nMake sure you know who you're working with Odom noted that despite being a \"dad in real life\" and a guy who cares about his family, his character on the radio was \"a sexist, egotistical, racist pig.\"\n\"I knew Ray had a side job and I thought it may be a distraction, but I didn't realize that the focus of it was to demonize minorities and degrade women,\" Lemonis said.\nOnce Lemonis learned Odom made a living by telling people he's a sexist and a racist, he said he felt \"uncomfortable really fast.\"\n\"I am a big believer that you are who you do business with,\" Lemonis told Romines and Odom. \"And so the fact that you think I would do business with you because you do that, whether it's your personality or not, I just can't.\"\nAfter walking through the facilities, meeting the Rayjus employees and learning more about the business' day-to-day operations, Lemonis couldn't bring himself to continue helping Rayjus.\nshow chapters Marcus Lemonis gives Tumbleweed Tiny House CEO leadership advice to help pull this company out of million-dollar debt      1:35 PM ET Wed, 29 Nov 2017 | 01:10 \"I can get over business problems \u2014 fix the process, make it safe, put the air condition in, figure out how to pay the taxes, create a better work environment, sell more, diversify the product \u2014 I can fix those,\" Lemonis said. \"I can't fix you for being a racist and a sexist, but here's the good news: I won't have to fix it because I'm not going to be here.\" \n\nLike this story?

FILE PHOTO: Carlos Ghosn, Chairman and CEO of the Renault-Nissan Alliance, gestures as he speaks during a news conference in Paris, France, September 15, 2017. REUTERS\/Philippe Wojazer\/File Photo \nThe fund, due to be unveiled by Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn at the CES tech industry show in Las Vegas next Tuesday, will be 40 percent financed by Renault ( RENA.PA ), 40 percent by Nissan ( 7201.T ) and 20 percent by Mitsubishi ( 7211.T ). \n\u201cIt will allow us to move faster on acquisitions ahead of our competition,\u201d one of the alliance sources told Reuters. \nFrederique Le Greves, a spokeswoman for the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, declined to comment. \nThe traditional auto industry model based on individual ownership is threatened by pay-per-use services such as Uber, as well as ride- and car-sharing platforms, a challenge heightened by parallel shifts towards electrified and self-driving cars. \nWary carmakers are struggling to embrace changes and technologies that some of their executives are only beginning to grasp. To accelerate the process, many are investing directly in the new services - and gaining access to intellectual property - via their own corporate venture capital (CVC) funds. \nBMW ( BMWG.DE ) has purchased stakes in a plethora of ride-sharing, smart-charging and autonomous vehicle software firms through its 500 million euro ($600 million) iVentures fund, the biggest such in-house facility belonging to a carmaker. \nAmong others that have been increasingly active are General Motors\u2019 ( GM.N ) GM Ventures, with $240 million, and Peugeot-maker PSA Group\u2019s ( PEUP.PA ) 100 million-euro investment arm. \nCVC funds, a familiar feature of innovative sectors such as tech and pharmaceuticals, have become more commonplace among carmakers since the 2008-9 financial crisis. They let companies skip some of the formalities otherwise required for new investments, and pounce more swiftly on promising startups. \nThe Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi venture will also obviate the current need to thrash out the ownership split for each new alliance acquisition. \nIt represents a further step in the integration of the carmakers as they pursue 10 billion euros in annual synergies by 2022. France\u2019s Renault holds a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, which in turn controls Mitsubishi. Ghosn heads Renault and chairs all three. \nThe fund is being set up as a Dutch-registered joint venture headed by Francois Dossa, a former banker who led Brazil operations for Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) and then for Nissan, the same people said. They declined to discuss specific investment plans. \nDespite Nissan\u2019s ambitions to market fully autonomous cars by 2022 as well as a robo-taxi service, the Japanese carmaker has largely eschewed startups, preferring partnerships with established players such as software group DeNA Co. ( 2432.T ) \nRenault has made several such investments including Marcel, a Paris car-sharing platform, and Jedlix, a Dutch specialist in smart vehicle-charging technology. Renault\u2019s RCI Bank & Services arm took control of car-sharing aggregator Karhoo last year and plans to relaunch the business under alliance ownership. \nMost or all of the Renault investments will be transferred to the new alliance venture\u2019s portfolio, the sources said. \n($1 = 0.8286 euros)"}

Papers published between 2003 and 2015 were extracted from top medical and surgical journals including The New England Journal of Medicine, Annals of Surgery and Journal of the American College of Surgeons. \nIn randomized controlled trials, participants are assigned by chance to separate groups with the purpose of comparing a new treatment to a different treatment or a sham treatment. These studies provide the highest level of evidence and are considered the gold standard. They can last weeks, months or even years. \nWhile the U.S. led the field in absolute number of publications (157, or 23.8%), the UK, Canada and nearly all Western European countries published significantly more randomized controlled trials when adjusted for population. \nIn 2013-2015, for example, for every 100,000 citizens, the U.S. published 0.03 papers reporting on randomized controlled trials, while Canada published 0.05, the UK published 0.07, Switzerland published 0.10, and the Netherlands published 0.20. \nIn the same period, for every billion U.S. dollars spent by governments on research and development, the U.S. published 0.07 randomized controlled trials, Canada published 2.4, the Netherlands published 6.5, Switzerland published 7.4, and Denmark published 14.4. \n\u201cWe reported the total number of studies this way to normalize the publication rates,\u201d co-author Dr. Jared Forrester explained in an email. \u201cThree published studies in the United States versus the same amount in Switzerland means a very different thing given the available money and human resources.\u201d \n\u201cThere are massive problems with surgical clinical trials in the U.S.,\u201d Dr. Andrew Vickers of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City told Reuters Health in a phone interview. \u201cThey are incredibly time consuming, expensive and there are impossible regulations enacted by governing bodies necessary to overcome in order to get funded.\u201d \n\u201cThere\u2019s a need to radically shift the culture to one of simplification, in more ways than one,\u201d insists Vickers, who was not involved in the Stanford study. \nA proposal sometimes goes through no less than six ethics committees, each of which add their own modifications to the original study that must be considered before funding approval, said Vickers. \nAdding to the complexity are rigorous subject exclusion criteria and extensive documentation that make it difficult to accrue participants, which can result in trial discontinuation altogether. Furthermore, not all randomized control trials get published. \n\u201cThis is especially true when researchers\u2019 hypotheses are disproved,\u201d said coauthor Dr. Sherry Wren in a phone interview. \u201cBut a negative trial is important because it still answers questions.\u201d \n\u201cDespite the outcome, when funded, we have an obligation to deliver on our initial investment through completion of our hypothesis testing and disseminate the results,\u201d Forrester agreed. \nBy showing a decline in published randomized control trials by U.S. researchers, the authors hope to bring attention to the critical need for dedicated surgical research funds. \n\u201cIf we want to establish ourselves once again as the preeminent leaders in biomedical research, we need to rise to the occasion. This requires a strongly funded environment. We see this paper as a call-to-arms toward the current system for all U.S. based surgical researchers,\u201d Wren said. \nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2CVR6jf JAMA Surgery, online December 27, 2017."}

But after the labor report showed a distinct decline in retail jobs \u2014 which Cramer attributed to the rise of e-commerce \u2014 industrial and transport stocks caught fire.\nCramer said that the industrials likely rose because buyers hoped the Fed would be cautious with its rate hike agenda, and the transports popped because of the online shopping boom.\n\"Throw in the big pushes from the analyst community on Amazon and Apple , two of the market's generals, and you get an electric tape full of new winners all plumped up to feed the beast ,\" Cramer said.\nWith that in mind, the \"Mad Money\" host turned to the stocks and events he'll be watching in the second week of the new year:\nMonday: CES, J.P.

The stock-moving technology event will feature high-profile speakers like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who will address the conference on Sunday night.\n\"If you only read one thing about tech this year, you need to get a transcript of this speech,\" Cramer said. \"He'll trace a vision of the cloud, of machine learning, of gaming, of cryptocurrencies and data centers [and] just about everything else that matters.\"\nIntel CEO Brian Krzanich will deliver a speech the following day that Cramer hopes will end the firestorm around the security flaws in Intel's chips .\n\"I'm betting many of the doomsday scenarios about Intel that have been floating around will be debunked and over by Tuesday,\" Cramer said.\nJ.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference: Cramer will be paying close attention to Allergan CEO Brent Saunders' speech at the big bank's annual health care convention .\n\"If Brent ... tells a good story, I think it could mark the beginning of a new run for Allergan, which makes Botox along with a bunch of other aesthetic, eye care and central nervous system drugs,\" Cramer said. \"We own this one for my charitable trust ... and while we have gotten singed, I still think there's a ton of hidden value here that maybe he will unlock when he speaks on Monday.\"\nTuesday: Jamie Dimon, Schnitzer Steel Industries Jamie Dimon : The J.P. Morgan CEO will speak at his company's conference on Tuesday. While J.P. Morgan's in quiet period ahead of earnings, Cramer said his speech could still move stocks.\nSchnitzer Steel : Cramer doesn't typically pay attention to small steel plays like Schnitzer, but the company's Tuesday earnings report could shine a light on one of his biggest worries about the steel industry: the brewing tensions between Chinese and U.S. steel producers .\nWednesday: KB Home, Lennar Homebuilders KB Home and Lennar both report earnings on Wednesday, and while Cramer doesn't expect the Fed's rate hikes to affect them yet, he wasn't so bullish about the long term.\n\"I know that eventually we're going to get a rate hike \u2014 not the next one, but maybe one later this year \u2014 that will finally knock the homebuilders off their pedestals,\" he said.\nEven so, Cramer expected a \"picture of robust demand, limited supply, higher orders, and rising gross margins\" from both companies on Wednesday.\nThursday: Europe On Thursday, Cramer will look across the pond for European industrial production data. He remained bullish on the continent and suggested investors get wide exposure to its comeback.\n\"If you want to play the turn, I recommend the EZU, which is the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF that, as I tell ActionAlertsPlus.com club members, gives you broad exposure to the continent,\" Cramer said.\nFriday: BlackRock, J.P. Morgan, PNC, Wells Fargo Earnings season kicks off with a bang on Friday with major financial companies BlackRock , J.P. Morgan, PNC and Wells Fargo all reporting their latest quarterly results.\nCramer hoped to get insight on BlackRock's index fund investments, which could be driving the raging bull market, as well as J.P. Morgan's dividend and share buyback plans.\nThe \"Mad Money\" host predicted that the biggest upside surprise would come from PNC \u2014 a buyable stock even at $144, he said \u2014 and that Wells Fargo would again attempt to brush its cross-selling woes under the rug.\n\"Given that the Fed will be tightening multiple times this year and the tax rates for all these financials are coming down, I think all of these stocks are buys, particularly if they go down anytime next week,\" he said.\nFinal thoughts \"Here's the bottom line: when the market's in beast mode , you need to feed it,\" Cramer concluded. \"You give it a balanced diet of techs from CES, health cares from J.P.

But the fat fighting pill\u2019s action mechanism is intriguing. In the study, mice were given food until they became obese, and were then fed the drug, which increases the cellular metabolism of obesity-linked white fat cells. The size of these fat cells in mice given the drug shrunk 30% after 10 days of treatment compared to those given a placebo. Strikingly, the drug-taking mice\u2019s blood cholesterol levels also returned to normal. \nSubscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily , our newsletter about the most exciting health innovations. \nSenior study author Stanley Watowich notes that weight loss and obesity drugs of this kind could help prevent conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Most American children today are expected to be obese by the time they\u2019re 35, according to recent research by Harvard, compared with about 40% of U.S. adults who are currently obese. \u201cAs fat cells grow larger, they begin to overexpress a protein that acts as a metabolic brake that slows down fat cell metabolism, making it harder for these cells to burn accumulating fat,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIn addition, as the fat tissue expands, they secrete greater amounts of hormones and pro-inflammatory signals that are responsible for several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\u201d \nThe most common approaches to fighting obesity include bariatric surgery and pills ( or devices ) which suppress appetite. Accelerated fat cell metabolism would essentially tackle obesity at its root biological level, rather than simply facilitate behavioral changes. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

(NASDAQ: APOP), a developer of a novel stem cell selection technology, announced that it has successfully completed transplantation of the first group of three patients using Cellect's ApoGraft\u2122 technology in the Company's Phase I\/II clinical trial and that after one month follow-up, all three patients have demonstrated complete acceptance of the stem cell transplant with no adverse events related to the study treatment, as determined by the clinical investigator, and no reported serious adverse events or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions.\nThe Phase I\/II, dose escalating, 4-cohort, open label clinical trial of up to twelve patients is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of functionally selected donor derived mobilized peripheral blood cells that underwent the Company's ApoGraft\u2122 process and were transplanted into patients with hematological malignancies in an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The primary endpoint of the study is overall incidence, frequency and severity of adverse events potentially related to ApoGraft\u2122 at 180 days from transplantation. The Company plans on recruiting a further three patients for the second cohort of patients following review of the independent data and safety monitoring board.\nThe Company believes that these interim results of ApoGraft present the first signs of a breakthrough in stem cell transplantation. The product is transplantable within less than 12 hours from donation through a simple process performed on the bedside after selective physiological elimination of immune reaction-causing cells. The ApoGraft transplantation is intended to result in complete recovery of the patient's immune system with no related safety concerns in contrast to the significant morbidity or even death causing standard medical procedure.\nDr. Shai Yarkoni, Cellect's CEO said, \"Our ApoGraft\u2122 technology shows consistently successful results in the use of stem cell transplants for treating patients suffering from life-threatening conditions. We see our position strengthened with each patient treated. We aim for stem cell based regenerative medicine to become a safe and affordable treatment for most of mankind's diseases.\"\nStem cells are the building blocks and raw material of 21 st century regenerative medicine enabling a world where damaged tissues and organs may be replaced and regenerated rather than fixed with drugs, radiation and surgery. However, up to 50 percent of stem cell transplant procedures, such as bone marrow transplants and others, result in life-threatening rejection disease and other immune responses such as Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD). Cellect's ApoGraft\u2122 technology aims to turn stem cell transplantations into a simple and safe, yet cost effective procedure by reducing the associated severe side effects, such as rejection and many other risks.\nAbout GvHD\nDespite improved prophylactic regimens, acute GvHD disease still occurs in an estimated 25% to 50% of recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The incidence of acute or chronic GvHD in these patients is increasing due to the increased number of allogeneic transplantations survivors, older recipient age, use of alternative donor grafts and use of peripheral blood as the source of stem cells. GvHD accounts for an estimated 15% of deaths and is considered the leading cause of non-relapse mortality after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\nAbout Cellect Biotechnology Ltd.\nCellect Biotechnology (NASDAQ: APOP) has developed a breakthrough technology for the selection of stem cells from any given tissue that aims to improve a variety of stem cell-based therapies.\nThe Company's technology is expected to provide research, hospitals and pharma companies with the tools to rapidly isolate stem cells in quantity and quality allowing stem cell-based treatments and procedures in a wide variety of applications in regenerative medicine. The current clinical trial is aimed at bone marrow transplantations in cancer treatment.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements about the Company's expectations, beliefs and intentions.

Prices of the battery metal earlier touched $2,580, the highest since October 16.\n\u201cThe severe cold snap in the US -- with pictures of a nearly frozen Niagara Falls -- refocused interest on lead,\u201d said Farid Ahmed, lead analyst at consultants Wood Mackenzie.\n\u201cPlunging temperatures raise the prospect of a surge in car battery failures leading to a spike in replacement battery demand. When this coincides with tight supply and low stocks, the prospect of an acute squeeze becomes a genuine concern.\u201d\nWood Mackenzie estimates the lead market will see a deficit of 115,000 tonnes this year and 56,000 tonnes in 2019 after a 119,000 shortfall last year.\nWINTER: A major winter storm will start hitting the U.S Southeast up through New England on Wednesday with freezing rain, snow and strong winds, adding to record-shattering cold that is keeping its grip on much of the eastern United States.\nCHINA: China accounts for about 40 percent of global lead demand estimated at around 12 million tonnes this year.\nMore than 80 percent of global lead consumption is for batteries mainly for autos. The biggest supply shortfall over coming months is seen in top consumer China due to an environmental crackdown on polluting industries.\nSISTER-METAL: Lead is mined alongside zinc. Closures of major mines such as Century in Australia and Lisheen in Ireland and cutbacks by miners such as Glencore have left the market short of both metals.\nBetween 2014 and 2016 mined lead supply shrank by roughly 500,000 tonnes, or 10 percent of the global total.\n\u201cMine closures have starved the market of new supply,\u201d said Societe Generale analyst Robin Bhar.\nSTOCKS: Inventories of lead in LME approved warehouses at 142,025 tonnes are down more than 25 percent since January last year. MPBSTX-TOTAL\nPOSITIONING: Large holding of LME warrants and cash contracts <0#LME-WHC> have also reinforced concerns about availability creating a premium of $9 a tonne for the cash over the three-month contract CMPB0-3. That differential on Dec. 27 was a discount of $11 a tonne.\nDOLLAR: Weighing on industrial metals was a firmer U.S. currency, which when it rises makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for non-U.S. firms.\nPRICES: Copper slipped 0.8 percent to $7,147 a tonne, aluminium fell 1.6 percent to $2,228, zinc lost 0.7 percent to $3,326.5, tin was down 0.7 percent to $19,900 and nickel ceded 1.7 percent to $12,400.\nReporting by Pratima Desai; Editing by Mark Potter and Elaine Hardcastle\n "}

Whether it\u2019s ocean plastics, air pollution or climate change, there\u2019s a huge price to pay for every day that goes by without progress,\u201d said Leonie Cooper on the environment committee of the London Assembly - a body elected to hold the mayor\u2019s office to account.\nAt current rates, in 25 years\u2019 time, British people would have used 192.5 billion plastic bottles, she said.\nTwo-thirds of all plastic packaging in Britain ends up being landfilled or burned, according to research by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.\n\u201cThere must be better recycling systems, which avoid confusion for citizens and have better economies of scale,\u201d said Rob Opsomer of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.\nEight million tonnes of plastic - bottles, packaging and other waste - are dumped into the ocean every year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain, says the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\nIf current pollution rates continue, there will be more plastic in the sea than fish by 2050.\nEnvironment groups said the most glaring omission in May\u2019s scheme was the lack of support for deposit return schemes that pay consumers to return plastic bottles after use and are common in many parts of the world including Denmark, Germany and Australia.\nOn this issue, Scotland has taken the lead.\n\u201cThe Scottish Government has committed to a deposit return scheme covering plastic bottles, and now it is proposing a ban on the manufacture of plastic-stemmed cotton buds,\u201d said Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland in an email.\nMay said she would look at plastic bottle deposits and would launch a call for evidence next month on whether to impose taxes or charges on single use plastics.\nThis week Britain banned the use of plastic microbeads, common in body scrubs and shower gels that end up in oceans.\nThe Environmental Audit Committee, a cross-party green watchdog, has also recommended a 25 pence \u201clatte levy\u201d to be charged on top of the price of a beverage to combat the overuse of plastic-lined disposable coffee cups.\nReporting by Varsha Saraogi; Editing by Ros Russell; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.

Trump's key pitch to global political and business leaders is that America is open to their business, but on \"America first\" terms. The president has been talking up the effects of recently implemented tax cuts, including a big reduction in the corporate tax rate, but he also claims that cuts in regulations has also helped U.S. economic policy.\nHere, Trump talks about what he considers the impact of reduced regulations on U.S. gross domestic product :\nOK. Now, in my first quarter, which I consider to be the second quarter because I was there now long enough to have made an impact and don't kid yourself, regulations are just as big as the tax cuts. I've cut more regulations than any president in history and I've been here for one year. You can take their term whether it's eight years or 16 years in one instance \u2014 but you can take anybody you want, in one year, we've cut more regulations. And by the way, there's going to be regulation but they're good, solid, sane regulations. But in quarter two, we had 3.1, and in quarter three, as you know, we had 3.2. But in quarter one, which is the Obama quarter \u2014 really the last, I would say, Obama quarter, you had 1.2. We were going in the wrong direction.\nHere, the president talks about how he sees his regulatory approach enticing companies to bring business to the U.S.\nBut I also want these great companies that are coming in \u2013 Toyota 's now coming in. We talked already about Apple . Apple's coming in with a very big presence. We had many companies \u2013 Chrysler's coming in, leaving Mexico and coming back to Michigan. I mean, how good is that? When was the last time you heard that? And without me being here and without what we've been doing including regulation, by the way, because I happen to think that regulation is as big as the tax cuts, OK? I think the tax cuts are incredible. But I think the regulations, the cutting of regulations \u2014 because the businesses couldn't even \u2014 they couldn't do anything. They were totally bound. You'd have to get 16 different approvals from 15 different agencies. Hey Joe, it was impossible to do business. And I think you know that maybe better than anybody. The cutting of the regulations was every bit as important as what we did with the tax cuts. But you put them both together and we have a dynamic country again. I mean, everybody's talking.

But, according to one widely followed technician, the long boom could be heading for a bust.\nPiper Jaffray's Craig Johnson says bond yields are entering a \"danger zone\" as they approach 2.60 percent.\n\"When you've had these major inflection points in interest rates, they've corresponded pretty well with the starts and ends of secular bull and bear markets,\" he told CNBC's \" Trading Nation \" on Thursday. \"I have to question whether bond investors [and] central banks ... can make this smooth transition from a downward sloping interest rate environment to an upward sloping environment and not see this market stumble.\"\nBond prices and yields move inversely to each other.\nTake the bond market spook-out Wednesday when reports of China possibly curtailing its purchases of U.S. Treasurys sent bond yields sharply higher. The yield on the 10-year approached a 10-month high of just under 2.60 percent on Wednesday on those fears that China may pull back on its U.S. bond buying.\nAccording to Johnson's chart work, a break above 2.70 percent might unleash a torrent of selling for U.S. Treasurys.\nFederal Reserve members have expressed a willingness to raise the federal funds rate at least three times this year, moving off of the historically low levels of the financial crisis. Fed funds futures price in the hike in March, the second in June and a possible third in December \u2013 at a presumed steady increase of 25 basis points each time, the fed funds rate would then end the year at 2 percent to 2.25 percent. Bond prices typically fall when rates rise.\nRates around the world have been increasing on signs of a global recovery. Mark Tepper, president and CEO of Strategic Wealth Partners, says rising interest rates are a vote of confidence for the economy and should not meaningfully impact corporations' spending plans.\n\"If anything we would argue that a rising 10-year yield just indicates continued confidence in both the economy and corporate earnings and it should be good for stocks,\" he told CNBC. \"We're a firm believer that tax reform is going to stimulate capex and we don't think rising rates are going to prevent corporations from borrowing so they can fund their infrastructure investments.\"\nAlready, a string of corporations have announced changes resulting from the Republican tax reform bill passed in December. Walmart plans to raise its starting wage and offer paid parental and maternity leave, Wells Fargo upped its base wage, and AT&T and Bank of America announced bonuses for their workers.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

The $10,000 limit, which became effective for the 2018 tax year, will hit many taxpayers in states with high incomes, property values and taxes. \nPaying New York state taxes out of corporate payroll rather than an income tax would help ease the effect on residents of the new cap. New York state residents, however, would still face a $10,000 cap on deductions of local and property taxes. \nAccording to the Cuomo administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the ongoing discussions have not yet been formalized, the chief executives of the largest employers in New York City are willing to consider the move to a payroll tax system. \n\u201cYes, they want to be part of it. They want to be part of how we put it together because their employees are negatively impacted,\u201d the official said, giving greater detail for the first time to plans broadly outlined by Cuomo in his 2018 State of the State address on Wednesday. \n\u201cMake no mistake, they (Washington) are aiming to hurt us,\u201d Cuomo said in his State of the State address. \u201cThis could cause people to leave the state of New York. And it could reduce our ability to attract business.\u201d \nThe high-tax states facing the most pain from the new limits on SALT deductions, including New York, New Jersey and California, are generally Democratic leaning. \nOn Thursday in California a state lawmaker introduced legislation that would allow residents to make donations instead of paying taxes to avoid the cap on deductions of state taxes. \nWhite House economic adviser Gary Cohn said the federal government might try to block attempts to circumvent the cap, Bloomberg reported on Friday. \nHow tax bill ripples through industries: reut.rs\/2yZs782 CHARITY INSTEAD OF TAXES \nCuomo on Wednesday said he will challenge the new law in court as unconstitutional on the grounds that the first federal double taxation in U.S. history violates states\u2019 rights and equal protection. \nThe New York corporations want to be included in the plan to move to a payroll tax, but the administration source declined to name companies, citing instead the Partnership for New York City, which represents business leaders and employers. \nThe partnership on Wednesday said in a statement that its members \u201capplaud\u201d the governor\u2019s commitment to address the loss of state and local tax deductibility. \nMembers of the partnership include American Express, Bank of America and BlackRock. \nFor a tax code restructuring, New York state is also assessing whether to create new opportunities for charitable contributions to support public programs. \nThe senior official said that, per case law, a contribution to a state and local government for a specific purpose is a charitable contribution. \n\u201cSo if you want to contribute to a school, a public school specifically, or a not-for-profit that supports a government purpose... you get a tax deduction,\u201d the official said. \u201cOr the state can create a charity that also gives to hospitals.\u201d \n\u201cYou can create incentives for people to contribute to charities that would replace some government funding,\u201d the official added. \nThe state will also assess how individuals would build in tax preferences in a new system, the official said. \n\u201cBut if you just turn yourself into a corp, limited liability corporation, and pay yourself, then you magically are now able to deduct your state and local taxes. We\u2019re looking at all of these options.\u201d Reporting by Stephanie Kelly; Editing by Daniel Bases and Leslie Adler"}

{"published":"2018-01-01T19:56:00.000+02:00","title":"REFILE-Box Office: 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' Holds Off 'Jumanji' on New Year's Weekend","text":"Year's Weekend@ (Corrects to add dateline)\nLOS ANGELES, Jan 1 ( Variety.com ) - In a battle of box office heavyweights, Luke Skywalker just managed to hold off Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson as the world rang in another year.\nDisney and LucasFilm's \"\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" retained first place for the four-day New Year's holiday weekend despite steep competition from Sony's \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.\" \"Last Jedi\" picked up an estimated $68.4 million, bringing its domestic haul to $533.1 million.\nDon't weep for \"Jumanji,\" however. The fantasy reboot, which finds Johnson, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart transported into a video game world, has outperformed expectations, picking up a lordly $66.5 million over the holiday weekend. It now has a hefty $185.7 million domestic gross and should continue to draw crowds in 2018. The \"Jumanji\" sequel has also done well internationally, racking up $350 million worldwide, and has provided a much-needed hit for a studio that has struggled to keep pace with the Disney's and Warner Bros.'s of the world. Sony claims the film has a $90 million budget. Those alleged production costs have raised eyebrows around town as to their veracity given the film's Hawaii location and starry cast, but regardless of creative accounting and aggressive spinning, the result is impressive. A sequel seems preordained.\n\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" closed 2017 as the year's highest-grossing release and the seventh highest-grossing domestic movie of all time with $517.1 million. It will bypass its fellow franchisee \"Rogue One\" at some point on New Year's Day to take the seventh spot on the stateside charts and has already blown past the $1 billion mark globally. The film carries a $200 million price tag, and has generated controversy for a series of creative decisions by director and writer Rian Johnson that have, depending on your perspective, either infused new energy into decades-old series or deviated dangerously from the Jedi canon.\nIt's been a dismal year for the domestic box office, which ends 2017 with $11.12 billion in sales, down 2.3% from last year's $11.38 billion and off slightly from 2015's $11.14 billion, according to comScore. After a bruising summer, when revenues plummeted more than 6% in the wake of costly flops such as \"The Mummy\" and \"Transformer: The Last Knight,\" the gap did narrow. Fall and winter hits such as \"It,\" \"Thor: Ragnarok,\" \"Coco,\" and \"Murder on the Orient Express,\" helped make up the difference. The industry was also aided by record ticket prices. Empirically, fewer people made it to the multiplexes. Attendance is expected to hit a 27-year low when official numbers are tallied.\nUniversal's \"Pitch Perfect 3\" took third place on the stateside charts, grossing $22.7 million for the four-day period and pushing its domestic total to just under $70 million. The a Cappella comedy carries a $45 million production budget and has been billed as the final installment in the franchise.\nHugh Jackman's musical drama \"The Greatest Showman\" is finishing a close fourth with $20.7 million. The Fox-Chernin Entertainment production chronicles the rise of circus impresario P.T. Barnum. It got a boost from the holidays, and showed the biggest gain in the top 10 movies from the Christmas Eve weekend with an impressive 73% surge. The domestic total should hit $54.3 million through Monday. It's a pricey movie, though. All that singing and dancing didn't come cheap and \"The Greatest Showman\" cost $84 million to make.\nFox's second weekend of \"Ferdinand\" rounded out the top five with $14.6 million, giving the animated comedy $56.8 million domestically.\nNot every film was feeling the holiday spirit. Paramount's \"Downsizing\" is a costly bomb. The comedy about a man (Matt Damon) who shrinks to the size of thimble in order to live in a materialistic utopia collapsed at the box office, eking out $6.1 million over the long weekend. Its total stands at $18.5 million -- a paltry result given its $65 million budget. It also prolongs a box office losing streak for Damon. The actor also struck out with \"Suburbicon\" and \"The Great Wall,\" both of which opened during and flopped in 2017.\nWarner Bros. and Alcon's comedy \"Father Figures\" was another casualty of the Christmas crunch. The story of two twin brothers (Ed Helms and Owen Wilson) on a quest to find their biological father netted $5.1 million over the four-day weekend. Its total tops out at $14.1 million, making it unlikely that it will recoup its $25 million production budget as well its marketing costs.\nAnd Sony's \"All the Money in the World\" struggled to appeal to older audiences. The drama about the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III attracted lots of attention for the filmmakers' last minute decision to re-cast a key role played by disgraced actor Kevin Spacey. The breakneck reshoots took place in a matter of weeks, with Christopher Plummer assuming the Spacey part as parsimonious billionaire J. Paul Getty, and added $10 million to the film's $40 million budget. Alas, audiences failed to show up. The movie grossed $7.5 million over the holiday weekend, bringing its domestic total to $14.7 million.\nForeign audiences picked up the slack as domestic attendance sputtered in 2017. The global box office is projected to hit $40 billion for the first time in history, propelled by the return of China. Total ticket sales in the Middle Kingdom grew by 22.3%, ending the year with $8.6 billion in revenues. That, at least, gives a beleaguered movie business some cause for celebration."}

(NASDAQ: NUVA), the leader in spine technology innovation, focused on transforming spine surgery with minimally disruptive, procedurally-integrated solutions, today announced preliminary unaudited revenue results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. The Company expects fourth quarter 2017 revenue to be approximately $272 million and full year 2017 revenue to be approximately $1,030 million and in line with the guidance provided on Oct 24, 2017.\nNuVasive preliminary revenue results for full year 2017 reflect approximately 7% growth on a reported and constant currency basis, compared to revenue of $962 million for 2016. When NuVasive updated its full year 2017 financial guidance on Oct. 24 to reflect third-quarter 2017 results, the Company assumed international revenue growth of over 20 percent, a lingering impact of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in the fourth quarter and softer U.S. procedural volumes continuing into the fourth quarter. Those assumptions have remained unchanged.\nThe Company will report full year 2017 financial results and provide its full financial outlook for 2018 during its earnings announcement planned for mid-February.\n\"NuVasive launched a record number of new technologies in 2017 and accelerated growth across the globe delivering more than a 20 percent sales increase outside the United States for the fifth sequential quarter,\" said Gregory T. Lucier, chairman and chief executive officer of NuVasive. \"What's impressive is this success has occurred in a year when the overall U.S. spine market has softened. Whether through game-changing product introductions or strategic acquisitions, we intend to deliver the most innovative and comprehensive spine solutions to our customers so they can best serve their patients. We will continue this momentum in 2018.\"\n2018 Preliminary Outlook\nThe Company's preliminary outlook for 2018 includes full year revenue growth in the mid-single digits over 2017 revenue results, at least 100 basis points of expansion in non-GAAP operating margin, adjusted EBITDA now in a range of approximately $290 to $300 million, and a substantial tax savings resulting from the tax reform legislation passed late in 2017.\nWhen the Company provides its full financial outlook for 2018, it will include the expected financial impact of the Company's acquisition of SafePassage. In Dec. 2017, NuVasive announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire SafePassage to bolster its NuVasive Clinical Services\u2122 business and solidify its leadership position as the largest provider of outsourced intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) services. This joining of forces will strengthen the NuVasive IONM business line with more than 550 neurophysiologists and oversight physicians in the U.S.\u2014allowing for the delivery of services to over 1,000 customers and 3,000 surgeons. The acquisition of SafePassage remains on track and is anticipated to close in Jan. 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe Company will also provide additional commentary on the expected impact of U.S. tax reform. NuVasive expects to realize substantial tax savings as a result of the recent passage of the tax bill, An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, which provides for a reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to approximately 21 percent. The legislation is poised to significantly reduce the future corporate tax rate for NuVasive, which prior to the enactment of the tax overhaul was expected to be approximately 33 percent on a non-GAAP basis in 2018.\nAbout NuVasive\nNuVasive, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUVA) is the leader in spine technology innovation, focused on transforming spine surgery and beyond with minimally disruptive, procedurally-integrated solutions designed to deliver reproducible and clinically-proven surgical outcomes. The Company's portfolio includes access instruments, implantable hardware, biologics, software systems for surgical planning, navigation and imaging solutions, magnetically adjustable implant systems for spine and orthopedics, and intraoperative monitoring service offerings. With $962 million in revenues (2016), NuVasive has an approximate 2,300 person workforce in more than 40 countries serving surgeons, hospitals and patients.

They include: Waddington, Process Solutions, Rubbermaid Commercial Products, Rawlings, Goody, Rubbermaid Outdoor and U.S. Playing Cards. \nIf Newell moves forward with all of its restructuring plans, the company's global factory and warehouse footprint would see a reduction of 50 percent. \nThe company plans to refocus on nine core consumer businesses, which generate $11 billion in total net sales, roughly 82 percent of Newell's fiscal 2016 sales. \nThe moves come a little over a year after its $13.22 billion acquisition of Jarden Corp. in a combination of two consumer giants with vast portfolios. Investors at the time questioned how difficult it would be to integrate a collection of brands spanning Elmer's Glue, Sharpie Pens and Yankee Candle. Several of the brands Newell is selling came from the Jarden acquisition. \n\"It's a big and broad portfolio, the work will not be easy, but it will come together through great leadership,\" Newell Brands CEO Michael Polk told CNBC after the deal closed. \nNewell's stock was down nearly 22 percent by midday Thursday. Newell shares have lost more than 32 percent in the new year through Wednesday's close. In recent months, consumer products giants have seen escalating pressure from retailers, who are working hard to keep prices low to attract shoppers and manage their inventory. Martin Franklin announced his resignation Thursday from the board, as did Ian G.H. Ashken and Domenico De Sole. The three had joined Newell's board as part of the acquisition. \n\"While there is still much work to be done, Domenico, Martin, and Ian have helped management and the Board bring these two great companies together into one of the leading branded goods companies,\" the company said in a statement. \nFranklin is an investor known for his acquisition vehicles like Jarden and frozen food-focused Nomad Foods. He left the board because he felt limited in his ability to influence the company's strategy going forward, sources familiar with the situation said. \nThose sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information is not public. Franklin could not be reached for comment and Newell declined to comment. \nPart of the company's strategy, as outlined in 2016, has been a focus on driving growth through innovation.

Young and Jan Harvey NEW YORK\/LONDON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Wednesday, hitting its highest in nearly four months as the dollar swooned after a report that Chinese officials had recommended slowing or halting purchases of U.S. Treasury securities. The dollar, already under pressure versus the Japanese yen after the Bank of Japan moved to trim its long-dated government bond purchases this week, was on track to post its biggest single-day drop against the yen in seven weeks. The greenback also lost ground against a basket of major currencies. Spot gold was up 0.5 percent at $1,318.67 an ounce by 1:41 p.m. EST (1841 GMT). Its session high of $1,326.56 was its highest since Sept. 15. U.S. gold futures for February delivery settled up $5.60, or 0.4 percent, at $1,319.30 per ounce. U.S. Treasury yields jumped to 10-month highs after Bloomberg News reported that Chinese officials have recommended the country slow or halt its purchases of the U.S. bonds. Rising Treasury yields can pressure prices for gold, but the dollar's slide helped gold shrug off the impact. The report \"added pressure on the U.S. dollar and helped gold,\" said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto. \"Gold did better, despite the fact that the yields across the curve moved higher,\" he said. \"With bond yields going up so steadily and looking like they\u2019re going higher that could be a bit of a headwind given the fact that gold is a non interest-bearing asset,\" said Bill O\u2019Neill, partner, co-founder of LOGIC Advisors in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. A possible slow-down or halt to China purchasing U.S. Treasury yields could have significant repercussions, ONADA said in a note. \"The tightening effect of such measures would likely have an impact on how many times the Federal Reserve raises interest rates this year, which is why we've seen a corresponding drop in the dollar,\" OANDA said. Among other metals, palladium dropped 1.5 percent at $1,083.97 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Tuesday at $1,111.40. Tightening emissions standards and a switch away from diesel cars to more palladium-heavy gasoline models has shored up demand expectations for the autocatalyst metal. Platinum was up 0.9 percent at $973.60 an ounce, after hitting a nearly four-month high of $973.90. Silver was up 0.4 percent at $17.01 an ounce, after earlier drifting to $16.86, its lowest since Dec. 29.

About a third of those will be in the state of Mato Grosso, where recently grain growers have relied more on the barter system to finance their crop. \nUnder barter, multinational commodities trading firms and agriculture product resellers supply inputs to farmers in exchange for securing future delivery of a portion of their crops. \nFor the first time since the 2008\/2009 crop season, barter represented more than half of crop financing for producers in the state, according to Imea, a research agency based in Brazil's largest grain producing state. \n\"Barter is only used in Brazil,\" Aguiar said, adding the bank can offer loan options potentially more competitive to producers. \nState-run Banco do Brasil SA remains Brazil's largest rural credit provider, with about 66 percent of farm loans totaling 188 billion reais as of last October, according a ranking compiled by bank association Febraban.

Young and Maytaal Angel NEW YORK\/LONDON, Jan 4, (Reuters) - Gold steadied around a 3-1\/2-month high on Thursday as prospects for further U.S. interest rate increases put the brakes on a recent rally, while palladium touched record highs on tight supplies. Spot gold rose 0.5 percent to $1,319.27 an ounce by 1:45 p.m. EST (1845 GMT), while U.S. gold futures for February delivery settled up $3.10, or 0.24 percent, at $1,321.6 per ounce. Palladium rose 1.2 percent to $1,095.24 an ounce, earlier hitting a record high of $1,105.70. The U.S. dollar hit a four-month low against the euro amid optimism about the euro zone economy. However, gold, which tends to move counter to the U.S. currency, was unable to capitalize on the dollar weakness and hovered just below its 3-1\/2-month high hit yesterday. \"(Gold) is beginning to look overvalued. Our fair value for gold assuming a (U.S.) rate hike in March and June is around $1,230, so at current prices it looks expensive,\" said James Butterfill, head of research at ETF Securities. Still, after digesting the U.S. Federal Reserve's minutes from its December policy meeting released on Wednesday, market participants have begun to doubt the sentiment that recent U.S. tax changes will lead to inflation, and the widely-expected path of future rate hikes, analysts said. \"They're starting to doubt that the Fed will hike rates as much as they said they will. That provides a more attractive environment for gold,\" said Daniel Ghali, commodities strategist at TD Securities in Toronto. Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates because they increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced. Gold also benefited from safe-haven purchases. \"That's why we think its likely to continue to trade between $1,200 and $1,300 over the next six months,\" Butterfill said. Spot gold marked its highest since Sept. 15 at $1,321.33 on Wednesday but eased as the dollar recovered after minutes from the Fed's December policy meeting had initially bolstered expectations for more increases to U.S. interest rates. Palladium's price jumped 56 percent last year on fears of a shortage fueled by Chinese car sales growth, tightening emissions controls and a swing away from diesel cars in Europe. \"We see palladium prices remaining well supported, although there is a danger from here of a short-term pullback as investors take profits,\" Mitsubishi said in a note. Silver rose 0.3 percent at $17.18 per ounce after earlier hitting a eight-week high at $17.26. Platinum rose 0.7 percent to $963 an ounce after earlier touching a 3-1\/2 month high of $964.80.

In a Wednesday note to clients he wrote that TJX (owner of TJ Maxx, HomeGoods and Marshalls), Ross Stores and Burlington could see lower sales in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2018.\nWells Fargo downgraded shares of TJX to market perform and cut its price target to $72 from $76. The stock closed Tuesday at $76.69, having climbed a little more than 7 percent over the past six months. TJX shares were falling around 2 percent late Wednesday morning.\nWells Fargo's price targets for Ross and Burlington were left unchanged, but both stocks were also trading modestly lower Wednesday.\nBoruchow explained that talks with other brands are fueling his expectations that there could be a slowdown in the off-price sector's momentum in the coming months.\n\"The issue for TJX, relative to ROST and BURL, is size (they are multiples larger and carry many more brands),\" he wrote. However, the \"off-price setup from here could become 'less good' relative to the past 2 years.\"\nOther industry consultants have chimed in, saying it's true these companies could be bracing for some deceleration.\n\"I do think [off-price retailers] lose a little steam as they will generally have some of the most difficult comparisons going of any retail segment in 2018,\" Retail Metrics founder Ken Perkins told CNBC.\nThen, some shoppers might \"trade up\" to new stores as the economy improves, he added, but the impact there should only be \"marginal.\"\nOthers are still cheering on the stocks, though, and think TJX in particular could continue to gain market share as department stores shutter lcoations. Cowen and Co. analyst Oliver Chen is calling the company his \"best idea for 2018,\" based on the fact that customers still appreciate TJX's \"deep value.\"\n\"As most of traditional retail contracts their store bases and right-sizes their organizations to better fit the new normal of lower revenue bases, TJX sees significant white space ahead in terms of store growth,\" Chen wrote.\nGrowing at such a rapid clip (and recently launching a new brand, Homesense) could be a smart move for TJX, where others are cutting back, but some remain wary the expansion could come back to haunt the company."}

Hunt has the right to take an assignment of the MGM Agreement which, if exercised, will result in Hunt also acquiring the MGM LIHTC business. In conjunction with the sale transaction, the Company also engaged Hunt to perform the day-to-day operations of the Company, including investment, management and financial reporting services. Hunt agreed to pay the Company $57 million in the form of a seven-year note as described below and to assume certain liabilities of the Company as consideration for this sale transaction. The Company may receive additional purchase consideration based on the performance of the transferred LIHTC business. The Company provided financing for the purchase price in the form of a seven-year, fully amortizing note receivable from Hunt that bears a stated rate of interest of 5%, is payable quarterly and is secured by certain ownership interests in subsidiaries of Hunt. The Company will recognize an estimated increase in shareholders' equity of $32 million upon settlement of this sale transaction and will recognize an estimated $9 million increase in common shareholders' equity in the first quarter of 2018 in connection with the adoption of new revenue recognition rules whose transitional effect is primarily driven by contracts associated with the Company's conveyed LIHTC business line. Additionally, should Hunt take an assignment of the MGM Agreement and, subject to the terms of the MGM Agreement, consummate the acquisition of the MGM LIHTC business, the Company estimates that it would recognize an incremental increase in common shareholders' equity of $14 million.\nMichael Falcone, MMA Capital's Chief Executive Officer stated, \"For some time we have heard from shareholders that our business is too small and too complicated to understand. With this transaction we have started a process to change that. When all elements of this transaction are complete, we will have achieved significant value realization from our tax credit and international businesses, simplified our balance sheet, reduced our overhead, and increased transparency, while preserving our net operating losses and our attractively priced long-term subordinate debt. Going forward we will continue to invest primarily in debt related to affordable housing and clean energy. Our hope is that our increased transparency and the simplification of our balance sheet will help our shareholders to better understand our value as we work to grow the business over time, including through increased investment supported by retained earnings and accretive share issuance.\"\nIn order to ensure alignment of interests between the Company and Hunt, Hunt has agreed to buy 250,000 of the Company's common shares in two equal tranches. An initial 125,000 shares must be acquired by March 8, 2018 at a price of $33.00 per share, and the balance by July 8, 2018 at a price of $34.00 per share, resulting in an aggregate capital raise of $8,375,000, or $33.50 per share. In connection with Hunt's investment, the Company agreed to appoint an individual selected by Hunt as a non-voting observer to our Board effective immediately and agreed to appoint an individual selected by Hunt as a Class II director of the Board upon completion of the share acquisition. Hunt selected and the Board appointed James C. (\"Chris\") Hunt as Hunt's non-voting observer to the Board.\nMr. Falcone, Mr. Bjarnason and Mr. Mentesana have all signed amendments to their employment agreements that will have them continue to serve in their current roles subsequent to the closing of the transaction. They have agreed to buy additional shares as part of their 2017 bonus program, as well as to accept additional restrictions related to the shares they currently own. In addition, all current employees of the Company and its subsidiaries will become employees of Hunt.\nMr. Falcone continued, \"We are excited by this transaction and what it means for our shareholders and the future of the Company. First, the sale of the management businesses allows us to immediately monetize businesses that would have taken us quite a while to properly develop, while taking back an income producing note receivable that provides a consistent earnings stream over the next seven years as we advance our future business model. Second, selling operating businesses and externalizing the management of the Company will result in immediate savings on the overhead burden currently borne by the Company, helping right-size the costs associated with operating a public company of our size. Third, we have partnered with an outstanding organization in Hunt, which is expected to bring even greater breadth of origination capacity and investing experience to the management of the Company. Finally, our Board of Directors looks forward to Chris Hunt's insights and perspectives as a contributor to our Board. Chris brings a tremendous amount of real estate investment and operations knowledge and will help the transition to our new business model.\"\nChris Hunt, Chief Executive Officer of Hunt stated, \"I look forward to working with the Board to help build value for all shareholders. The complimentary nature of our businesses with MMA Capital made this deal very attractive for Hunt. We at Hunt see significant value in the Company's shares as evidenced by our acquisition of shares related to the closing of this transaction. It's my belief that this share purchase aligns the interests of Hunt as external manager with those of the shareholders of MMA Capital as we seek to grow the Company in the coming years.\"\nFrancis X. Gallagher, Chairman of the Board for the Company, stated, \"This is a tremendous opportunity for the Company to work with a well-matched partner and forge ahead with the growth and investment opportunities that will further enhance shareholder value. For us, it was important to see shareholders rewarded by the recognition of value related to the disposed businesses, as well as to see Hunt's commitment to the continued growth of the Company, the continuity of our employees and the vision for our investment path moving forward.\"\nMr. Falcone continued, \"While we generated a significant gain with this transaction today, we likely will realize fewer one-time gains in future periods than we have in the past due to the disposition of the LIHTC business. We believe that this tra"}

Central to the plot is the boy\u2019s trusty Paracho-style guitar. \nThe 16th century-style guitars have been a way of life in the town of 30,000 for centuries. According to legend, a priest with the original Spanish conquerors decided locals in the village should be taught a craft to support their economy. \nParacho soon gained fame as Mexico\u2019s capital for the manufacture of stringed instruments, and \u201cCoco\u201d has now brought its craftsmen global fame and booming sales, artisans said. \nThe film, released by Walt Disney Co\u2019s Pixar, has grossed more than $550 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo. It ranks as the highest grossing movie in Mexico ever. \nCosts for the hand-made guitars range from around 2,000 Mexican pesos ($104 dollars) to those made with fine wood that fetch up to 20,000 pesos ($1,042 dollars). \nDue to popular request, local artisans have given the traditionally black guitar a Day-Of-The-Dead twist by painting the instrument white and adding a cartoon of the traditional Mexican skull on its front.

A general view of the Canary Wharf financial district in London, Britain October 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Kevin Coombs \nThe fees they charged companies and other financial firms for advising on mergers and acquisitions, arranging loans, and underwriting sales of bonds and stocks reached $104 billion, according to Reuters data. \nThat was up 16 percent on the previous year and the highest annual total for investment banking fees since Reuters started tracking the data in 2000. \nThis is noteworthy in itself, but especially so in light of what\u2019s happening to investment banks\u2019 primary source of revenue: trading. \nRapid technological change, automated trading, tighter regulation that limits banks\u2019 capacity to hold fixed income inventory on their books, and record low market volatility have conspired to reduce trading revenue in recent years. \nAccording to industry data provider Coalition, the top 12 investment banks pulled in $119 billion from bond, currency, commodities and equity trading in 2016, the last full year for which figures are available. That\u2019s down nearly 15 percent from $140 billion in 2012. \nTrading accounted for revenues of $61.1 billion in the first half of 2017, Coalition figures show. As the bulk of trading activity is conducted in the first six months of any year, it looks like the 2017 total will be the lowest in years. \nMost of the decline is in fixed income, currency and commodities -- or FICC -- trading, where regulation has been tightened most and where banks have pulled back most. Equity trading is holding up better but remains a far smaller share of banks\u2019 trading pie than FICC. \nThe new year is only a few days old but there is no sign of a pick-up in market volatility, a prerequisite for a rebound in trading activity and revenue. \nThe VIX index of implied volatility on Wall Street has traded below 9 percent on only seven days since its launch nearly 30 years ago. Six have been in the last six months, and two of them have been this week. \nEven though the Fed is raising U.S. interest rates and other central banks are gradually turning off the stimulus taps, currency and bond market volatility remains anchored near historic lows too. $104 BILLION BONANZA \nIn a world of weak trading, equity capital market (ECM) and debt capital market (DCM) activity is commanding a greater share of big banks\u2019 revenues and profits with every passing year. \nA bumper 2017 was always likely given that last year saw a high number and value of deals across equity and debt markets, the lowest stock and bond volatility on record, and dozens of new highs for global stock markets. \nEven still, it was a remarkable year for fees. The record $104 billion was comprised of $28.1 billion from M&A advisory services, $31.3 bln from DCM activity, $22.4 bln from ECM underwriting and $22.2 bln from syndicating loans. \nECM fees leapt 42 percent to a three-year high of $22.4 billion. As a share of overall ECM activity that was 2.9 percent, according to Reuters calculations -- the highest in at least a decade and well up from 2.1 percent in 2016. \nThe surge in ECM fees far outstripped the rise in ECM activity and transaction value. \nCompanies raised $783.7 billion in equity during 2017, up 18 percent from the previous year and the strongest annual period for global ECM issuance in two years. The 5,735 ECM offerings during the year marked a rise of 21 percent over 2016 and was the strongest full-year period since records began in 1980, the Reuters data showed. \nDCM fees rose 15 percent to a new record $31.3 billion. Always tiny compared to overall DCM transactions, they rose to 0.4 percent of the value of transactions from 0.3 percent in 2016, according to Reuters calculations. \nAgain, the rise in fees wasn\u2019t matched by changes in the value or number of transactions. The number of debt issues globally rose 11 percent to 23,321, a new record for a calendar year while DCM activity actually slipped to $7.2 trillion, although that was the second consecutive year above $7 trillion. \nThe opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

As a result of a six-month analysis of the company's current operations and future needs of its customers, the decision comes in the wake of the neighborhood in transition from manufacturing and warehousing, to retail and upscale residential apartments, higher operating costs, and the lack of efficiencies operating out of multiple buildings.\n\"Business decisions that directly impact our employees are extremely difficult,\" said Andrew Schuman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hammond's Brands. \"Old Dominion has operated in Norfolk for over 100 years and we have employees that have been with us for nearly 40 years. The plant closure does not reflect the end of the Old Dominion Peanut Company, rather it marks the beginning of the next chapter of our business operations for long-term health.\"\nThe closing is expected to be completed by early summer of this year. Hammond's Brands, owner of Old Dominion Peanut Company will relocate part of the ODP operations to its headquarters in Denver, Colorado and certain production of its products will be transferred to a third party under a long-term co-manufacturing agreement.\n\"This is a company restructuring initiative that will allow the company to intensify product scope and drive future profitability to our core businesses. Our response to this unfortunate solution is that we must combine a commitment to long-term investments in innovation and manufacturing. We believe this closure is crucial to our ability to increase efficiency and reduce the company's cost structure. Today's news will allow us to accelerate our growth strategy and drive long-term change, all to further Hammond's success,\" said Schuman.\nThe Norfolk facility currently employs approximately 70 wage and salaried employees and produces products such as peanut brittles, nut candies, and chocolate covered nuts. Recognizing that the ODP facility has been a significant part of the local economy in Norfolk, Hammond's is enlisting the aid of the Virginia Employment Commission and communities to allow workers the maximum access to public services and ensure a seamless transition for our employees.\nSchuman added, \"I am overwhelmingly appreciative of the contributions each of our employees have made to our company, and am sorry we have not been able to find a solution that would allow us to continue operations in Norfolk. Norfolk remains a wonderful place to do business and we have greatly respected the many services over the years provided by the city. We wish nothing but the best for the Norfolk and Hampton Roads communities.\"\nAbout Hammond's\nHammond's Candies began delighting candy lovers with artisan candy canes, beautifully spun ribbon candy, and larger-than-life lollipops when it was founded by the Hammond family in 1920, making it Colorado's favorite handmade confectioner for decades. In 2007, the company became the Hammond's that it is today through its acquisition by current President and CEO Andrew Schuman, growing from a much-loved, local candy company to a leading gourmet sweet provider with national regard.

The distribution is subject to the following ex-dividend, record and payment dates set by the Fund's Board of Trustees.\nJanuary 2018\nDeclaration\nTuesday, January 2, 2018\nEx-Dividend\nWednesday, January 17, 2018\nRecord\nThursday, January 18, 2018\nPayment\nWednesday, January 31, 2018\nThis press release is not for tax reporting purposes. The press release has been issued to announce the amount and timing of the distributions declared by the Board of Trustees. There is a possibility that distributions may include ordinary income, long-term capital gains or return of capital. For information on whether the distribution includes a return of capital, please contact us on or after the distribution payment date. The amount of distributable income and the tax characteristics of the distributions are determined at the end of the taxable year. In early 2019, the Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV specifying how the distributions paid by the Fund during the prior calendar year should be characterized for purposes of reporting the distributions on a shareholder's tax return.\nAbout DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund\nThe Fund's primary investment objective is to seek high current income; its secondary objective is to seek capital appreciation. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a portfolio of investments selected for their potential to provide high current income, growth of capital, or both. DoubleLine Capital LP (\"DoubleLine\"), the Fund's investment adviser, expects that the Fund will normally invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in debt securities and other income-producing investments anywhere in the world, including emerging markets. The Fund may invest in mortgage-backed securities of any kind and may invest without limit in securities rated below investment grade (commonly referred to as \"high yield\" securities or \"junk bonds\"). There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in the Fund involves the risk of principal loss.\nAbout DoubleLine Capital LP\nDoubleLine Capital LP, a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, acts as the investment adviser for the Fund. DoubleLine's offices in Los Angeles can be reached by telephone at (213) 633-8200 or by e-mail at info@doubleline.com . Media can reach DoubleLine by e-mail at media@doubleline.com .

Investors should consider the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. An investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program. Investors should note that the Fund only can be obtained through a broker.\nThere is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives.\nInvestments in this closed-end fund involves fees and expenses. Please refer to the prospectus for more information.\nThis document is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, nor shall there be any sale or offer of these securities, in any jurisdiction where such sale or offer is not permitted.\nFund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.\nShares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value, which may increase investors' risk of loss. This risk may be greater for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after the completion of the public offering. There are risks associated with investment in the fund.\nInvestments in debt securities typically decline in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of including credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. The Fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. Investments in lower rated and non-rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. Debt securities of below investment grade quality are regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to capacity to pay interest and to repay principal, and are commonly referred to as \"high yield\" securities or \"junk bonds.\" There is no assurance the Fund's leveraging strategies will be successful. Leverage is a speculative technique that may expose the Fund to greater risk and increased cost. The value of the Fund's investments in REITs may change in response to changes in the real estate market such as declines in the value of real estate, lack of available capital or financing opportunities, and increase in property taxes or operating costs. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. The Fund may make short sales of securities, which involve the risk that losses may exceed the original amount invested. The Fund may invest in small companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Fund is a \"non-diversified\" investment company and therefore may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a limited number of issuers than funds that are \"diversified.\" Accordingly, the Fund is more susceptible to risks associated with a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund might be.\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.\nPast distribution history is not a projection of potential future distributions. Distributions include all distribution payments regardless of source and may include net income, capital gains, and\/or return of capital. Information regarding the source of distributions other than net income may be found by calling 1 (877) 354-6311\/1 (877) DLINE11.\nThis material may include statements that constitute \"forward-looking statements\" under the U.S. securities laws. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, projections, estimates, and information about possible or future results related to the Fund, market or regulatory developments.

PNC is also reporting earnings Friday after the bell, with options traders expecting an implied move of 3 percent for the name.\nFrom a technical standpoint, Carter Worth, chief market technician at Cornerstone Macro, sees trouble ahead in the space. The financials-tracking ETF ( XLF ) is up almost 2 percent since the start of the year and closed at its highest level since October 2007 on Friday. But Worth says it hasn't been the banks that have driven XLF to multiyear highs despite rallies in names like Bank of America and Wells Fargo, both up 2 percent since the start of 2018.\n\"But what's interesting is [XLF is] so dependent on names like American Express and big insurance companies like Travelers,\" he said Friday on CNBC's \"Options Action.\" \"The banks themselves have trailed the market, and regional banks have really trailed.\"\nTo illustrate his point, Worth brought up a chart of the KBW Bank Index , which includes both big banks and smaller regional names. While the index has rallied about 2 percent in the past month, Worth points out that the index is actually underperforming the S&P 500.\nIn fact, since the start of the year the KBW index has rallied almost 2 percent while the S&P has rallied about 3 percent.\nThe same can be said for big bank J.P. Morgan. The company's stock has made an impressive 10 percent comeback since the end of November. The rally was first fueled by the Nov. 28 hearing for Fed Chairman nominee Jerome Powell , where he said that bank rules were \"tough enough\" for a stable financial system, and then with the passage of the tax law and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates in December.\nBut despite the slew of good news for banks, Worth points out that J.P.

The state's move is designed to get more people insured who now are put off by Obamacare prices. \nIdaho says it will allow insurers to be able to issue separate plans that charge older customers much more than they currently can in Obamacare plans, and permit insurers to charge people higher premiums if they have health problems \u2014 which is barred by Obamacare. The state would also allow insurers to set a $1 million cap on what they have to pay out in health costs for customers, which also is now barred by Obamacare. \nAnd the new plans would be allowed to cover fewer benefits that are currently mandated by the Affordable Care Act. \n\"It's wildly illegal,\" said Sam Berger, senior adviser at the liberal Center for American Progress, and a former health-care advisor in the White House during the Obama administration. \"There's no argument that anyone's put forward that it's not illegal.\" \nHe said insurers that issue the new plans could be fined $100 per customer, per day, by federal regulators for violating the Affordable Care Act's standards . That works out to $365,000 in potential fines per customer every year \u2014 putting insurers at risk of insolvency. \nOfficials at the U.S. Health and Human Services Department have not responded to CNBC's request for comment about Idaho's move. That silence is raising the question of whether the Trump administration will end up tolerating Idaho's policy because of the Trump White House's hostility toward Obamacare. \nBerger said the situation is a crucial test for HHS's new secretary, Alex Azar, a Yale Law school grad, who is being confronted by a state which is suggesting that insurers can flout federal law. \n\"Is Azar willing to basically violate centuries of American law in his first few days while he throws aside everything that he and every other lawyer has been taught and is willing to do it for the purpose of harming some of the most vulnerable people in our country, people with pre-existing [health] conditions?\" Berger asked. \nIdaho's Insurance Department on Wednesday issued its bulletin detailing the rules for the new plans. \nWeston Trexler, bureau chief at the Insurance Department, said that \"the biggest driver\" for the move is the fact that \"there's a lot of Idahoans that aren't able to afford the price of health insurance\" sold in the Obamacare market if they do not qualify for federal subsidies. \nTrexler noted that the average, non-subsidized prices of \"silver plans\" sold on Idaho's Obamacare exchange increased by 39 percent this year, and by 24 percent and 23 percent in the prior two years, respectively. Most Obamacare customers buy silver plans, which cover about 70 percent of their health costs. \nTrexler said that only insurers who offer plans on Obamacare marketplaces would be allowed to issue the new plans. \n\"These plans are just an alternative for people being priced out of the market,\" Trexler said. \n\"They're not taking away ACA protections from anyone,\" he said, noting that Obamacare plans will still be available in the state, and that low- and moderate-income customers who buy coverage on Idaho's state-run marketplace will still get subsidies that reduce their premiums. \nThe new plans would likely be less expensive for some customers than current individual market coverage because they would be less comprehensive in terms of benefits, and because insurers would be able to limit their costs through other mechanisms. \nHowever, no customers in the new plans would be eligible for federal subsidies that could reduce their premium costs, and out-of-pocket health costs. \nAnd whereas the ACA bars health plans from charging older customers more than three times the premiums charged younger customers, the new plans allow older people to be charged five times as much. \nAnd while Obamacare bars insurers from medically underwriting, or charging sicker customers higher rates than healthy customers, Idaho would allow insurers to charge sicker customers who enroll in the new plans up to three times the amount charged the healthy. \nAs a result of those two multiplying effects, \"The older, sicker person could be charged 15 times the youngest, healthiest person could be charged,\" said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading health policy research group. \nIf, for example, insurers charged a healthy 21-year-old $100 per month in premiums, a healthy 60-year-old customer could pay a premium of $500 a month, solely due to their age. Now, if that 60-year-old also suffered from terminal cancer, that could increase their premiums up to $1,500 each month. \n\"It's a lot,\" Pollitz said. \"And it's illegal under federal law, so it's not clear to me how this is going to proceed.\" \n\"Some things a state can apply for a waiver for. But this is not that,\" she said. \nBecause of the big price discrepancy allowed by Idaho's directive, it's likely the new plans would tend to draw healthier, younger customers more than older, less-healthy people. \nThe Insurance Department said that insurers would be grouping their Obamacare customers and ones in the new plans as a single risk pool, whose premiums would be used to offset the costs of benefits paid out. \nPollitz said she did not understand how that would work. \n\"You can't have a single risk pool with two rating\" systems, she said, referring to the way the separate plans would set their respective premiums. \nBerger of CAP said that even if HHS does not take action against the new plans, insurers will have a significant legal liability from their own customers if they issue such coverage. He said that a customer who was denied coverage for more than $1 million in health costs by an insurer could then sue the insurer in court for violating ACA rules. \nAn argument by the insurer stipulating that the plan's contract set a cap of $1 million would fail in court, Berger said, because such a contract is illegal under the ACA, and hence be unenforceable. \n\"They will sue, and they will win,\" he said of plan customers. \"Why would it ever make economic sense for [insurers] to enter into illegal and unenforceable contracts?\" Insurers weigh in \nCNBC reached out for comment to all current insurers in the state that issue Obamacare plans in Idaho and asked whether they would issue new plans alongside their ACA-compliant plans in light of the state's new directive. Three of the five insurers explicitly mentioned legal concerns about the directive. Ken Provencher, CEO of PacificSource Health Plans, said in an emailed statement: \"We are still evaluating the implications of this decision.\" He added:\"Before we decide next steps, it's important to us that we assess the impact this might have on the ACA pool, the potential market disruption and overall legality. ... We are actively discussing these issues and will determine our direction soon.\" A representative for SelectHealth said: \"While we remain committed to offering plans that are attractive and affordable for our members, it is important that any new plan designs allowed in the Individual market do not create regulatory or legal liability for carriers or unnecessary instability in the market.\" The rep added: \"We continue to work closely with regulators to assure that our plans comply with all state and federal laws and regulations. ... SelectHealth intends to continue to offer ACA-compliant Individual plans, in addition to other low-cost short-term plans, and we encourage people to continue to stay insured.\" Regence BlueShield of Idaho, in its own statement, said: \"We are still evaluating the recently released rules, and weighing how to best move forward.\" The company added: \"The Affordable Care Act is still valid law, and we do not see how these rules fit within that framework. ... To comply with current law, we believe it is critical to secure a 1332 waiver [from HHS], and we continue to advocate for a transparent rule-making process in support of providing consumers choice while stabilizing the individual market.\" Charlene Maher, president and CEO of Blue Cross of Idaho, said: \"While we are currently reviewing the guidance, we believe the direction will provide uninsured middle-class families in Idaho with choices in health insurance at a price that fits their budget and meets their needs.\" A fifth insurer, BridgeSpan, had no immediate comment."}

Encouragingly, business was up at its namesake and Bloomingdale\u2019s chains and their related discount business, as well as high end Bluemercury beauty shops, during the most important time of year for any department store. \nMacy\u2019s CEO Jeff Gennette credited the retailer\u2019s new loyalty program, its online sales and the popularity of exclusive gift items for the improvements.

Many analysts were unimpressed with the 1% increase considering Macy\u2019s dismal 2016 season which would make comparisons easier to beat, as well as the overall strong holiday season for retailers at large: retail sales in the U.S. rose 4.9% between Nov. 1 and December 24, their best result since, 2011, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.

FILE PHOTO - City workers are seen at their offices in the financial district of the City of London, Britain, January 7, 2016. REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo \nProductivity in Britain has stagnated since the global financial crisis even more than in most other advanced economies, and has played a key role in squeezing Britons\u2019 living standards. \nOver the past 10 years productivity growth was the weakest since modern records began and appears to be the slowest since the early 1820s, when Britain was emerging from the Napoleonic wars, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday. \nDuring the third quarter of 2017, output per hour worked grew by 0.9 percent compared with the three months before, its first rise since late 2016 and the biggest increase since the second quarter of 2011, the ONS said. \nHowever, the upturn reflected a fall in the number of people in work over the period rather than strong economic growth, which was a lacklustre 0.4 percent. \nBritain\u2019s economy slowed last year, despite strong global growth, as the plunge in the pound that followed its 2016 vote to leave the European Union triggered higher inflation that hurt consumer spending. \nThe uncertainty generated by Brexit has also weighed on businesses\u2019 willingness to invest. UNCERTAIN OUTLOOK \nProductivity dropped in the first half of 2017 as businesses hired staff faster than they increased output. Compared with a year before, third-quarter productivity was just 0.8 percent higher, less than half its pre-crisis growth rate. \nLate last year Britain\u2019s government forecasters revised down their long-run productivity forecasts to around 1 percent a year, after previous expectations for it to pick up to nearer 2 percent were repeatedly disappointed. \nA weaker productivity outlook also drove the BoE\u2019s decision in November to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, as it judged the economy would struggle to grow much faster than 1.5 percent a year without creating excessive inflation. \nThat said, Friday\u2019s data showed unit labour costs - a measure of how much it costs to produce a given amount of output, and a key driver of inflation - rose by the least since the second quarter of 2015, increasing 1.3 percent. \nHoward Archer, an economist at forecasters EY ITEM Club, said productivity was likely to have recovered further in the final three months of 2017. Early indications suggest growth remained solid while the number of people in work fell. \nBut he was less positive about the longer term. \n\u201cA major risk is that prolonged uncertainty and concerns over the UK\u2019s economic outlook ends up weighing down markedly on business investment and damages productivity,\u201d he said. \nBritain\u2019s government has launched repeated efforts to boost productivity, and says past weakness is partly due to strong job creation, which has pushed unemployment to its lowest in more than 40 years. \nONS data also show a drag from the declining North Sea oil and gas sector, and from heavy losses in financial services after the global crisis. Low investment and inconsistent management quality also weigh on productivity, economists say. Graphic by Andy Bruce; Editing by Gareth Jones"}

The little money I had saved to buy seeds became worthless,\u201d adding by the time she changed her notes the price of seed had soared.\nBai now works as a daily laborer, earning 120 Indian rupees ($1.87) a day, which is not enough to support her family of eight that includes five children.\nMORE THAN ENOUGH FOOD The paradox of millions going hungry in India while food goes to waste is receiving increasing amounts of attention as the FAO stresses that one third of food produced globally for human consumption is wasted every year.\nAs the World Economic Forum has highlighted, food production is clearly not the main issue as India needs 225-230 million tonnes of food per year to feed its population - and farm output in 2015-2016 hit more than 270 million tonnes.\nSharad Pawar, a former agriculture minister, once told parliament that nearly 40 percent of the value of annual production was wasted, with crops left to rot in the sun without storage or transportation, or eaten by insects and rats.\nThis wastage has a knock-on effect on the environment as well, as the efforts made to produce this generates greenhouse gases, uses water, and can lead to deforestation.\nBut while India\u2019s Amul, the world\u2019s largest dairy cooperative, has been widely praised for successfully processing huge amounts of milk quickly and safely for years, spurring the so-called \u201cWhite Revolution\u201d in India, authorities have struggled to stop vast amounts of grain wasting every year.\nThe Food Corporation of India (FCI), the nation\u2019s main grain procurement agency set up about 50 years ago, now sits on mounds of rice and wheat and has faced criticism for being too weighed down by process and bureaucracy to solve the problems.\nA report by the government\u2019s Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) published last year involved a detailed analysis on shortcomings of the FCI including wastage, misappropriation, and fraudulent payments.\nAn official with the FCI, who wished to remain anonymous, said a key reason for food waste is damage caused by a lack of infrastructure which it is trying to overcome by investing in building new cold storage facilities over the next five years.\nCHILDREN STUNTED But while this food is wasted, millions of people are going hungry, with 38.4 percent of children aged under five stunted, according to the Global Hunger Index.\n\u201cThis reflects the chronic lack of balanced food,\u201d said Ashish Agarwal, a food rights activist with Aligarh-based non-profit group UDAAN Society that focuses on rural development.\n\u201cThe under-5 mortality rate is 4.8 percent in India, partially because of inadequate nutrition and unhealthy environment.\u201d\nCritics are concerned that it is not enough to just focus on boosting grain storage, as 350 million of India\u2019s 1.3 billion people live in rural locations where electricity is unreliable and erratic so the use of cold storage facilities limited.\nThey want to see improved transportation to move food supplies faster, and faster food processing so less is wasted.\nRaghav Rajan, a farmer from Chakwas village in India\u2019s western Rajasthan state, shies away from government storage, saying traditional storage methods are better to preserve food.\n\u201cWe store fruits and vegetables with neem leaves (a medicinal herb) which act as a pest resistant agent. We also use dry chillies to kill any insects infecting the grains,\u201d said Rajan, talking in a field near his house.\nHe said he preferred to do this as the 1,900 or so storage facilities built by the government around the country are mostly city-based and using them incurred transport costs.\n\u201cMoreover, there is no surety that our crops won\u2019t rot in these facilities,\u201d he added.\nTECHNOLOGY AND PROCESSING The Indian government, however, has said it is trying to stop food losses and address hunger in various ways, including changing distribution strategies and using technology.\nThe Ministry of Food Processing Industries is working with the private sector companies to provide pre-cooling and chilled storage from the farm to the consumer, with about 228 projects underway by August last year.\nSecretary in the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare, Shobhana Pattanayak, said the government distributes excess grain through a public distribution system.\nUnder this system the government buys food grain from farmers and distributes it at subsidized prices to the poor, selling wheat and rice at two and three rupees a kg compared to the market price of 12 and 13 rupees.\nBut the system has come under fire from some locals who say supplies and the quality can be erratic with grain from the distribution system being siphoned off by middlemen who sell it at a higher prices than the market rate.\n\u201cThe superior quality food grains are sold in the black market by the middlemen and the bad quality wheat and rice is given to us at a subsidized rate,\u201d said Ali Sher, head of Pilakhana village in Aligarh district of Uttar Pradesh state.\n\u201cA small quantity of good quality rice is mixed with rotten portion to increase the volume and sold to us at subsidy. It is better to starve than to eat rodent-infested food.\u201d\nSagheer Ahmed, professor at the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, Aligarh Muslim University, said a lack of storage was the main reason for wasted food grain along w"}

Celgene did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. \nIt's unclear how much Celgene would pay for Juno, which had a market value of $7.9 billion as of Wednesday's close of trading. \nSyed said investors could argue, however, that Celgene already has a decent collaboration with Juno and therefore does not need to do a deal. \nCelgene is working with Seattle-based Juno on an experimental new gene therapy designed to treat people with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nThe treatment is a type of so-called CAR T-cell therapy \u2014 taking a patient's own immune cells, called T cells, genetically manipulating them to attack specific proteins on cancer, and infusing them back into the patient.\nDavid Nierengarten, head of health-care equity research at Wedbush, told CNBC, \"Juno wasn't on my list of companies being acquired in the near term.\"\nBut he said, \"Celgene has a big revenue hole to fill over the next few years\" and Juno's treatment could potentially \"fill that gap.\"\nNierengarten also sees the potential value in Celgene owning Juno before a product launch \"so they can have control over the regulatory process\" as well as \"setting up sites and infrastructure for this kind of therapy.\"\nJuno said it could expect approval for its treatment as early as the end of 2018. \nCAR T-cell therapy is a highly competitive and potentially lucrative area of biotechnology.\nNovartis and Gilead Sciences already received the first two approvals of CAR T for other types of cancer. For one-time treatments, they cost $475,000 and $373,000 , respectively. \nWATCH: Celgene to buy Impact Biomedicines in $7 billion deal show chapters Celgene to buy Impact Biomedicines in $7 billion deal      2:56 PM ET Mon, 8 Jan 2018 | 02:45"}

At least 10,000 people have been killed. \nWAM said local Yemeni fighters, backed by UAE troops, raided Houthi strongholds between al-Khoukha and the town of Heys, about 25 km (15 miles) to the east to try to secure Red Sea areas captured last month. \n\u201cEmirati armed forces members and Yemeni resistance fighters managed to cut supply lines for the Houthi coup militias between Hodeidah and Taiz south of Heys city,\u201d WAM said, citing an Emirati army source. \nIt said that dozens of Houthi fighters were killed. \nResidents said that Houthi forces, who control most of Taiz province and surround pro-government forces inside the provincial capital, continue to receive supplies through the adjacent Ibb province. \nA spokesman for the Houthi-controlled Yemeni army could not be reached for a comment and the group\u2019s media outlets made no mention of any fighting in the area.

Amarin plans to discuss these results and expectations with investors in connection with the 36 th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, California, at which Amarin will be presenting.\nPreliminary (unaudited) 2017 Financial Results\nRecord Revenue Levels: Net product revenue for 2017 are estimated to have reached between $177 million and $180 million, including estimated net revenues of $51 million to $54 million in Q4 2017. Both the full year and Q4 2017 results represent record revenue levels for Amarin. These results, which are subject to audit, are estimated to have exceeded the upper end of the company\u2019s previously reported guidance for 2017 net product revenue and represent an increase of approximately $48 million to $51 million (approximately 37% to 40%) over full year 2016 results. Both full year and Q4 2017 net revenue growth were driven by increased prescriptions for Vascepa\u00ae (icosapent ethyl) capsules. Wholesaler inventory levels of Vascepa were within normal industry ranges at the end of 2017.\nBalance Sheet: Amarin ended 2017 with approximately $73.6 million in cash, approximately $44 million in net accounts receivable and approximately $29 million in inventory. During 2017, the company\u2019s net cash outflows, excluding the $13.7 million net proceeds of exchangeable debt transactions disclosed in Q1 2017, were approximately $38.4 million, comprised of net cash outflow in Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 of approximately $15.9, $10.6, $6.4 and $5.5 million, respectively. The company believes that it was effective in 2017 in controlling its cash expenditures to achieve greater contribution from the growing revenues of its commercial operations. The company achieved its stated objective of being net cash flow positive in 2017 after excluding, on a non-GAAP basis, the net proceeds of the Q1 2017 exchangeable debt transactions and excluding greater than $40 million of payments for R&D (primarily REDUCE-IT related) and approximately $17 million of payments for financing-type costs (e.g., interest and royalties).\nThe company\u2019s accounts receivable were all current as of year-end and the company has not factored or otherwise borrowed against accounts receivable, inventory or other assets. Due in part to recent U.S. tax reform, Amarin anticipates further increasing its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in Q4 2017, which will result in a non-cash charge for income taxes of as much as $11.1 million. The deferred tax assets relate to the company\u2019s U.S. subsidiary. The valuation allowance does not change the amount the company pays in income taxes and does not have any impact on the company\u2019s tax loss carryforwards, primarily in Ireland, which are estimated at over $570 million at the end of 2017. At the end of 2017, the company\u2019s debt consisted of $30 million face value of exchangeable debt, which cannot be put to the company before 2022, and the continuing 10% royalty-like obligation on Vascepa net revenue.\nGross Margin: In addition to the company\u2019s increased revenues and improved cash flow, in 2017 Amarin also increased its gross margin on product sales to approximately 75% while taking steps to ensure that it has capacity to support a broad-range of potential revenue scenarios following REDUCE-IT results, including capacity to provide supply to support the potential of over $1 billion in product revenues in 2019. These steps to expand supply capacity are intended to provide the company with flexibility to support business growth. At this time, the company is not providing guidance regarding projected Vascepa net revenue levels after REDUCE-IT results and does not plan to provide such guidance until after the results of this important study are known.\nMore than 150,000 patients currently benefit from Vascepa prescriptions.\n2018 Financial and Operational Guidance\nAmarin's core strategy entering 2018 remains unchanged. Its primary objectives are as follows:\n1) Continue to aggressively grow revenues;\n2) Complete the REDUCE-IT study on a timely basis while maximizing the likelihood of success; and\n3) Operate in a cost-effective, opportunistic manner.\nThe company\u2019s outlook for 2018 is divided between the timeframes before and after anticipated results of the REDUCE-IT cardiovascular outcomes study. REDUCE-IT, which has been the centerpiece of the company\u2019s strategy, is expected to be completed in 2018 with top-line results reported before the end of Q3 2018. The degree of cardiovascular relative risk reduction achieved in this study will impact future levels of Vascepa promotion and revenues. Assuming that statistically significant relative risk reduction of at least 15% is achieved and, as expected, there is no major negative safety issue, the company intends to expand its U.S.-based sales force promptly after the outcomes study results. As previously disclosed, Amarin is planning to grow from its current level of approximately 150 sales representatives calling on targeted physicians in limited geographies, to more than 400 sales representatives with considerably broader reach and increased frequency of sales calls. Amarin plans to support this sales force growth with increased promotional outreach to consumers and other expanded promotion of Vascepa.\nThe financial guidance described below reflects expectations prior to the impact of REDUCE-IT results. The company intends to update guidance after such outcomes study results are known. The company begins 2018 expecting to achieve the following results:\nU.S. Product Revenue : Without adjustment for the impact of REDUCE-IT results, the company estimates full year 2018 net product revenue from Vascepa will grow approximately $50 million to approximately $230 million. Amarin estimates in each quarter of 2018 net product revenue should grow approximately 30% or more as compared to the same quarter in 2017. This guidance for 2018 will be updated after REDUCE-IT results. The company anticipates quarterly variability to continue with respect to net product revenue. For example, seasonal factors associated with large beginning of the year insurance deductibles for patients under certain of their medical insurance plans has historically slowed prescription rates in the first quarter of each year. Amarin estimates that its net product revenue in Q1 2018 will be between $45 and $48 million, representing significant growth ov"}

Jet fuel is the No. 1 cost for the airlines, so they shouldn't be able to rally at the same time \u2014 unless it's their stocks we are talking about,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \"I keep highlighting the bizarrely bullish ways that stocks are trading and sometimes they're totally in your face, like this simultaneous move in the price of oil and the airline stocks.\" \nAnd it's not like the market has forgotten the effects of rising oil prices on the airlines \u2014 shares of Boeing also got a boost because airlines can buy new jets that use less fuel from Boeing to lower their fuel costs. \nBut Cramer remained puzzled by the market's obsession with volatile cryptocurrency bitcoin in the face of actual gains from stocks like Boeing. \nHe shared a story of two cigarette-puffing Wall Streeters asking him incessantly to comment on bitcoin. \"No bitcoin,\" he told them. \"Boeing.\" \n\"I might as well have said, 'Put down those Marlboros and let's go have some of my wife's quinoa,'\" Cramer said. \"Their contempt was palpable. I'm chalking it up to millennial lunacy.\" Bank earnings preview: Don't panic David A. Grogan | CNBC Jamie Dimon speaking at the 2017 Delivering Alpha conference in New York on Sept. 12, 2017. \nFriday marks the unofficial start of earnings season, with big banks J.P. Morgan , Wells Fargo and PNC Financial reporting their quarterly numbers. \nBut Cramer knows the fourth quarter tends to be \"messier\" for financial companies, so he wanted to make sure investors were prepared for the big day. \n\"I'm not trying to predict which banks will do well and which ones won't,\" he said. \"I simply want to help separate the signal from the noise so that you'll be in a position to understand what's actually happening as it happens.\" \nCramer's top concern? When it became clear in December that the tax bill would pass, major lenders like Citigroup started to incur one-time, multi-billion-dollar charges in order to offset future taxes, which could make these earnings look \"horrendous,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. Retail revival? Timothy A. Clary | AFP | Getty Images Shoppers take advantage of Black Friday sales the day after Thanksgiving in New York City November 24, 2017. \nA day of speaking with the retail industry's top brass at the ICR's Conference in Orlando, Florida made Cramer realize that Wall Street might be discounting the sector's comeback. \n\"We're being way too cavalier about the return of retail, including mall-based retail and what it really means,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"We just can't believe that any of these companies can really escape the clutches of the Death Star, Amazon .\" \nAfter hearing that Kohl's delivered same-store sales of over 5 percent for the first time since 2001 and that Children's Place logged an 8.5 percent gain in holiday-season same-store sales, Cramer sensed that these were more than just positive blips on the retail radar screen. \nThen, when Target and Nordstrom's earnings kicked into high gear and both companies raised their holiday sales forecasts, Cramer started to suspect a genuine turn in the group as a whole. \nWith that in mind, Cramer shared five factors that could be driving the retail sector back into Wall Street's good graces. Denny's CEO: Bringing the 'old diner' back \nDenny's turnaround is all but a wholesale reinvention of the old-line diner chain, President and CEO John Miller told CNBC in an interview with Cramer. \n\"People said they want their old diner back,\" Miller told Cramer at the ICR Conference . \"It needed to be a place appropriate for dinner, so we warmed it up a little, divided the spaces.\" \nNow, about 67 percent of the Denny's network has embraced the chain's new image, with that number expected to rise to 80 percent by the end of 2018, Miller said. \nBesides refurbishing the stores, Denny's also introduced Denny's On Demand , which lets customers order food for take-out or delivery; new packaging for its food; health-focused meal options; value-oriented menus starting at $2; and meal personalization. \n\"We believe ... a great society runs best when you sort of push responsibility down,\" Miller said. \"Give people choice. Let them make their own decision. You want to indulge in a shake on Sunday, we'll sell it to you. But Monday morning you can have a Fit Slam egg white omelet.\" Away CEO talks brand engagement \nAway's digital-savvy luggage (complete with USB charging ports) has been exploding in popularity in two ways, co-founder and CEO Steph Korey told CNBC. \n\"The No. 1 way our customers find out about us is a recommendation from a friend,\" Korey told Cramer at the ICR Conference . \"We find that if we can create a special experience \u2013 like our web experience, our purchasing experience, our in-store experience, our product experience, how you travel \u2013 if we can create something that leaves a lasting impression with people, that's so rare these days that they'll tell everyone they know about it.\" \nThe second-biggest way people hear about Away? Instagram. And Korey said that's not only because of her company's social media prowess. \n\"Everyone's Instagramming when they're traveling and when they're seeing the world, so what we've really done is highly encourage our customers that when you're traveling and doing cool things, share it,\" she said. \"Inspire your networks and share what you're doing. So now, when people are traveling, they're going somewhere new, they're Instagramming themselves with their luggage and that's how people are finding out about it.\" Lightning Round: Stick with SLB \nIn Cramer's lightning round , he zoomed through his take on some callers' favorite stocks: \nCore Laboratories : \"I like Core Labs, but no need to go there if you own Schlumberger . Stick with that horse and buy more if it goes back to $72.\" \nCedar Fair, L.P. : \"You know what, I like them. I like how they're very streamlined and, most of all, I like the 5 percent yield.\" \nDisclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Citigroup, J.P.

I just ignored the whole Olympics aspect of it and skated how I know how.\u201d \nNagasu, meanwhile, failed to stick her signature jump in a nervous start to what she hopes will be Olympic redemption but still recovered to challenge Tennell. \nThe 24-year-old wept openly after being overlooked for the 2014 American team for Sochi, despite finishing third at the U.S. championships that year. \nFour years after that crushing disappointment, Nagasu entered this year\u2019s championships with the distinction of being only the second American after Tonya Harding to land a triple Axel in international competition.

Mandatory Credit: Stan Szeto-USA TODAY Sports \nAfter a nervous warm-up, Nagasu started her routine with the triple Axel but stumbled upon landing, although she stayed on her feet. She regrouped, however, and was rewarded with the highest technical score of the night. \n\u201cI think I did a great job. To go down in history is all I\u2019ve ever wanted,\u201d said Nagasu, who makes no secret of her desire to atone for 2014. \n\u201cI wish I had the mental ability of (multiple gold medal-winning swimmer) Michael Phelps but I think my journey has been about getting up... I\u2018m so proud to still be here today.\u201d Slideshow (5 Images) \nTennell and Nagasu are well clear of third-placed Karen Wang on 69.48, with triple national champion Ashley Wagner languishing down in fifth place on 65.94. \n\u201cI\u2019ve head a really mental season, I\u2018m not going to lie about that,\u201d said Wagner, referring to her recent mediocre form. \n\u201cThis was solid. You can lose an event in the short program and my main focus was to get through this, not get too far behind and get myself a close enough distance to make a real killing in the long.\u201d \nThe ladies\u2019 event concludes on Friday with the long program. \nThe first three finishers are not guaranteed of selection, as Nagasu discovered in 2014, but know a strong finish will be hard to ignore.

You feel conflicted but then you figure, \u2018I\u2019m not going to let a guy drive me out of my own house.'\u201d \nAfter Dempsey left the show in 2015, things took a positive turn for Pompeo. Not only did the show\u2019s ratings spike, but she negotiated an unprecedented deal with Rhimes and the production studio that gave her more creative control and ownership of her career. \nAfter Rhimes signed a nine-figure deal with Netflix last August, Pompeo says she told the creator, \u201cIf you\u2019re moving on to Netflix and you want the show to go down, I\u2019m cool with that.

(OTC PINK: USEI) a California based company, poised to capitalize on California\u2019s legal cannabis industry focusing on the manufacturing and extraction of oil from cannabis is pleased to announce today that its Board of Directors has declared two (2) dividends in the form of warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock; a 1 for 10 or a 10% warrant to shareholders of record on the record date.\nThe warrants will be issued on pay-date of February 26, 2018 to shareholders of record as of February 16, 2018. Each shareholder of the Company's common stock will receive one warrant for every ten shares owned (10% of their holdings) as of the record date (with the number of warrants rounded up to the nearest whole number). The first warrant will entitle the holder to purchase 10% of their holdings of the Company's common stock equal to the exercise price per share price on March 30, 2018. The second warrant will entitle the holder to purchase 10% of their holdings of the Company's common stock at an exercise price share price on March 30, 2018 plus a 50% premium to that same price (For example .010 +.005 =.015). Combined these warrants represent a 20% warrant to the shareholder. (For example, if a shareholder has 1 million shares these warrants allow the shareholder of record to acquire an additional 200,000 shares at these prices). These warrants will be for a 3-year term from the date of issue, non-transferable, with the restricted shares being issued upon exercise. Funds raised because of this warrant will fund the company's likelihood of becoming a reporting issuer with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC and future growth of the company\u2019s business model. Further details of this warrant will be disclosed in a future press release.\nAccording to Anthony Miller, CEO, \u201c This is the 3rd dividend that the company has issued to its shareholders in recent years\u2026 and this event has been planned for a few months. It is management\u2019s opinion that the issuance in this case is a beneficial activity for this firm, as it is transitioning to a more profitable business model. This month we begin to actively manufacture oil extractions from cannabis utilizing the MRX extraction technology that we purchased last month. This device is the first in a series of purchases that the company will make to keep pace in the growing demand for cannabis products now that California has become the largest legal marketplace in the world.\n\u201cOur goal is to produce a wide range of extracted products; and we plan to actively expand our operation aggressively. We start production on the first day of delivery and these devices will all be operating on a 24\/7\/365 basis. Revenue produced will allow us to become profitable on the first day of operation; and we believe that there is capital to fund growth. However, it is management\u2019s opinion that the warrant announced today will fuel our expansion so that we can continue to grow our opportunity. Management further believes that any additional capital raising should come from those folks who are and have been participating in the growth of this company thus far. Creating toxic dilution of the company\u2019s stock to the detriment of those who have been holding strong with us for some time is not acceptable.\n\u201cManagement, further intends to file with the SEC to finally become a reporting issuer so that the company will have greater transparency and become financially responsible. The cannabis industry requires true and an accurate representation of every dime made, and it is our goal to become fully transparent to the public market in the same manner. In the coming weeks, management will continue to disclose our progress including video of our delivery and extraction operations and post our progress on twitter, Facebook and on the company\u2019s websites. Our future is awesome, and it was encouraging to see other companies, in the state of Oregon, that started just like us, with just one device and now up to 7 additional devices in less than three year (3) making millions of dollars annually, and their market is only 1\/5 of the California market.\n\u201cFinally, management believes that this 20% dividend could represent a significant opportunity to the shareholders of record because of two reasons 1) management believes that if management executes its business model the share value should become commensurate with revenues produced by our activities and 2) capital provided because these dividends will fuel growth, and both factors could be beneficial to the company.\u201d commented Miller\nAbout U.S. Energy Initiatives: U.S. Energy Initiatives Corporation (OTC PINK: USEI) is a diverse energy firm.

FILE PHOTO: The Intel logo is shown at the E3 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 13, 2017. REUTERS\/ Mike Blake\/File Photo \nThese flaws are security holes in nearly every computing device that make their data vulnerable to hacking. \nThe problem surfaced early this week when news broke that researchers were planning to release technical reports on the threats, sending businesses, governments and consumers scrambling to understand the extent of the threat and the cost of fixes. No clear consensus has emerged. \n\u201cIntel continues to believe that the performance impact of these updates is highly workload-dependent and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time,\u201d the world\u2019s No. 1 chipmaker said in a release. \nThe release cited comments from Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ), Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ), Alphabet Inc\u2019s ( GOOGL.O ) and Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ), which said that they had seen no significant impact to performance after installing the patches. \nThey were among a group of firms that quickly patched their technology to mitigate against the threat from one of those vulnerabilities, dubbed Meltdown, which only affects machines running Intel chips. \nMajor software makers have not issued patches to protect against the second vulnerability, dubbed Spectre, which affects nearly all computer chips made in the last decade. However, Google, Firefox and Microsoft have implemented measures in most web browsers to stop hackers from launching remote attacks using Spectre. \nGovernments and security experts say they have observed no cyber attacks seeking to exploit either vulnerability, though they expect hackers to attempt to do so as they digest technical data about the security flaws. \nOne key risk is that hackers will develop code that can infect the personal computers of people visiting malicious websites, said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer of cyber security firm Veracode. \nHe advised PC owners to install the security patches to protect against such potential attacks. There is less risk to computer servers at large enterprises, he said, because those systems are not used to surf the web and can only be infected in a Meltdown attack if a hacker has already breached that network. \nMicrosoft has issued a patch for its Windows operating system, and Apple desktop users with the most recent operating system are protected. Google has said most of its Chromebook laptops are already protected and the rest will be soon. \nApple said it plans to release a patch to its Safari web browser within coming days to protect Mac and iOS users from Spectre. \nWhile third-party browsers from Google and others can protect Mac users from Spectre, all major web browsers for Apple\u2019s iOS devices depend on receiving a patch from Apple. That means hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users will be exposed to potential Spectre attacks while browsing the Web until Apple issues its patch.

A further 70 store openings are planned for this year. \n\u201cWe see significant capacity for further growth as there are still more than 400 towns and cities across the UK without an Aldi store,\u201d Aldi UK & Ireland CEO Matthew Barnes said on Thursday. \n\u201cShoppers in these areas consistently tell us they would shop at Aldi if they could, and we are committed to meeting this demand for new Aldi stores,\u201d he added. \nAldi\u2019s expansion plans have not been slowed by three straight years of falling profit. It says its German parent, Aldi Sud, is investing in the UK for the long term. \nIndustry data published last month put Aldi\u2019s UK grocery market share at 6.9 percent, up 0.7 percentage points on the year. Last year it overtook the Co-operative Group to become Britain\u2019s fifth largest grocer. \nWith its expansion plans it now has Morrisons, which currently has a market share of 10.6 percent, in its sights. PREMIUM DEMAND \nAldi said its sales rose over 15 percent in December year-on-year, taking the annual figure for the UK and Ireland over 10 billion pounds ($13.5 billion) for the first time. Sales in 2016 were 8.74 billion pounds. \nAldi did not provide a like-for-like sales number. \nBernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said the 15 percent number was largely driven by additional space and inflation. He estimated volume like-for-like growth of 2.5 percent, which he said implied a slowdown from last year. \nAldi UK said it saw a surge in demand for its premium \u201cSpecially Selected\u201d products, with sales increasing by over 30 percent during December. \nIt said top-selling premium products included Aberdeen Angus beef roasting joints and Irish cream liqueur. \n\u201cAlthough we saw strong growth across all categories, the performance of our premium Specially Selected range in particular surpassed all expectations,\u201d said Barnes. \nAldi UK also said on Thursday it would pay its store assistants a minimum of 8.85 pounds an hour from Feb. 1 - matching the rate recommended by campaigning group Living Wage Foundation. \nTesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons are all scheduled to update on Christmas trading next week.

It was originally imposed in 2013 as one of several taxes and fees in the Affordable Care Act that pay for expanded health insurance under the law.\nThe tax was strongly opposed by the $150 billion a year industry that produces everything from catheters to heart stents to artificial joints. In Congress, it was unpopular not only with Republicans but many Democrats from states like Massachusetts and Minnesota with large numbers of medical device companies.\nCongress voted to suspend the tax for 2016 and 2017 with the widespread expectation it would be permanently abolished before 2018. But various GOP efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the taxes associated with it failed, and the sweeping federal tax overhaul recently signed by President Donald Trump didn't eliminate the medical device tax either.\nIndustry groups Including the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed) and the Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance warn the tax will take a $20 billion bite out of the industry over the next decade.\n\"What we have seen from past experience is that it comes out of funding for product development, research and the jobs associated with those things,\" said J.C. Scott, AdvaMed's head of government affairs. \"We fear we will see employment freezes or reductions and a slowdown in the pipeline for medical innovation.\"\nThe slashing of the overall corporate tax from 35 percent to 21 percent may soften the blow for some manufacturers, industry officials say, but not for all. As the excise tax is applied to sales and not income, it will fall harder on smaller firms and startups with promising new products that have yet to yield profits.\nSupporters of the tax contend manufacturers have overstated both the harm suffered while the tax was in effect, and the potential impact of its resumption. They argue expansion of health coverage under the ACA benefited medical device makers by boosting the potential market for their products and note other sectors \u2014 including private insurers and pharmaceutical companies \u2014 also pay taxes and fees toward the health law and complain less about them.\nDevice makers certainly aren't giving up their fight. They still hold out hope of repealing or again suspending the tax.\nDespite earlier failures, industry officials say congressional backing for repeal remains strong. The next attempt could come in connection with a spending bill needed by Jan. 19 to avert a government shutdown.\nBoston Scientific , a leading maker of heart stents and other devices, estimates reinstatement of the tax will cost the Marlborough, Massachusetts-based firm $75 million in 2018. The company said when the tax was suspended it invested the savings in projects including a partnership with Mayo Clinic that combines manufacturing expertise with ideas from physicians for new products to help patients.\n\"The reinstatement of the device tax threatens continued investment in programs like these,\" Boston Scientific said in a statement.\nSome Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have said they won't support repeal of the tax unless an equivalent source of revenue is found for the ACA.\nIn a Dec. 20 letter to Trump, AdvaMed urged the president to support repeal of the tax and, in the interim, direct the IRS to grant companies \"administrative relief\" from the tax. That could include such steps as waiving the bimonthly deposit requirement or any penalties resulting from late payments.\n\"Retroactive action by Congress next year cannot fully undo the impact of allowing this tax to be triggered on Jan. 1,\" the companies wrote."}

Some may face political opposition, as U.S. senators traditionally have some say in the nominations of U.S. Attorneys who would serve within their states.\nMany of Sessions\u2019 appointments were in Democratic-leaning states such as New York, New Jersey and California. The Republicans hold the majority in the Senate.\nAmong those named was Geoffrey Berman, who served on Republican Trump\u2019s transition team. Berman will become the interim top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, a jurisdiction that is well known for terrorism cases, prosecutions of Wall Street financial crimes and government corruption.\nBerman, who was an assistant U.S. Attorney in Manhattan from 1990 to 1994, is a partner at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig.

Family members have said the two told them they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some documents by the officers they had gone to meet. \nThe two had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where - according to U.N. estimates - about 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants. \n\u201cThey arrested us and took action against us because we were trying to reveal the truth,\u201d Wa Lone told reporters as he and Kyaw Soe Oo were led out of the court and back to Yangon\u2019s Insein prison after the 30-minute hearing. \nKhin Maung Zaw, a lawyer representing the two journalists, said the charges being sought came under Section 3.1 (c) of the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act. \nThe act dates back to 1923, when Myanmar, then known as Burma, was a province of British India. \nSection 3 covers entering prohibited places, taking images or handling secret official documents that \u201cmight be or is intended to be, directly or indirectly, useful to an enemy\u201d. \nThe Ministry of Information had previously cited police as saying they were \u201carrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces\u201d. The ministry has said they \u201cillegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media\u201d. \nThe prosecutor objected to an application for bail, the reporters\u2019 lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, said. The court took it under consideration and will decide at the next hearing on Jan. 23, he said. \nThe government has said two police officers were also arrested for investigation under suspicion of having violated the Official Secrets Act. It has given no further information on the police arrested. \nAbout 30 journalists were outside the court, most dressed in black as a sign of protest against the arrest of the pair. Several had the message \u201cjournalism is not a crime\u201d or \u201crelease the arrested journalists now\u201d on their T-shirts. HANDCUFFED \nIn the court, Kyaw Soe Oo embraced his wife and held his daughter for a couple of minutes. His daughter began to weep as he was escorted away and he had to hand her back to other family members. \nWa Lone\u2019s wife gave him a few small pieces of cake that she had brought. \n\u201dI am trying to be strong in everything. I never made any mistake; I never did anything wrong,\u201d Wa Lone said before leaving the court. \nThe two journalists arrived and left court in handcuffs. \n(Click tmsnrt.rs\/2BHDUx8 for profiles of the two) Reuters journalist Wa Lone arrives at the court in Yangon, Myanmar January 10, 2018. REUTERS\/Stringer NO RESALES NO ARCHIVES \nDistraught relatives of Kyaw Soe Oo wailed and reached out to grasp him as the two journalists were driven away from a throng of reporters after the hearing. \nReuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J. Adler said he was extremely disappointed that the authorities were seeking to prosecute the pair. \n\u201cWe view this as a wholly unwarranted, blatant attack on press freedom. Our colleagues should be allowed to return to their jobs reporting on events in Myanmar. We believe time is of the essence and we continue to call for Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo\u2019s prompt release,\u201d he said. \nGovernment spokesman Zaw Htay declined to comment on the charges but said the two had their rights under an independent judicial system. \n\u201cThe judge will be decide whether they are guilty or not according to the law,\u201d he told Reuters. \nA spokesman for the military was not available for comment.

We call for their immediate release,\u201d it said in a statement. \nThe French foreign ministry called in a statement for the journalists\u2019 immediate release and for the free access of media to Rakhine State. Authorities have largely banned media from the conflict zone. \nFormer U.S. President Bill Clinton has urged that they be freed immediately, saying on Twitter on Monday that a free press was critical for a free society and the detention of journalists anywhere was unacceptable. \nClinton was U.S. president for much of the 1990s when the United States pressed Myanmar\u2019s then military rulers to release democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi from years of house arrest. \nJapan wants to raise the matter of the two reporters with the Myanmar government at appropriate opportunities, including a visit by Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono this week, Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said in Tokyo. \nPhil Robertson of the group Human Rights Watch said that \u201dif Aung San Suu Kyi and her government really cared about democratic reforms and governance, they could use their parliamentary majority to quickly reform this antiquated colonial law and bring it into compliance with international human rights standards.\u201d \nSuu Kyi won a 2015 election and formed Myanmar\u2019s first civilian government in more than half a century in early 2016, although she is barred by the constitution from becoming president. \nShe has made no public comment on the detention of the two Reuters reporters.

We\u2019ve actually played some good cricket along the way. We\u2019ve not been blown away in every game. \n\u201cEvery game has gone to the fifth day. It doesn\u2019t feel like a completely disastrous series. We know we\u2019ve got to improve in a number of areas.\u201d \nAnderson said the absence of all-rounder Ben Stokes, who was suspended after an incident outside a nightclub in September, and various off-field incidents at the start of the series had not had an impact on the series. \nHe also thought the preparations had been adequate. \u201dI don\u2019t know what we could have done differently,\u201c he added. \u201dYou can do all the preparation you want. We\u2019ve worked tirelessly in the nets. We\u2019ve planned very well, meticulously. But you can\u2019t prepare for being out in the middle when the pressure is on. \n\u201cThe only thing that can prepare you for that is being in it and we\u2019ve not dealt with those pressure situations well with bat or ball and that\u2019s been the difference in this series.\u201d \nA veteran of seven Ashes series, Anderson said he hoped to be around to play an eighth in England next year as a 37-year-old. \n\u201cI\u2018m going to do everything I possibly can be to be ready for that series in 2019,\u201d said the seamer, who took 17 wickets at 27.82. \n\u201cI\u2018m still hungry to play. I\u2018m delighted I\u2019ve got through these five test matches and bowled pretty well.\u201d \nAnderson also thought Joe Root, who left his sick bed to try to save a draw on Monday, had been outstanding as captain. \n\u201cYou ask any captain that has toured Australia, it is not an easy place to come, not an easy place to play, especially when you\u2019re on the wrong end of results,\u201d he said. \n\u201dI think the way he has carried himself is a real credit to himself. He\u2019s been fantastic all the whole way through, a very level-headed guy. \n\u201cHe\u2019s not looked down at any stage and he\u2019s led the guys brilliantly both on and off the field. He should be very proud of what he\u2019s done this trip.\u201d (Editing by Peter Rutherford)"}

Walbert, chairman, president and chief executive officer, Horizon Pharma plc. \u201cBased on our commercial expansion for KRYSTEXXA and a larger anticipated addressable patient population for both KRYSTEXXA and teprotumumab, we see significant opportunity ahead.\n\u201cWe are also announcing several additions to our rheumatology development pipeline, including MEDI4945, a potential next-generation gout biologic to support and sustain our leadership of the uncontrolled gout market,\u201d continued Walbert. \u201cWe are expanding the investment now to advance the next phase of our Company\u2019s strategy, which is to build a robust development-stage pipeline to generate long-term value for shareholders.\u201d\nUpdated Peak Net Sales Expectations and Market Opportunities for KRYSTEXXA and Teprotumumab\nFollowing additional analysis of the addressable patient population and market opportunities for both KRYSTEXXA and teprotumumab in the United States, as well as a significant commercial expansion for KRYSTEXXA, the Company is increasing its estimated peak annual net sales expectations for each medicine to more than $750 million. Previously, peak net sales expectations for KRYSTEXXA were more than $400 million and peak net sales expectations for teprotumumab were more than $250 million.\nKRYSTEXXA is the only medicine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults living with uncontrolled gout, chronic gout that is refractory (not responsive) to conventional gout therapies. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed its second expansion of its KRYSTEXXA commercial organization, approximately doubling it in size. In addition, through new outreach efforts to nephrologists, the Company\u2019s estimated addressable patient population for KRYSTEXXA has doubled from 50,000 to 100,000 patients. Nephrologists treat chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients of whom 25 to 50 percent have concurrent gout. Additionally, approximately half of people living with gout also have CKD. The Company continues to expect 2018 net sales growth for KRYSTEXXA of more than 50 percent.\nTeprotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody IGF-IR-inhibitor being studied in a confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of a rare eye disease, thyroid eye disease (TED). If approved, it would be the only FDA-approved medicine available to treat TED. Following additional market research and analysis of the treatable TED patient population, the Company now assumes a larger addressable patient population exists. It estimates that the annual U.S. incidence of moderate-to-severe active TED is between 15,000 and 20,000 patients.\nPipeline Developments: Rheumatology Candidates and Programs\nThe Company announced several developments today to its growing pipeline related to its Rheumatology products, including KRYSTEXXA. KRYSTEXXA is a recombinant protein of uricase, an enzyme not found in humans, and PEGylation, a synthetic technology used to extend the half-life of uricase. As with many biologic medicines, some people treated with KRYSTEXXA may develop antidrug antibodies as part of an immune response to the medicine, a reaction known as immunogenicity, and lose response to therapy.\nHZN-003 (Potential Next-Generation Biologic for Uncontrolled Gout Using Optimized Uricase and Optimized PEGylation Technology)\nEarlier today, the Company announced that has licensed HZN-003 (formerly MEDI4945), a potential next-generation biologic for uncontrolled gout, from MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca. HZN-003 is a pre-clinical, genetically engineered uricase derivative with optimized uricase and optimized PEGylation technology that has the potential to improve the response rate to the biologic as well as the potential for subcutaneous dosing.\nPotential Next-Generation Biologic for Uncontrolled Gout Using PASylation Technology\nThe Company also recently entered into a collaboration agreement with XL-protein GmbH to identify clinical-stage product candidates that could use PASylation technology to construct a next-generation gout biologic. PASylation technology is a biological alternative to synthetic PEGylation and is intended to extend both the half-life of uricase and the duration of treatment for people living with uncontrolled gout, and also has the potential for subcutaneous dosing. If the collaboration agreement identifies clinical-stage candidates, the Company will have the right to license the candidates.\nKRYSTEXXA Investigator-Initiated Trials: RECIPE and TRIPLE\nIn addition to these new programs, two investigator-initiated trials will evaluate the use of immunomodulatory therapies to enhance the response rate for KRYSTEXXA. The studies will use different immunomodulators, both of which rheumatologists are very familiar with and comfortable prescribing.\nThe University of Alabama at Birmingham Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology is expected to begin a clinical trial in the first quarter of 2018 evaluating the use of the immunomodulator mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) along with KRYSTEXXA to improve the response rate to the medicine. RE du C ing I mmunogenicity to P egloticas E (RECIPE) is a double-blind, placebo controlled trial is designed to evaluate if a 12-week course of immunomodulating therapy with daily MMF can safely and meaningfully prevent the incidence of an immune response to KRYSTEXXA. The study will also assess the incidence and types of adverse events and infusion reactions related to the medicine. More detailed information about the RECIPE study is available at ClinicalTrials.gov .\nThe second investigator-initiated trial is the T olerization R educes I ntolerance to P egloticase and Prolongs the Urate L owering E ffect (TRIPLE) study. An exploratory, open-label adaptive trial with multiple patient cohorts, TRIPLE will include a cohort to evaluate the impact of adding the immunomodulator azathioprine for a 2-week run-in period, followed by daily azathioprine and KRYSTEXXA every 2 weeks for a total of 13 doses. The immunomodulation arm of the study is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2018. More detailed information about the TRIPLE study is available at ClinicalTrials.gov .\nHZN-002 (Potential Targeted Novel Dexamethasone Conjugate for Inflammatory Diseases)\nThe Company has licensed an additional pipeline compound to augment its rheumatology portfolio: HZN-002, a preclinical, targeted novel dexamethasone conjugate with "}

{"published":"2018-01-18T20:26:00.000+02:00","title":"Insurers take a hard look at California and see growing wildfire risk","text":"SHARES Marcus Yam | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images Firefighters work to put out flames after it has engulfed a home on December 5, 2017 in Ventura, California. \nAfter the wildfire disasters in California, it may be tougher for some homeowners in canyon and hillside areas of the state to keep their current insurance. \nIt also could force some homeowners in areas deemed a high risk to go to a fall-back insurance plan created by the state decades ago, California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones told CNBC in an interview. He also said it's not only rural areas but now some urban-type areas of the state that are increasingly getting viewed by insurers as an elevated fire risk. \nInsurers refused to renew more than 10,000 policies in fire-hazard areas in 2016 after previous fire disasters. And, following last year's devastating wildfire season that trend could repeat itself. \nAlso, the Southern California community of Montecito had deadly mudslides on Jan. 9 in areas burned by the record-breaking Thomas wildfire . The seaside town was not in a recognized flood zone so many homeowners reportedly didn't have flood insurance. \n\"There are some number of communities that have already been experiencing challenges in some cases with obtaining private residential homeowners insurance,\" said Jones. \nAccording to Jones, the problem of obtaining private homeowners insurance has shown up in foothill communities and so-called wildland-urban interface areas of the state. Mark Neuling | CNBC A resident searches through the debris after wildfires destroyed his home in Santa Rosa, Calif. \nFor example, Santa Rosa \u2014 the largest city in Sonoma County \u2014 had about 3,000 homes, or 5 percent of its housing stock, go up in flames from last October's wildfires. It also is the deadliest wildfire in state history with 44 victims. \nThe insurance losses from October's wildfires in California topped $9.4 billion in residential and commercial claims, according to the state's Department of Insurance. \nIn Southern California, more than 13,500 homes in Los Angeles and Ventura counties are considered at high or extremely high wildfire risk, according to CoreLogic, a real estate information firm. Last month, Corelogic also indicated that nearly 73,000 other homes in the region were at low or moderate risk of wildfire hazards. \nJones said the private insurers today use computer models to assign fire risk scores to homes, and they are using that data sometimes when deciding to decline renewal on certain insurance policies or to stop writing policies in wildfire-prone areas. \nMore than 2 million homes in California are considered at high or extreme risk from wildfires , making the Golden State the most wildfire-prone state in sheer numbers, according to Verisk, a data analytics supplier to the insurance industry. It also estimates that 15 percent of the state's housing stock is exposed to elevated wildfire hazards. \n\"The fires that occurred at the end of 2017 burned areas, including significantly urbanized areas like parts of Santa Rosa where whole subdivisions burned to the ground,\" Jones said. Previously, he said that area was considered at a low risk under the insurance industry models. \nJones said he anticipates that the insurance industry will update its models based on the recent disasters. \n\"Some areas of the state that have been historically modeled at lower risk will have homes modeled at higher risk, and there may be additional challenges in those areas in finding private residential homeowners insurance,\" he said. \nStill, the big fire losses last year don't mean California homeowners can expect a massive rate hike right away . \nA state ballot measure passed in 1988 by California voters means insurers cannot take all the losses associated with one event, such as the 2017 wildfires, and then simply put them into the next year's property and casualty insurance rates. \n\"At least 20 years of catastrophes are essentially averaged out,\" said Jones. \"It has the effect of preventing cramming all of the $9.4 billion and counting into next year's rates. There will be some impact, but it's not going to be that they can put the entirety of losses into next year's rates.\" \nAfter the huge losses from the 6.7 magnitude earthquake of 1994 in LA, some insurers such as Allstate Insurance stopped writing new homeowner policies in the state. Allstate returned nine years later, though, and that was after the state established the California Earthquake Authority (CEA), a publicly managed organization to sell earthquake insurance policies. \nJones, a Democrat who is running for California attorney general, doesn't expect to see insurers leave California due to the string of natural disasters. \nThe state official said the reason why some insurers left after the 1994 earthquake was due largely to a California requirement at the time that they offer insurance earthquake policies for homeowners. Today, the CEA is the largest provider of residential earthquake insurance in the state and has dozens of participating insurance companies offering its policies, including Allstate. \n\"Homeowner insurers still have the ability to decide where the risk is too high in parts of California, and decline to renew or write [policies]\" he said. \"And that's what we're beginning to see.\" \nMeantime, there are at least eight insurance-related bills being proposed by state lawmakers in the aftermath of the disasters, including a measure that would limit insurers' ability to cut coverage in areas after a wildfire disaster. At least five other states already curb insurance companies from canceling or non-renewing policies after a natural disaster."}

A combination of two photos show German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader Martin Schulz as they attend a debate of the lower house of parliament Bundestag in Berlin, Germany, December 12, 2017. REUTERS\/Fabrizio Bensch \nChancellor Angela Merkel hopes to secure a fourth term in office by persuading the centre-left SPD to extend the \u201cgrand coalition\u201d that ruled Germany for the past four years, even though both blocs suffered big losses in September\u2019s election. \nExploratory talks are scheduled from Jan. 7 to Jan 12. \nThe SPD, which initially wanted to stay in opposition, has agreed to explore the possibility in the interest of political stability after Merkel\u2019s coalition talks with two smaller parties collapsed in November. But SPD officials have made no promises. \nPolicy papers prepared by Bavaria\u2019s CSU, sister party to Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, point to difficult negotiations ahead at a time when Merkel and others are calling for quick work to form a stable new government. \nThe CSU, historically more conservative than Merkel\u2019s larger party, will play a key role in the coalition talks. The two conservative parties have presented a more unified front in recent months after prolonged conflict over Merkel\u2019s decision in 2015 to welcome more than one million migrants to Germany. \nIn a paper leaked last week, the CSU said it wanted military spending to reach NATO\u2019s target of 2 percent of national output, called for a hardline position on immigration, and rejected closer European integration, charting a collision course with the SPD. \nNow, draft policy papers prepared for a CSU party meeting this week set up further conflicts. \nIn one paper, first reported by German magazine Focus, the CSU calls for cuts in corporate tax rates, given U.S. tax cuts and similar moves afoot in Britain and France. \n\u201cIf Germany does not act, it will in the near future have one of the highest corporate tax rates in international comparison,\u201d the paper said. \nSPD parliamentary group leader Andrea Nahles has called for increasing taxes on the wealthy. Her party is pressing for more spending on infrastructure, education, health care and other social priorities. \nAnother CSU paper called for cuts in benefits for asylum seekers to discourage more migrants from coming to Germany, the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper reported late on Monday. \nInstead of transitioning to higher regular welfare payments after 15 months, asylum-seekers would continue to receive the lower basic aid for 36 months. \n\u201cWe want to reduce social welfare payments for asylum seekers so that Germany does not remain the main magnet for refugees from the whole world,\u201d Alexander Dobrindt, a top CSU official told the newspaper. \nPressure is mounting on Merkel to form a new government three months after the election. \nFormer finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, now president of the lower house of parliament, said on Saturday he could not rule out a minority government if no deal emerged. \nAnother alternative would be a new election, but political experts say that could result in further gains for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which parlayed concerns about migration to enter parliament for the first time in September.

Trump, a Republican, won the state-by-state electoral college vote which decides the winner of U.S. presidential elections.\nAny further delay in investigating voter fraud is likely to further weaken Trump\u2019s allegations. But investigating voter fraud might complicate efforts by DHS to help states prevent cyber attacks on the 2018 midterm elections.\nThe commission, which Democrats and voting rights experts have attacked as meritless, was established in May last year but its work stalled when many states refused its request for data about registered voters.\nGiven almost no advance notice, DHS officials scrambled on Wednesday night to inform stakeholders that Trump\u2019s mandate would not interfere with efforts to help state and local election officials bolster their voting infrastructure against potential cyber attacks, according to a senior U.S. official.\nThe order to investigate claims of voter fraud might damage cooperation with states on cyber security, which officials see as a threat heading into the midterms in November.\nStates have been increasingly eager to work with the Trump administration on cyber issues but many have criticized the voter fraud initiative, saying it is groundless and distracts from legitimate issues, like hacking threats.\n\u201cIf (DHS) were to start investigating these non-existent voter fraud claims, that would be very problematic,\u201d said Edgardo Cortes, Virginia\u2019s chief election official, who rejected the commission\u2019s request last year for data about voters registered in Virginia. Cortes said he would also turn down DHS if it asked for the same data.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Thursday that the Trump administration was sending \u201cpreliminary findings\u201d to DHS, which would \u201cmake determinations on the best way forward from that point.\u201d\nDHS spokesman Houlton added that Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a former co-chairman of the White House\u2019s now-disbanded election integrity commission, was not advising DHS.\nKobach told news media this week that he expected officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a branch within DHS, to continue the work of the commission.

Brown is one of several governors pushing climate policies as the federal government backs off. \nBy Arthur van Benthem Oren Cass \nWhen scientists from 13 U.S. federal agencies issued a report on climate change in November that drew a direct connection between human activity and global warming, it was a reminder of the turmoil that has surrounded environmental issues since President Donald Trump took office. \nThe Trump administration has rejected the international Paris climate accord, calling it a job-killing pact that impinges on U.S. sovereignty. It also has moved to repeal the domestic Clean Power Plan, following up on the president\u2019s pledge to boost the energy industry by cutting regulation. \nIn response, several state governors have pledged to take the initiative on climate change by crafting their own strict emissions standards and pursuing the development of renewable energy with renewed vigor. \nSupporters say such actions not only will benefit the environment but also will spur the development of the green-technology industry. \nBut critics say that such state initiatives have a record of being ill conceived and ineffective, and that policies that run counter to the federal government\u2019s stand on the climate in international talks are beyond the rightful scope of state governments. \nArthur van Benthem, an energy economist at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, argues for state action. Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, makes the contrary case. YES: states can mitigate damage done by the federal government By Arthur van Benthem \nGiven the state of affairs in Washington, D.C., states should adopt their own policies to promote renewable energy and limit the emissions of greenhouse gases. \nAmbitious governments in China, Europe and elsewhere are ramping up pressure on their companies to become world leaders in green energy, electric vehicles and low-carbon technologies, in an effort to seize the golden opportunity that comes with the rise of the global green-tech market. \nMeanwhile, the U.S. federal government is backing away from those same policies, rejecting the Paris accord and hitting the brakes on fuel-economy rules and efforts to reduce carbon emissions under the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan. \nAlso read: Clean-energy jobs seen rising to 24 million by 2030, international energy agency says \nSeveral states, spearheaded by the governors of California, New York and Washington, have pledged to fill the void in leadership by adopting their own strict climate policies. In principle, having a single federal policy is cheaper for industry and less prone to unintended consequences. But an unwieldy patchwork of 50 different state policies is an extremely unlikely outcome of state initiatives. \nMuch more likely, state efforts will eventually spur demand for strict federal policies, and operate at a regional level in the meantime. But they also could be short-circuited if the Clean Power Plan is replaced with weak federal regulation of carbon emissions that would preclude stricter state rules, or if the waiver that allows California to set vehicle standards that are tougher than federal regulations isn\u2019t extended. \nIt is imperative that states be allowed to proceed unhindered. If they are, here are the highlights of what is likely to happen: two sets of vehicle regulations, as we have now for electric vehicles and local air pollution, and broad regional cap-and-trade systems to reduce emissions from electricity generation and heavy industry, like the ones already in place among the nine states in the Northeast or the California-Quebec-Ontario market. \nDon\u2019t miss: Climate change has already cost the government $35 billion \u2014 here\u2019s how much it will cost you \nThere would likely be two vehicle standards because under the Clean Air Act, California was granted a unique federal waiver to adopt stricter-than-federal vehicle policies, an acknowledgment of the state\u2019s severe smog problems. Other states have a choice\u2014follow California or stick with the federal standard. About a dozen states, representing some 40% of the U.S. population, have followed California\u2019s lead on tailpipe emissions and electric-car regulations that exceed federal standards. \nOn fuel economy, when California set a tougher standard and 14 states followed, it led to an agreement among the Obama administration, states and auto makers on stricter federal standards. In exchange, California abandoned its own rule.

The governors of California and New York recently floated the idea of linking the two existing carbon markets. \nThose who criticize states for overreaching and moving contrary to federal policy should consider that state climate initiatives seem to fit seamlessly with the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s stated goal to return power to the states under Administrator Scott Pruitt. The EPA has applied that philosophy selectively, aiming to relieve states that have a limited appetite for environmental action from federal regulations, by backing out of the Clean Power Plan, but explicitly leaving open the possibility of denying California future requests for waivers on vehicle standards. \nThen there is the criticism that states\u2019 efforts to promote renewable energy sources are far more expensive than continued reliance on nonrenewable sources for affordable, reliable power. That, too, doesn\u2019t hold water. The costs of renewables are falling spectacularly, and setting goals for their adoption will foster further innovation in battery storage technologies. The move to renewables is inevitable, and other countries have already proven they can run their power grids with far more solar and wind than the U.S. \nFinally, letting the states drive policy is the only serious option to put the U.S. back on track in the global green-tech race. \nAlso read: With climate change and sprawling property development, wildfires are here to stay \nThe U.S. is at serious risk of losing its dominant position in this multitrillion-dollar and fast-growing market.

Past challenges have included wearing a tie every day, learning to speak Mandarin and eating meat only from animals he killed himself. Last year, he visited every U.S. state he hadn't been to yet.\nThis year, though, his challenge is directed at his company rather than personal ambitions. Zuckerberg wrote Thursday that he wants to focus this year on protecting Facebook users from abuse, defending against interference by nation-states and \"making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent.\"\nIn other words, he wants to do his job as Facebook's CEO.\n\"This may not seem like a personal challenge on its face, but I think I'll learn more by focusing intensely on these issues than I would by doing something completely separate,\" Zuckerberg wrote.\nHe added that while Facebook won't prevent all mistakes or abuse, \"we currently make too many errors.\"\nFacebook had a tough 2017. It testified before Congress about Russian election meddling using its platform and drew harsh criticism from early employees and investors about its role in the world.\nBut Zuckerberg also has little choice but to fix Facebook's problems. Regulators in Washington, Europe and elsewhere are expecting concrete results. And while the platform has more than 2 billion users, there is nothing to guarantee they will stay and keep using Facebook as much as they do now if they feel depressed, lied to with fake news and hoaxes and manipulated by foreign powers.\nZuckerberg compared this year's challenge to the first one he did nine years ago. It wasn't so much about him back then either, but about the social platform he created.\n\"That first year the economy was in a deep recession and Facebook was not yet profitable. We needed to get serious about making sure Facebook had a sustainable business model. It was a serious year, and I wore a tie every day as a reminder,\" he wrote. \"Today feels a lot like that first year.\"\nBut fixing deep-rooted, existential problems is a taller order than turning a profit.\nMany of Facebook's problems are deeply rooted in how it's set up and why it's been so successful, financially and otherwise. Its secret formulas give users the content they are most likely to interact with and what's most likely to keep them coming back for more. Sometimes, that's heartfelt posts by their friends but other times it's viral fake news stories or inflammatory comments about political candidates."}

In fact, he finds that a lot of people think writing notes is below them, \"but everyone should be doing it as it can greatly improve what you do,\" he said.\nshow chapters This is why self-made millionaire Marcus Lemonis doesn\u2019t make New Year\u2019s resolutions 11:28 AM ET Sat, 30 Dec 2017 | 01:01 Branson recalled a recent time he was in South Africa speaking with the manager of one of his properties. As a result of not taking down notes during their conversation, the manager failed to take action on what he and Branson had previously discussed.\n\"If you don't write things down it's really easy to forget what was said \u2013 and often in business, it's the little things that make a big difference to your customer,\" Branson said. \"Keep a notebook in your back pocket to scribble down thoughts or feedback and make sure you follow through on them in a timely fashion.\"\nBranson said he has always made lists of things he wants to achieve as it helps him make sense of his ideas and track his progress.\nFor 2018, Branson's goal is to continue preparing for his space travels through his company Virgin Galactic, according to the post:\nGet unbelievably fit so I'm ready for a trip into space. I'll be doing lots of trekking and biking to get me into top shape. When I finished the Virgin Strive Challenge in 2016 I felt like a 25-year-old again \u2013 I hadn't felt that good in 40 years. I'll also be doing some centrifuge g-force training so I'm as acclimatized as I can be for the journey.\nWhile sharing your goals with your family and friends is helpful, Branson noted it's ultimately up to you to follow through. Another trick to making goals is to set both short-term and long-term ones so you can feel a sense of accomplishment along the way, Branson wrote.\n\"If you set daily goals and work through your list every day, you can mark off every completed task with a satisfying tick,\" Branson explained. \"This helps keep you motivated to aim for the big targets.\"\nThat \"satisfying tick\" is one way Branson recommends that you \"celebrate all the little wins,\" but more importantly, continue writing more lists after you meet your goals.\n\"No matter how big, small, simple or complex an idea is, get it in writing.

U.S. lawmakers, meanwhile, have expressed little interest in pursuing legislation to require companies to create products whose contents are accessible to authorities who obtain a warrant.\nWray's comments at the International Conference on Cyber Security were his most extensive yet as FBI director about the so-called Going Dark problem, which his agency and local law enforcement authorities for years have said bedevils countless investigations. Wray took over as FBI chief in August.\nThe FBI supports strong encryption and information security broadly, Wray said, but described the current status quo as untenable.\n\"We face an enormous and increasing number of cases that rely heavily, if not exclusively, on electronic evidence,\" Wray told an audience of FBI agents, international law enforcement representatives and private sector cyber professionals. A solution requires \"significant innovation,\" Wray said, \"but I just do not buy the claim that it is impossible.\"\nWray's remarks echoed those of his predecessor, James Comey, who before being fired by President Donald Trump in May frequently spoke about the dangers of unbreakable encryption.\nTech companies and many cyber security experts have said that any measure ensuring that law enforcement authorities are able to access data from encrypted products would weaken cyber security for everyone.\nU.S. officials have said that default encryption settings on cellphones and other devices hinder their ability to collect evidence needed to pursue criminals.\nThe matter came to a head in 2016 when the Justice Department tried unsuccessfully to force Apple Inc to break into an iPhone used by a gunman during a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.\nThe Trump administration at times has taken a tougher stance on the issue than former President Barack Obama's administration.

The stock has returned more than 2,200 percent since its 1994 initial public offering, including reinvested dividends, compared with about 650 percent for the S&P 500 Financials Index. \nCapital One, the third-biggest U.S. credit-card lender, stands to benefit along with competitors including Discover Financial Services as President Donald Trump eased financial regulations and signed legislation that cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. \n\u201cThe best is yet to come\u201d for U.S. banks, Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients last month. \u201cThere is the potential for the industry to experience higher profitability and earnings growth against a backdrop of improved economic conditions, continued strong credit quality, a more constructive regulatory environment and further increases in interest rates.\u201d \nFairbank is the fourth U.S. bank CEO to be identified as a billionaire by the Bloomberg index, joining JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s Jamie Dimon, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\u2019s Lloyd Blankfein and M&T Bancorp\u2019s Bob Wilmers, who died last month. \nShares of Capital One rose 1.9 percent this year through Thursday, to a record $101.42, fueled by a stronger economic outlook and corporate tax cuts. \nFairbank and Nigel Morris, his colleague at a Washington-area consulting firm, started tinkering with new ways of parsing data to assess credit-card risk in the 1980s. They were hired in 1988 by Signet Bank, where they pioneered concepts such as tailored interest rates and created offers that enticed borrowers to transfer balances from other cards. \nThe business prospered and Signet spun off Capital One in the 1994 IPO, making Fairbank CEO. The company, based in McLean, Virginia, is now the seventh-biggest commercial bank by assets in the U.S. The firm also targets subprime borrowers, a fee-rich business that helped Fairbank double annual profit since 2005 to $3.75 billion in 2016. \nWhile Fairbank doesn\u2019t collect a salary, over the past three years he has averaged more than $18 million in cash bonuses and stock and options awards from Capital One, according to the Bloomberg Pay Index. He declined to comment through a company spokeswoman. \nFairbank, a father of eight, is one of about a dozen minority owners of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, the group that owns five sports teams including the National Hockey League\u2019s Washington Capitals, the Washington Wizards of the National Basketball Association, as well as the Capital One Arena, where both teams play. \nCapital One has been a prolific advertiser, pouring $13 billion into marketing since 2008, featuring celebrities including Jennifer Garner, Spike Lee, Charles Barkley, Alec Baldwin and Samuel L. Jackson. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

Du Plessis was more circumspect at the other end, no doubt also reflecting on his decision to bat after winning the toss before the start of play. \nHis argument that he was going to gamble on batting because the wicket was still soft and would get quicker later in the day as it dried out, looked without substance as Kumar made full use of grass-covered track and had South Africa, who pick four seamers themselves, in early trouble. \nHe had Elgar caught behind by Wriddhiman Saha as he moved the ball away from the left-hander and then Markram leg before for five runs in the third over of the day. \nAmla (3) followed soon thereafter as he flashed at a delivery on off stump and nicked it behind to Sahara.

Apple Inc , Microsoft Corp and other software makers have issued patches to protect against the vulnerabilities.\nIntel may be on the hook for costs stemming from lawsuits claiming that the patches would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, and big customers will likely seek compensation from Intel for any software or hardware fixes they make, security experts said.\n\"The potential liability is big for Intel,\" said Eric Johnson, dean of Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management. \"Everybody will be scrambling over the next few days to figure out just how big it is.\"\nIntel has said that the patches for the bugs would slow its chips down somewhat but that most users will not notice.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), the largest seller of cloud computing services, said in a statement it does not expect meaningful performance impact for most customer workloads.\nMicrosoft and Alphabet Inc's Google both said in statements on their websites that they expect few performance problems for most of their cloud computing customers.\nBut the incident is likely to spur cloud companies to press Intel for lower prices on chips in future talks, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh, which owns shares in Intel.\nWhat (Intels cloud customers) are going to say is, You wronged us, we hate you, but if we can get a discount, well still buy from you, Forrest said.\nForrest also expects Intel will have to increase its chip development spending to focus on security.\nGovernment agencies and security experts said they knew of no cyber attacks that had exploited the vulnerabilities.\nFinancial services firms were studying information on the vulnerabilities to determine how to best respond, said the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a global industry group known as FS-ISAC that shares data on cyber threats.\nBanks and other firms are trying to understand what it will cost to respond to the issue, FS-ISAC said in an emailed statement.\n\"In addition to the security considerations raised by this design flaw, performance degradation is expected, which could require more processing power for affected systems to compensate and maintain current baseline performance, FS-ISAC said. There will need to be consideration and balance between fixing the potential security threat vs the performance and other possible impact to systems.\nLawyers filed a lawsuit in San Jose, California, federal court on Wednesday that sought class action status and compensation for people who had bought vulnerable Intel chips or computers that came with them already installed.\nIntel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday about the lawsuit.\nWhile more lawsuits are expected, Intel's biggest customers are likely to quietly seek compensation for any harm caused by the vulnerabilities, including costs to patch machines or replace microprocessors, Johnson said.\nLegal experts said that consumers would have to prove concrete damages and harm to proceed with claims.\nIntel shares fell 1.8 percent, following a 3.4 percent decline Wednesday.\nShares in rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc climbed 4.9 percent as investors speculated the No. 2 maker of microprocessors would woo customers away from Intel.\nStill, researchers had said some of AMD's chips had one of the two vulnerabilities disclosed on Wednesday, as do processors from ARM Holdings.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of German sports goods firm Puma is seen at the entrance of one of its stores in Vienna, Austria, March 18, 2016. REUTERS\/Leonhard Foeger\/File Photo \nKering, whose brands range from Gucci to Yves Saint Laurent, plans to distribute 70 percent of Puma to its own investors, retaining only a 16 percent stake in a business which is finally making strides after 10 years under its ownership. \nInvestors initially welcomed Kering\u2019s long-awaited move to shed its remaining non-luxury brands, sending its shares to record highs. They later retreated to trade down 0.5 percent. \nPuma shares fared worse, slumping at one stage by 15 percent to nine-month lows. They were down 5.5 percent in mid-day trading, and analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded their rating to \u201cunderperform\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d. \nSome investors had hoped Puma - with a 5 billion euro ($6 billion) market value, just below the price tag Kering bought it at in 2007 - might be sold at a premium and acquire another strong backer. \n\u201cThe market is disappointed as it wanted an outright Puma sale,\u201d a trader said. \nKering - controlled by France\u2019s Pinault family, which would end up with 29 percent of Puma after the spin-off through its Artemis holding - had been expected to shed the German label this year now that it is in recovery mode. \nA distant third in the global sportswear market behind Nike and local rival Adidas, Puma has refocused on popular sports such as soccer, running and motorsport after struggling for years. \nIt named singer Rihanna as creative director in 2014, seeking to tap into booming sales of women\u2019s sportswear, and recent footwear collections have done well, helping Puma increase its profit guidance three times last year. \nAn upturn in the luxury goods industry, meanwhile, underpinned by a revival of Chinese demand, has boosted Kering\u2019s fashion brands, and analysts said many of these, including Balenciaga, had strong potential. NO SALE \nKering managers said the group had preferred to avoid a drawn-out disposal of Puma to a third party, though the German firm said there had been interest from buyers. \n\u201cThere were a load of interested parties,\u201d Puma CEO Bjoern Gulden told reporters on a call on Friday. \n\u201cBut for us this is the best option.\u201d \nRothschild and boutique d\u2018Angelin advised Kering on the deal, while JP Morgan advised Puma, sources familiar with the matter said. \n\u201cA spin-off was the only way Pinault could participate in the further potential upside of Puma,\u201d a person close to the situation said, adding no formal sales process had gotten underway. \nGulden said Puma could make faster decisions as an independent company than as a subsidiary of another firm. \nThe deal will increase Puma\u2019s free-float to around 55 percent from 14 percent now, which some analysts also deemed a positive, as it makes it easier to buy and sell the shares. \n\u201cWe welcome this development, which if approved by shareholders, will increase Puma\u2019s free-float making it investable again for the first time in around 10 years. At the same time, Kering will be now able to focus purely on its luxury goods business, where we continue to see value,\u201d analysts at brokerage Berenberg wrote in a note. \nKering rivals larger groups such as France\u2019s LVMH ( LVMH.PA ), owner of Louis Vuitton, though until recently it traded at a discount to luxury peers in terms of forward earnings (see graphic). A stellar performance at Gucci has helped it catch up. \nKering had already rid itself of retail assets such as CD and book business Fnac and online retailer La Redoute. \nIts skatewear label Volcom, acquired in 2011 for $608 million, will now also likely be on the block. \n(Graphic for Jan 12 Kering versus competitors valuations, click reut.rs\/2Dp5Kgf ) Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Sarah White in Paris, Emma Thomasson in Berlin, Helen Reid in London and Arno Schuetze in Frankfurt; Additional reporting by Thyagaraju Adinarayan; Editing by Keith Weir and Mark Potter"}

The White House emerged from that conversation believing it had an agreement to limit the questioning of Bannon just to events during the campaign, and not during the transition period or his time in the White House. \nThen, hours into Bannon's closed-door testimony on Tuesday, Bannon's lawyers informed the White House from Capitol Hill that the questions would extend beyond the scope of what the White House understood the agreement to be. At that point, the White House told Bannon not to answer any further. \n\"We said 'Hey, hey, pump the brakes,'\" the official said Wednesday. \"We said to Bannon, 'Don't answer those questions because we haven't agreed to that scope under the process.'\" \nThe committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff, said the White House did not inform him or his fellow party members on the panel about such an agreement. \n\"That was never conveyed to the minority,\" Schiff said Tuesday night. \"And I think it came as quite a surprise to our entire committee frankly, apart from the majority staffer that was involved in that communication.\" show chapters 3 Hours Ago | 03:25 \nThe Trump administration official declined to say who initiated the mid-testimony phone call or who took part on behalf of the White House. \nAt that point, House Intelligence Committee Republicans and Democrats joined forces to issue Bannon a subpoena on the spot to compel his testimony. It is not clear what, if any, questions Bannon answered after that. A Reuters report said the former top Trump aide refused to comply with the subpoena . \nBannon did not comment substantively Tuesday evening as he left Capitol Hill. \nThe House Intelligence Committee didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC. \nDespite the attempt to limit questioning of Bannon, the White House official insisted the administration is not asserting executive privilege. \"We're not asserting anything,\" the official said. \"They need to discuss it with us. There's a process that's existed for decades.\" \nThe official would not say what the White House wants to discuss with the committee or what questions about Bannon's time on the transition or in the White House the administration would seek to block. \nStill, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders used the phrase \"executive privileges\" when asked Tuesday whether the White House was blocking Bannon from testifying fully. \n\"Look, we've been completely cooperative throughout this entire process,\" Sanders said. \"We're going to continue to be cooperative. But we're also going to maintain some of the executive privileges here at the White House.\" \nIn essence, the White House is hoping to reap many of the benefits of executive privilege, without President Donald Trump officially asserting the privilege. Formally asserting executive privilege could be embarrassing for the White House, which has insisted it has nothing to hide in the ongoing Russia investigation and that it is cooperating fully. \nRep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., one of the Republicans leading the committee's investigation, reacted with exasperation to Bannon and the White House's claims. \n\"It is the most tortured analysis of executive privilege I have ever heard of,\" Gowdy said on Fox News. \"Executive privilege now covers things before you become the chief executive \u2014 which is just mind-numbing and there is no legal support for it.\" \nDemocrats were also frustrated with the 10-hour Bannon meeting. \n\"This was effectively a gag order by the White House preventing this witness from answering almost any question concerning his time in the transition or the administration and many questions even after he left the administration,\" said Schiff, D-Calif. \nThe committee had earlier rebuffed a White House offer Friday to have a White House attorney sit in on the Bannon session to referee the questions surrounding scope of the interview. \"The committee's belief was it was not necessary,\" the official said. \nAsked if negotiations over Bannon's testimony are ongoing as of Wednesday morning, the White House official said: \"There's no negotiation now, they haven't engaged with us.\" \nBut committee members say they still want to hear from Bannon. \n\"We have additional questions,\" said Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas. \"The subpoena remains in effect. And we have additional questions we don't have the answers to yet. We're going to work to get those answers.\" show chapters"}

He comes to the position amid a critical time for the Fed, which is normalizing policy after years of extraordinary accommodation triggered by the financial crisis. \nThough he was confirmed Tuesday, he likely won't officially assume his duties until Janet Yellen' s term expires in February. Yellen has said she will leave the Fed after Powell is sworn in, though her term does not expire until Jan. 31, 2024. \nWhere Fed chairmen tend to be economists, Powell comes to his position with a more markets-based background, particularly in venture capital. Previous stints included time at the Carlyle Group, Severn Capital Partners and the Global Environmental Fund. \nIn addition, he spent time at the Treasury Department and most recently, before coming to the Fed in 2012, served as a visiting scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank.

In addition, central bank officials have indicated that three more increases likely are on the way in 2018, a view the market recently has adapted as well. \nAlong with the rate hikes comes a reduction in the Fed's balance sheet \u2014 a $4.5 trillion portfolio of mostly Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, the great majority of which were acquired in three rounds of bond buying called quantitative easing . The Fed embarked on the program in an effort to pull down borrowing rates and, indirectly or not, drive investors into riskier assets like stocks and corporate bonds. \nThe Fed currently is allowing a capped level of proceeds from the bonds to run off each month, with a top level of $50 billion in a year. Some market participants have speculated that if inflation starts running hotter that a Powell Fed might get more aggressive with the balance sheet reduction. \nPowell's term runs for four years.

New Way to Pay \nThe company\u2019s effectiveness-based discount is sharply different from how most drugs are currently sold. Health insurers are also used to paying for medicine over the course of a disease or over a patient\u2019s life, in the case of some chronic conditions. \nA one-time treatment presented a challenge, since the cost would be paid for by one insurer or government, only to have others reap the benefits when the patient changes coverage. \nTo help mitigate that dynamic, Spark is rolling out several programs to spread out the cost over the years or give rebates to payers if the benefits wane with time. \nFor example, the company said it\u2019s discussing a program with the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that would spread payments for Luxturna over several years, even though the therapy would be given only once. It didn\u2019t say how many installments would be made, or how long it would take to pay the full cost of the drug. \nIn an agreement with the Boston-area insurer Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Spark will get the full price of treatment up front. If patients don\u2019t get an immediate benefit \u2014 measured at 30 days, or a long term one \u2014 measured at 30 months, Spark will have to give some of the money back in a rebate. \nSpark has also proposed selling the gene therapy directly to insurance companies or specialty pharmacies. That would sidestep the current process that requires hospitals or health care providers to buy expensive therapies upfront. Spark is working with Express Scripts Holding Co. on such an arrangement, and said it\u2019s talking with other drug plans. \u2018Revolutionary Product\u2019 \nExpress Scripts has been a frequent critic of costly drugs, yet said that the Spark treatment is an exception. \n\u201cMany people were anticipating this would be more than a million dollars\u201d said Steve Miller, the St. Louis-based company\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cIn the end, this is a revolutionary product, and I think in most plans this will be covered.\u201d \nSpark\u2019s biggest challenge may be finding patients to treat. \nOf the few thousand people with the disease, only a few have actually been tested and confirmed to have it, since there was no cure, and thus little use in diagnosis. Many with more advanced forms of the disease won\u2019t qualify for treatment, according to the company. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

Proceeds are earmarked for the purchase of equipment for a $300 million yuan cement plant in Laos with an expected daily capacity of 5,000 tons.\nThe new Belt and Road bond category has the blessing of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the regulator of the exchange-traded bond market, and the Shanghai bourse was quick to tout the achievement as a sign of its support for President Xi Jinping's signature economic initiative.\nMarket participants, however, were less impressed.\n\"It is just a new label under the CSRC,\" said a source close to Hongshi's deal. \"It does not seem to bring pricing benefit for issuers and it doesn't guarantee that the proceeds can be used offshore.\"\nHongshi, rated AAA by China Chengxin, priced the three-year notes at par to yield 6.34%. The offering was 2.67 times covered, according to a press release from the SSE.\nAfter multiple self-labelled BRI and Silk Road bonds from Chinese banks and corporate issuers, both offshore and onshore, in the past few years, the official label suggests that China's regulators are seeking more control over the use of the term.\nThe National Development and Reform Commission, the country's main economic planner, said last year it would provide better guidelines to curb risks associated with the infrastructure programme.\nHongshi's Laos project is listed as a key Belt and Road initiative by the NDRC in Zhejiang Province, where Hongshi is based, according to the bond prospectus.\nPolitical game Market participants said the new BRI bond category seemed like an attempt to show the CSRC's support for the government initiative, but that the format was unlikely to become mainstream because of restrictions on cross-border capital flows.\n\"We don't feel BRI bonds will go big as offshore use of the proceeds remains an issue,\" said another Shenzhen-based syndicate banker.\nHowever, bankers said the BRI label would speed up approvals from CSRC.\nSSE highlighted Hongshi's issue in the press release as another example of the bourse's active promotion of the role of capital markets in funding projects related to China's massive Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\nIn March last year, Russian aluminium producer UC Rusal privately placed $1 billion yuan of three-year non-call two notes on the SSE. It was the first bond offering at the exchange from one of the countries touched by the Belt and Road initiative, SSE said.\nShenzhen Stock Exchange, the other domestic bourse under the CSRC's supervision, is also set to embrace its first BRI bonds.\nLast month, Asia's biggest warehouse operator, Global Logistic Properties (GLP), announced that it had obtained approval from the CSRC to issue up to $12 billion yuan of Belt and Road corporate bonds in Shenzhen.\nProceeds would be used to repay debt linked to GLP's recent acquisition of logistics assets in Europe, it said.\nThe National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors, the main regulator of corporate bonds in the far larger interbank bond market, has yet to create a similar category.\nHowever, NAFMII earlier announced Panda bond offerings from issuers including China Merchants Group and GLP as supportive of Belt and Road projects.\n\"Hongshi is already a frequent issuer in the interbank bond market, but we did not put the Belt and Road label on its previous deals,\" said a source familiar with Hongshi's offerings in the interbank bond market. \"We were told not to overuse the term 'Belt and Road'.\"\nGuotai Junan Securities was sole lead underwriter on Hongshi's offering."}

His spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment. \nNoor, a former commander in the anti-Soviet Mujahiddin considered one of the richest men in Afghanistan, has faced repeated accusations of corruption, which he denies. In 2015 Human Rights Watch said there was \u201cstrong evidence that he controls and funds local militias implicated in serious abuse\u201d. \nBut Balkh, which sits on vital trade routes into central Asia, is also one of Afghanistan\u2019s most stable and prosperous provinces, with a much smaller Taliban and Islamic State presence than in other northern regions. \nNoor enjoys strong support, notably from a business community that has done well out of the lucrative transit trade through Hairatan, the border crossing into Uzbekistan that handles hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods a year. \n\u201cPeople have been very unhappy about the problems between the president and the governor,\u201d said Khairuddin Mayel, who runs a large cooking oil and foods business. \u201cThe governor has been very successful and people don\u2019t want this province to become like the others. They do not want to lose this governor.\u201d DISPUTED ELECTION Atta Mohammad Noor, Governor of the Balkh province, poses for a photo before an interview in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan January 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Anil Usyan \nAs the stand-off in Balkh has continued it has become a national issue, with Noor now demanding wider concessions, including what Jamiat sees as proper implementation of the accord underpinning Ghani\u2019s national unity government. \nLike many of the political problems of the past three years, the crisis stems from the fraud-marred presidential election in 2014 that left no agreed winner. \nUnder a U.S.-brokered deal, Ghani, an ethnic Pashtun, was appointed president while his rival Abdullah Abdullah, from Jamiat, was given the specially created post of chief executive. \nEver since, Jamiat supporters have bitterly resented what they see as Ghani\u2019s betrayal of the deal and favoritism toward Pashtuns, traditionally the strongest group in Afghan politics. Atta Mohammad Noor, Governor of the Balkh province, poses for a photo before an interview in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan January 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Anil Usyan \nWhile Noor has been angry with Ghani, he has also been incensed by Abdullah, his long-time party rival, whom he describes as a \u201csnake\u201d. \n\u201cJamiat will never trust Dr Abdullah,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has shown he is weak and a partner in the incompetence and crimes of the government.\u201d \nAbdullah has confirmed he had approved the decision to oust the governor, but has had little to say about Noor\u2019s reaction. \nThe dispute has also highlighted the role of a clutch of regional leaders, of whom Noor is one of the most prominent, whose strong local support have made them difficult for the central government to control. \nOver recent months, Ghani has sidelined several of them, forcing ethnic Uzbek vice-President Rashid Dostum into exile following a torture scandal. \nHe has also clashed with General Abdul Raziq, a powerful police commander whose successes against the Taliban in the southern province of Kandahar have given him a growing national profile. \nIn June, Noor joined Dostum, currently in Turkey, in forming a \u201cCoalition for the Salvation of Afghanistan\u201d, uniting figures from the Tajik, Hazara and Uzbek communities. Pictures of the two, together with Hazara leader Mohammad Mohaqiq, are on prominent display in Mazar. \nNoor said they, and other regional leaders, represented a reality that could not be ignored. \n\u201cWe have powerful political parties, influential figures, those who have grassroots support among the people,\u201d said Noor. \u201cThey will remain in Afghanistan and will fight against terrorism as they fought in the past.\u201d Additional reporting by Mirwais Harooni in KABUL; Editing by Alex Richardson"}

The release of the contaminants can cause pipelines to corrode and leach lead into drinking water, while zinc and copper can be leached from rocks and soil in streams. The study found that a combination of salts can do more damage than one salt alone. \n\u201cUntil now we didn\u2019t fully appreciate the role that different salts play in altering the pH of streams and rivers of our country,\u201d said Sujay Kaushal, a University of Maryland geologist and the lead scientist of the study, published in the early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study also looked at waterways in southern Canada. \nIncreased alkalization of waterways, which Kaushal calls \u201crivers on Rolaids,\u201d was a factor in the lead poisoning crisis in Detroit, in which children were found with high levels of the heavy metal that harms nervous systems in their blood. \nThe study found that 66 percent of stream and river sites have become more alkaline over the last 50 years. Alkaline water can also cause excessive scaling on the insides of water pipes. Some scaling is desirable as it protects metals from leaching from the pipe, but too much can constrict or block pipes. \nWater treatment centers cannot filter out salts, but they use chemicals to fight them. The trouble is that floods and snowstorms are episodic, so it can be hard for the centers to determine the correct amount of additives to use, Kaushal said. Using brine instead of granulated salt for de-icing roads and pre-salting roads ahead of snowstorms can reduce the amount of salt used, he said.

There are indications that he is preparing to haul in the president for an interview.There remains, however, a crucial hole in the case for collusion \u2014 at least, the part of it known to the public. We have not seen or heard any evidence that President Trump personally participated in some kind of illegal election hacking scheme in coordination with Russian agents.\nMore from Vox\nNorth Korea has agreed to send athletes to the Olympics in a rare diplomatic breakthrough\nNewly released Senate testimony debunks a key conservative theory on Trump and Russia\nTrump, the anti-globalist, will attend the world's most globalist conference\nBut there's another kind of case against the president \u2014 the argument that his various attempts to undermine the Russia investigation, like firing FBI Director James Comey, constitute criminal obstruction of justice. If Mueller feels he has enough evidence, then he could seek permission to indict and prosecute Trump. It's not clear that charges can actually be brought against a sitting president, but Mueller's findings could nevertheless be turned over to Congress \u2014 and serve as the centerpiece of any impeachment proceedings against Trump.\nThat means it's obstruction, not collusion, that poses the biggest legal and political threat to President Trump.\n\"If Trump exercises his power \u2014 even his lawful power \u2014 with a corrupt motive of interfering with an investigation, that's obstruction,\" says Lisa Kern Griffin, an expert on criminal law at Duke University. \"The attempt is sufficient, and it seems to be a matter of public record already.\"\nThere are basically two reasons Griffin and other legal observers believe Mueller has such a good case obstruction case. First, the evidence of obstruction is, from what we know publicly, far stronger than the evidence that Trump himself was involved in with Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. Second, the crime of obstruction is legally straightforward, whereas it's not obvious which laws Trump would have violated by accepting Russian assistance during the election.\nThe public, obviously, doesn't know everything Mueller does. It could be that the collusion case is a lot clearer, or the obstruction case a lot murkier, than it appears from the outside.\nBut what we do know suggests that Mueller is taking the obstruction charge seriously, and that his chances of making his case are quite good \u2014 unless Trump decides to fire him or his boss.\nThe evidence that Trump obstructed justice seems stronger than the evidence of collusion We know for a fact that Mueller is looking into potential obstruction charges.\nOn January 4, the New York Times 's Michael Schmidt reported that Trump ordered the White House counsel, Don McGahn, to convince Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. When McGahn failed, \"the president erupted in anger in front of numerous White House officials, saying he needed his attorney general to protect him,\" Schmidt writes. \"Mr. Trump said he had expected his top law enforcement official to safeguard him.\"\nThe incident suggests that the president wanted law enforcement officials to protect him from criminal charges. And indeed, Schmidt reports that the episode was initially discovered by Mueller \"as he investigates whether Mr. Trump obstructed the F.B.I.'s Russia inquiry.\"\nThe irony, according to many experts, is that this kind of effort to block the Russia investigation has likely created a bigger legal problem for Trump than anything he may have done with Russians.\n\"So-called 'offenses against the administration of justice' \u2014 like obstruction of justice or lying to the FBI \u2014 are often easier to prove than the underlying criminality that the subject was trying to hide,\" says Jens David Ohlin, a professor of law at Cornell. \"In Trump's case, this is undoubtedly true.\"\nThere's clear evidence that some of Trump's campaign staff were in contact with Russian officials, and even interested in receiving their help in the election. The best example is the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, where Donald Trump Jr. met with a Kremlin-linked attorney who was promising to provide dirt from the Russian government on Hillary Clinton.\nBut to link Trump himself to collusion, you'd need to prove that he had personally approved of this meeting, or that the Trump campaign as a whole was involved in a broader plot to work with the Russian government. In the absence of this evidence, experts say it would be very hard to charge the president with any kind of collusion-related crime. And no such evidence exists, at least in the public record.\n\"Nothing, to my knowledge, has come out that implicated [Trump] directly,\" says Asha Rangappa, a former FBI special agent and current associate dean of Yale University.\nThe public evidence that Trump committed obstruction of justice \u2014 defined as \"corruptly\" attempting to \"influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice\" \u2014 is quite a bit stronger, particularly when it comes to the Comey firing.\nTechnically, the FBI director serves at the pleasure of the president and can be fired at any time and for any reason. However, the general belief among experts is that it's not legal for the president to use this power in an attempt to shield himself or his family members from criminal investigation. Crucially, it does not matter whether Trump successfully shielded himself from scrutiny \u2014 all that matters is that he tried to.\n\"The obstruction statutes are very broad,\" Griffin explains. \"It matters whether Trump 'endeavors' to impede the DOJ and congressional investigations at any turn.\"\nThis all hinges on what was in the president's mind when he fired Comey. If Trump did it because he thought Comey was doing a poor job supervising the Russia investigation, that's perfectly legal. If he did it because he was worried that Comey's investigation might end up uncovering some kind of misdeeds by the Trump family \u2014 whether Russia-related, financial, or otherwise \u2014 then that's obstruction.\nTypically, proving intent is difficult for prosecutors, because establishing what a person was thinking at a particular moment is inherently challenging. But Trump has made things easier for Mueller \u2014 by repeatedly, even publicly, admitting that he fired Comey out of hostility to the Russia investigation.\nThere's an interview with NBC's Lester Holt in which Trump admits to removing the FBI chief because he felt \"this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.\" There was Trump's meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov the day after the firing, where he told the foreign diplomat that \"I faced great pressure because of Russia [and now] that's taken off.\" And then there are his endless tweets about how he thinks the Russia investigation is a \"witch hunt\" and should be shut down.\n\"He's kind of making the case himself for Mueller [on] obstruction,\" Rangappa concludes.\nFiring Comey isn't the only possible Trump action that could land him in hot water on obstruction charges.

In early trading WTI hit $60.74, the highest since June 2015. \nBrent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark, were down 53 cents, or 0.8 percent at $66.34 a barrel. The session high of $67.29 was the highest since May 2015. \nThe spread between U.S. crude and Brent WTCLc1-LCoc1 hit the narrowest in nearly two weeks. \nThe 450,000 barrel per day (bpd) capacity Forties pipeline system in the North Sea returned to full operations on Dec. 30 after an unplanned shutdown. \nRepairs have been finished on a Libyan oil pipeline damaged in a suspected attack last week and production is restarting gradually, engineers said. \n\u201cThe resolution of the North Sea pipeline issue is having the expected result that the Brent-WTI spread is narrowing today,\u201d David Thompson, executive vice-president at Powerhouse, an energy-specialized commodities broker in Washington. \nThompson added that traders have been returning to work from the holidays, boosting volumes. \n\u201cDespite the day\u2019s price weakness, both Brent and WTI remain in solid, long-term bullish trends - $58.95 is nearby support on WTI front-month futures and $65.60 is the corresponding support on front-month Brent futures,\u201d Thompson said. \nIran\u2019s Supreme Leader on Tuesday accused the country\u2019s enemies of stirring unrest, as the death toll rose to 21 from anti-government demonstrations that began last week.[nL8N1OX0XY] FILE PHOTO: A view shows the French oil giant Total refinery in Donges, France, November 21, 2017. REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe \nIran is OPEC\u2019s third largest crude producer. Iranian oil industry and shipping sources said protests have had no impact so far on oil production or exports. \n\u201cGeopolitical risks are clearly back on the crude oil agenda after having been absent almost entirely since the oil market ran into a surplus in the second half of 2014,\u201d Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, said, also citing Kurdistan and Libya. \nOil markets have been supported by a year of production cuts led by the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The cuts started in January 2017 and are scheduled to cover all of 2018. \nU.S. commercial crude oil inventories have fallen by almost 20 percent from their historic highs last March, to 431.9 million barrels. \nStrong demand growth, especially from China, has also been supporting crude. \nHowever, rising U.S. production, which is on the verge of breaking through 10 million bpd, has tempered the bullish outlook. \n\u201cWe think U.S. tight oil production growth warrants close monitoring as it could spoil OPEC\u2019s market-balancing efforts, pushing the market into surplus in 2018,\u201d Barclays bank said. \nOctober U.S crude production rose 167,000 barrels per day to 9.64 million bpd, according to the EIA\u2019s monthly production report. If the figure is not revised next month, it would be the highest monthly level since May 1971. \nFor a graphic on Oil price January opening values, click: reut.rs\/2C8eeGP \nFor a graphic on U.S. oil production, drilling and storage levels, click: reut.rs\/2C706hj Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore; editing by David Evans and David Gregorio"}

Services is Apple\u2019s fastest growing business, outpacing revenue growth in key products like iPhones and iPads. Apple has said it aims to double its services revenue from $24 billion in its 2016 fiscal year to $48 billion by 2020. \nPerhaps more important, the new spending could make room for Apple to spend less money on other companies\u2019 cloud services. Apple has relied on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure to meet its computing needs, despite that it competes with those companies in certain areas. \nApple did not explicitly say it aims to reduce spending on third-party cloud providers, and declined comment on that aspect of Wednesday\u2019s news. But Apple has explored that area in past years. \n\u201cOver $10 billion of Apple\u2019s expanded capital expenditures will be investments in data centers across the U.S.,\u201d Apple said in a statement on Wednesday. \nThe word \u201cexpanded\u201d shows the $10 billion will be on top of Apple\u2019s existing data center spending. In November Apple said it would spend about $16 billion in capital expenditures, including spending on data centers, in 2018. That number shows a roughly 7.5 percent increase year over year. It\u2019s not clear what percentage of Apple\u2019s capital expenditures in a given year go toward data centers. \nApple has also been spending money to set up new data centers in Europe, and last year the company announced plans to build its first data center in China in partnership with a Chinese company. \nBy way of comparison, Microsoft had $10.2 billion in capital expenditures in its 2017 fiscal year (which ended June 30, 2017), up nearly 15 percent. \nIn 2016 Alphabet\u2019 s Google business, which includes its public cloud, had $9.4 billion in capital expenditures, representing 6 percent growth. \nAmazon, whose Amazon Web Services segment leads the public cloud market, had cash capital expenditures totaling $6.7 billion in 2017, up 45 percent."}

Under the managed distribution plan, a Fund issues a notice to shareholders and a press release containing information about the amount and sources of the distribution and other related information on payment date of the distribution. A Fund's distributions in any period may be more or less than the net return earned by the Fund on its investments, and therefore should not be used as a measure of performance or confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\" Distributions in excess of Fund returns will cause its net asset value to erode. Investors should not draw any conclusions about a Fund's investment performance from the amount of its distribution or from the terms of its managed distribution plan. The Fund's Board may amend or terminate the managed distribution plan at any time without prior notice to Fund shareholders.\nThe Distribution Rate at Market Price is based on the Fund's most recent regular distribution per share (annualized) divided by the Fund's market price at the end of the period. Fund distributions may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in Fund performance, the cost of financing for Funds that employ leverage, portfolio holdings, realized and projected returns, and other factors. There can be no assurance that an unanticipated change in market conditions or other unforeseen factors will not result in a change in a Fund's distributions at a future time.\nA portion of the distributions may be comprised of amounts from sources other than net investment income. If that is the case, you will be notified in writing. Further information will be available prior to the payment date at funds.eatonvance.com . The final determination of tax characteristics of each Fund's distributions will occur after the end of the year, at which time it will be reported to the shareholders.\nThe Funds are managed by Eaton Vance Management, a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp. (NYSE: EV) which is a leading global asset manager whose history dates to 1924. With offices in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia, Eaton Vance and its affiliates managed $422.3 billion in assets as of October 31, 2017, offering individuals and institutions a broad array of investment strategies and wealth management solutions. For more information, visit eatonvance.com .\nShares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The market price of Fund shares may vary from net asset value based on factors affecting the supply and demand for shares, such as Fund distribution rates relative to similar investments, investors' expectations for future distribution changes, the clarity of the Fund's investment strategy and future return expectations, and investors' confidence in the underlying markets in which the Fund invests. Fund shares are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of principal invested. No Fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a Fund. An investment in a Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

(AP) \u2014 Coal mining deaths surged in the U.S. in 2017, one year after they hit a record low.\nThe nation's coal mines recorded 15 deaths last year, including eight in West Virginia. Kentucky had two deaths, and there were one each in Alabama, Colorado, Montana, Pennsylvania and Wyoming. In 2016 there were eight U.S. coal mine deaths.\nWest Virginia has led the nation in coal mining deaths in six of the past eight years. That includes 2010, when 29 miners were killed in an explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine in southern West Virginia.\nIn September,   appointed retired coal company executive David Zatezalo as the new chief of the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Most of the deaths this year occurred before his appointment. The Wheeling resident retired in 2014 as chairman of Rhino Resources.\nZatezalo was narrowly approved by the Senate in November. His appointment was opposed by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who said he was not convinced Zatezalo was suited to oversee the federal agency that implements and enforces mine safety laws and standards.\nTrump repeatedly voiced support for the coal industry during his presidential campaign. The increasing reliance on natural gas and other less expensive sources of energy has prompted coal use to diminish.\nLast month   brought up for review standards implemented by Barack Obama's administration that lowered the allowable limits for miners' exposure to coal dust. MSHA indicated it is reconsidering rules meant to protect underground miners from breathing coal and rock dust \u2014 the cause of black lung \u2014 and diesel exhaust, which can cause cancer.\nEight coal mining deaths this year involved hauling vehicles and two others involved machinery. None were attributed to an explosion of gas or dust, which was to blame for the Upper Big Branch disaster.\nAccording to MSHA data, seven of the eight U.S. coal mining fatalities in the first half of 2017 involved miners with one year or less experience at the mine, and six involved miners with one year or less experience on the job. In June, MSHA announced an initiative focusing on less experienced miners, including improved mine operators' training programs.\nThe number of coal mining fatalities was under 20 for the fourth straight year after reaching exactly 20 in 2011, 2012 and 2013. By comparison, in 1966, the mining industry counted 233 deaths. A century ago there were 2,226.\nMSHA has attributed low numbers in previous years to far fewer coal mining jobs and tougher enforcement of mining safety rules. Zatezalo has said his first priority was preventing people from getting hurt.\n\"President Trump is strongly committed to the health and safety of America's miners,\" Zatezalo said in a statement Tuesday. \"At MSHA, our focus is on ensuring that every miner is able to return safely to their loved ones at the end of every shift. To ensure the health and safety of miners, MSHA will continue to vigorously emphasize safety enforcement, technology, education and training, and compliance and technical assistance.\"\nThere have been a record-low 13 fatalities in 2017 in non-coal mines that produce gravel, sand, limestone and mineable metals. There also were 17 such deaths in 2015 and 30 in 2014.\nAppalachia has been especially hit hard by the closing of dozens of mines in recent years, but there was a turnaround in production in 2017.\nAccording to the Energy Information Administration's weekly estimates, U.S. coal production increased 8.9 percent in the 52 weeks ending Dec. 23, the latest available. Production in West Virginia increased 16 percent, including 25 percent in coal-rich southern West Virginia. Wyoming, the top coal-producing state, saw a 10.7 percent increase.\nThere were about 92,000 working miners in the United States in 2011, compared with about 52,000 in 2016, the lowest figure since the Energy Information Administration began collecting data in 1978. The 2017 numbers are not yet available."}

By mid-January, Pres. Trump must decide whether to punish exporters of cheap steel and aluminum that threaten American producers, the subject of a nine-month national security investigation. By late January, Pres. Trump must decide whether to levy fines on Chinese solar panel producers. A decision on washing machine tariffs is due early February.\nA separate, draft report is circulating among agencies on Chinese violations of US intellectual property \u2014 an issue that figured prominently in the National Security Strategy \u2014 is said to contain \"muscular\" recommendations. An administration official tells CNBC the recommendations are still being discussed, but could be made public this month.\nStrict enforcement actions against China and unpredictable negotiations on free-trade agreements may align with President Trump's populist preferences on trade, but the business community and Republican lawmakers have warned of the economic consequences of letting the pendulum swing too far.\n\"To date, the Trump Presidency has been marked by strong growth and job creation and rising business confidence. Withdrawing from trade agreements or raising tariffs puts that momentum at risk,\" said John Murphy, senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \"The White House has a choice here: Take aggressive action on longstanding trade concerns or double down on economic growth.\"\nA White House official pointed to trade as part of a \"bigger picture\" for the economy, with cabinet-level discussions described as \"deliberative\" and the President focused on doing right by American workers.\nBut as the White House considers its choices, battle lines have been forming on two fronts.\nThe first is between congressional Republicans who support free trade and the hawks advising the President to withdraw from multilateral trade agreements and instill tariffs. Such advisers had been pushing Trump to take action against China on steel or intellectual property before his November trip to Asia. Citing tax reform sensitivity, diplomatic efforts and national security, centrist aides moved to postpone any potential action, sources familiar with the matter said.\nThe White House moved to shelve its most rancorous trade rhetoric toward the end of the year in an effort to preserve GOP relationships as tax reform neared passage. Expecting the truce would be temporary, GOP senators and governors began seeking reassurances in December from the Administration that it would not withdraw from NAFTA as talks enter their final stretch in early 2018.\n\" The Montreal round has become make or break,\" said Matt McAlvanah, principal at Monument Policy Group and former Assistant U.S Trade Representative. \"If there is little or no progress made in Montreal it's hard to see how a deal comes together by the administration's March deadline.\"\nWithdrawal is not an outcome that fazes Amb. Robert Lighthizer, the top US trade official; at a briefing with reporters following the October round, Lighthizer said, \"If we end up not having an agreement, my guess is all three countries will do just fine.\"\nRebecca Cook | Reuters A semi truck headed for Windsor, Ontario, drives onto the Ambassador bridge in Detroit, Michigan. At a White House meeting on Dec. 5, a heated exchange took place between Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Lighthizer, the top US trade official. Alexander, who had been defending NAFTA's positive impact on the automotive industry, challenged Lighthizer to name a senator who would support withdrawing from the pact. Lighthizer, according to a person briefed on the meeting, could not.\nA White House official said it would be premature to discuss whether the U.S. would initiate withdrawal talks when the three countries convene this month, and a second official said there are \"notional\" dates being discussed for future talks in February and March.\nIn charting his trade agenda, Pres. Trump must also balance the interests of two industries with heavy presence in states that voted for him: Manufacturing and agriculture.\nPrivate sector advisory reports have shown manufacturers and labor unions in support of the strict approach the Administration has taken in its talks with NAFTA partners and Korea. And one specific NAFTA proposal that so far hasn't sit well with Mexico and Canada - requiring automobiles to have 50 percent of parts come from the US - is a direct overture to US factory workers.\nYet in recent months, the agricultural community has warned that such proposals, met with resistance by Mexico and Canada, could put a deal \u2014 and their business \u2014 at risk.\nJeff Schwager employs 530 people at Sartori Company, which exports cheese to 50 countries. He says withdrawing from NAFTA would erase half his business in Mexico and Canada, and cut revenues by at least 2 percent overall.\n\"Canada and Mexico are both excellent trading partners, and if we can't work with the countries that are so close to us, it makes it even harder for the ones that are farther away,\" Schwager tells CNBC.\nKent Bacus of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association says it's hard to brace for impact without knowing what the US will do.\n\"I don't know how you have a plan B to lose a billion dollar market, and that's really something that's concerning us,\" Bacus told CNBC. \"We stand to lose more than we stand to gain.\"\nThe industry chasm exists on the China front, too.\nAmerican steel and aluminum producers would cheer tariffs on Chinese exporters after years of watching prices get suppressed due to oversupply. But Nicholas Lardy of Peterson Institute for International Economics says China could target US agriculture in retaliation. Roughly 40% of the US soybean crop, concentrated in farm belt states like Indiana, Wisconsin and Iowa, is exported to China.\n\"If we lose that market, the price will plummet,\" Lardy said.\nPresident Trump will speak to the Farm Bureau convention on Jan. 8, an address that may hold some tea leaves for how he plans to approach this month's slate of decisions.\nTRADE DEADLINES LOOMING January 5: Talks resume with Korea to modernize trade deal January 14\/15: \u2013 Deadline for Commerce Dept. recommendations on whether steel imports threaten US national security January 21\/22: Deadline for Commerce Dept. recommendations on whether aluminum imports threaten U.S. national security.

May\u2019s invitation for Trump to visit the Queen has faced growing opposition, fueled in part by the president\u2019s Twitter criticism of London Mayor Sadiq Khan and retweets of propaganda from a far-right British anti-Muslim group. \nRead: President Trump Said He\u2019d Prefer Immigrants From Norway Over \u2018Shithole Countries\u2019 \nKhan said Trump \u201cwould without doubt have been met by mass peaceful protests\u201d if he hadn\u2019t canceled the trip. \u201cIt appears that President Trump got the message.\u201d \nBritish opposition politicians said Trump was not welcome in the U.K. Former opposition Labour party leader leader Ed Miliband tweeted to Trump that the reason he cancelled was really \u201cbecause nobody wanted you to come. And you got the message.\u201d Wedding Snub \nFarage, who was the first British politician to meet Trump after his election victory, suggested political opposition to Trump\u2019s views may have played a part. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing,\u201d Farage told BBC Radio\u2019s Today program on Friday. It\u2019s possible that plans for \u201cmass protests, those optics he didn\u2019t like the look of.\u201d \nAnother explanation could be reports that Trump isn\u2019t happy because he may not be invited to the forthcoming wedding of British royal Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The prince is on friendly terms with former President Barack Obama, who U.K. media have suggested will be invited. \n\u201cWho his Royal Highness Prince Harry and Miss Markle invite to their wedding is really a matter for them,\u201d said senior Conservative Party lawmaker Tom Tugendhat. Foreign heads of state should not automatically expect an invitation to the wedding, he added. \nRead: Carrier Factory \u2018Saved\u2019 By Donald Trump to Lay Off 200 More Workers \nTrump\u2019s decision to stay away from the embassy opening is \u201ca great shame\u201d but will not cause lasting harm to the transatlantic relationship, Tugendhat told the Today program. \u201cThe United States is very much one of our closest allies but the alliance isn\u2019t based on who lives in the White House and who lives in Number 10, it\u2019s based on shared values, common interests and an absolute commitment to the international rules-based system.\u201d \nThe new site on the south bank of the river Thames near to the Palace of Westminster had been scheduled to open during Obama\u2019s term, but delays pushed back its formal opening until this year. The State Department agreed to sell the existing embassy building on Grosvenor Square, Mayfair, to Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Co. in 2009 to fund the relocation. The investors have sought approval to turn the building into a hotel, according to the project\u2019s website. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

The overhaul of financial rules bundled in the European Union\u2019s MiFID II directive is designed to make finance fairer and safer. But that laudable aim comes at a heavy cost, with an unrealistic deadline, and may open up new regulatory loopholes.\nThe latest iteration of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which comes into force on Wednesday, touches most aspects of European financial markets. Banks will have to make sure customers are sold the right products and charge them directly for services like research that were previously bundled into trading costs. Fund managers will have to make sure they get the best prices, and more trading will happen on transparent platforms.\nThe result should be more competition and better prices \u2013 ultimately leading to cheaper capital for companies. Such desirable aims come with a hefty up-front bill, though. Opimas, a consultancy, reckons banks, brokers and asset managers will spend 2.5 billion euros getting ready for MiFID II, and over 700 million euros a year after that coping with new rules. Most of that burden will fall on banks.\nThere are indirect costs, too. Forcing banks and brokers to charge customers directly for research is likely to shrink the amount of financial analysis conducted by banks. That may impair price discovery, particularly for smaller companies, pushing up their cost of capital. Moreover, the burden of regulation will benefit firms with superior technology and bigger businesses. That may encourage consolidation and restrict choice.\nThe rules may also create new loopholes in financial markets. Take the clumsily-named \u201csystematic internalisers\u201d, a kind of trading system where banks match orders from clients directly with positions on their books, rather than executing trades through an exchange. These may now have a competitive edge over more heavily regulated exchanges. That could fragment markets and undermine MiFID II\u2019s stated aim of improving transparency.\nLastly, the new rules may encourage more trading to shift outside the EU. Take \u201cdark pools\u201d - trading venues with fewer disclosure requirements than exchanges. By limiting their use, MiFID II may simply push those trades to take place elsewhere.\nA more immediate question is when the rules will actually come into force. German and British regulators have already given clearing houses a last-minute reprieve from rules giving customers more choice over where to clear trades. If that encourages other delays to the rules, or sloppy implementation, the big bang may still be some way off.\nBreakingviews Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

But one recent evening, there was a glittering rack of it: glass orbs containing 2.5 gallons of what is billed as \"raw water\" \u2014 unfiltered, untreated, unsterilized spring water, $36.99 each and $14.99 per refill, bottled and marketed by a small company called Live Water.\n\"It has a vaguely mild sweetness, a nice smooth mouth feel, nothing that overwhelms the flavor profile,\" said Kevin Freeman, a shift manager at the store. \"Bottled water's controversial. We've curtailed our water selection. But this is totally outside that whole realm.\"\nHere on the West Coast and in other pockets around the country, many people are looking to get off the water grid.\nStart-ups like Live Water in Oregon and Tourmaline Spring in Maine have emerged in the last few years to deliver untreated water on demand. An Arizona company, Zero Mass Water, which installs systems allowing people to collect water directly from the atmosphere around their homes, began taking orders in November from across the United States. It has raised $24 million in venture capital.\nAnd Liquid Eden, a water store that opened in San Diego three years ago, offers a variety of options, including fluoride-free, chlorine-free and a \"mineral electrolyte alkaline\" drinking water that goes for $2.50 a gallon.\nTrisha Kuhlmey, the owner, said the shop sells about 900 gallons of water a day, and sales have doubled every year as the \"water consciousness movement\" grows.\nRead more from the New York Times:\nAmerica's Tap Water: Too Much Contamination, Not Enough Reporting, Study Finds\nSelling Bottled Water That's Better for the Planet\nFiber Is Good for You. Now Scientists May Know Why. \nWhat adherents share is a wariness of tap water, particularly the fluoride added to it and the lead pipes that some of it passes through. They contend that the wrong kind of filtration removes beneficial minerals. Even traditional bottled spring water is treated with ultraviolet light or ozone gas and passed through filters to remove algae. That, they say, kills healthful bacteria \u2014 \"probiotics\" in raw-water parlance.\nThe quest for pure water is hardly new; people have been drinking from natural springs and collecting rainwater from time immemorial. The crusade against adding fluoride to public water began in the 1950s among Americans who saw danger in the protective measures that had been adopted over decades to protect the populace from disease and contamination.\nThe New York Times Crooked River, which is primarily fed by the Opal Springs Aquifer, and is the source of the Opal Springs Water Company's unfiltered, untreated, unsterilized spring water, in Culver, Ore., Dec. 4, 2017. But the off-grid water movement has become more than the fringe phenomenon it once was, with sophisticated marketing, cultural cachet, millions of dollars in funding and influential supporters from Silicon Valley.\nOne recent morning in the hills of Berkeley, Calif., Cody Friesen, the founder and chief executive of Zero Mass Water, was inspecting water collection panels he had installed for his investor Skip Battle, a longtime tech leader who now sits on the boards of LinkedIn, Netflix and OpenTable.\nThe system \u2014 called Source, which retails for $4,500, including installation \u2014 draws moisture from the air (the way rice does in a saltshaker) and filters it, producing about 10 liters of water a day and storing about 60 liters. The goal, Mr. Friesen said, is to make water \"that's ultra high quality and secure, totally disconnected from all infrastructure.\"\n\"Just take a breath of air,\" said Mr. Friesen, a professor of materials science at Arizona State University. \"Take a deep breath. No matter how wealthy or poor you are, you can take a breath and own that air that you breathe. And yet water \u2014 the government brings it to you.\"\nMr. Battle's system runs on power from its own small solar panel. It feeds into a tap set up in his stone garden, where he goes to drink. He said he's been making all his meals and drinks with it.\nMr. Battle poured himself a glass. \"The water from the tap just doesn't taste quite as refreshing,\" he said. \"Now is that because I saw it come off the roof, and anything from the roof feels special? Maybe.\"\nThe most prominent proponent of raw water is Doug Evans, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. After his juicing company, Juicero , collapsed in September, he went on a 10-day cleanse, drinking nothing but Live Water. \"I haven't tasted tap water in a long time,\" he said.\nBefore he could order raw water on demand, Mr. Evans went \"spring hunting\" with friends. This has become more challenging lately: The closest spring around San Francisco has recently been cut off by landslides, so reaching it means crossing private property, which he does under cover of night.\n\"You have to be agile and tactile, and be available to experiment,\" he said. \"Literally, you have to carry bottles of water through the dark.\"\nAt Burning Man, the summer festival in the Nevada desert that attracts the digerati and others, Mr. Evans and his R.V. mate brought 50 gallons of spring water they had collected. \"I'm extreme about health, I know, but I'm not alone with this,\" Mr. Evans said. \"There are a lot of people doing this with me. You never know who you'll run into at the spring.\"\nThe founder of Live Water, Mukhande Singh, started selling spring water from Opal Springs in Culver, Ore., three years ago, but it was a small local operation until this year. Marketing materials show Mr. Singh (n\u00e9 Christopher Sanborn) sitting naked and cross-legged on a hot spring, his long brown hair flowing over his chest.\nPure water can be obtained by using a reverse osmosis filter, the gold standard of home water treatment, but for Mr. Singh, the goal is not pristine water, per se. \"You're going to get 99 percent of the bad stuff out,\" he said. \"But now you have dead water.\"\nHe said \"real water\" should expire after a few months. His does. \"It stays most fresh within one lunar cycle of delivery,\" he said. \"If it sits around too long, it'll turn green. People don't even realize that because all their water's dead, so they never see it turn green.\"\nMr. Singh believes that public water has been poisoned. \"Tap water? You're drinking toilet water with birth control drugs in them,\" he said. \"Chloramine, and on top of that they're putting in fluoride. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but it's a mind-control drug that has no benefit to our dental health.\" (There is no scientific evidence that fluoride is a mind-control drug, but plenty to show that it aids dental health.)\nTalk like Mr. Singh's disturbs Dr. Donald Hensrud, the director of the Healthy Living Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. What the raw-water partisans see as dangers, he says, are important safety measures.\n\"Without water treatment, there's acute and then chronic risks,\" Dr. Hensrud said, including E. coli bacteria, viruses, parasites and carcinogenic compounds tha"}

Ben Potter\/Handout via REUTERS \nA single ancestral Native American group split from East Asians about 36,000 year ago and thousands of years later crossed the land bridge, they said. This founding group diverged into two lineages about 20,000 years ago. \nThe first lineage trekked south of the huge ice caps that covered much of North America between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago, spreading throughout North and South America and becoming the ancestors of today\u2019s Native Americans.

A pump jack operates at a well site leased by Devon Energy Production Company near Guthrie, Oklahoma, U.S., September 15, 2015. REUTERS\/Nick Oxford\/Files \nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $61.95 a barrel at 0619 GMT. That was 6 cents below their last close, though still near the $62.21-high reached the previous day, which was their strongest since May, 2015. \nBrent crude futures were at $67.99 a barrel, 8 cents below their last settlement, but still not far off the $68.27-peak from the day before, also the highest since May, 2015. \nTraders said political tensions in Iran, the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), had pushed prices higher. \n\u201cThe protests in Iran add more fuel to the already bullish oil market mood,\u201d said Norbert Ruecker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer. \nOil prices have received general support from production cuts led by OPEC and by Russia, which started in January last year and are set to last through 2018, as well as from strong economic growth and financial markets. \nThat has helped tighten markets. U.S. commercial crude inventories fell by 7.4 million barrels in the week to Dec. 29, to 424.46 million barrels, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). \nThat is down 20 percent from their historic peaks last March and close to the five-year average of 420 million barrels. CAN THE BULL-RUN LAST? \nYet given Iran\u2019s oil production has not been affected by the unrest, and that U.S. output will likely break through 10 million barrels per day (bpd) soon, a level so far only reached by Saudi Arabia and Russia, doubts are emerging whether the bull-run can last. \nU.S. investment bank Jefferies said in a note on Friday that the oil price \u201cupside from here is not obvious to us\u201d, although it added that \u201cwe believe the oil market will remain undersupplied through 2018\u201d. \nRuecker of Julius Baer said crude prices above $60 per barrel project an \u201coverly rosy picture (as) oil production disruptions (in Iran) remain a very distant threat ... disruptions in the North Sea have been removed ... (and) U.S. oil production surpassed the 2015 highs in October and is set to climb to historic highs this year.\u201d \nLukman Otunuga, analyst at futures brokerage FXTM, struck a similarly cautious tone. \n\u201cOil started the New Year on an incredibly bullish note ... in part due to ongoing tensions in Iran ... (and) over OPEC\u2019s supply cut rebalancing the markets,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWhile the current momentum suggests that further upside is on the cards, it must be kept in mind that U.S. shale remains a threat to higher oil prices.\u201d Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Joseph Radford"}

It gave no indication whether the South African government knew of the alleged Iranian activity, or of the Palestinian expatriate\u2019s whereabouts.\nSouth Africa, where pro-Palestinian sentiment is strong, has strained relations with Israel, but the Shin Bet statement also suggested the country effectively served as an Iranian spy hub.\n\u201cIt became clear, during the the Shin Bet investigation, that Iranian intelligence used South Africa as a significant arena for locating, recruiting and running anti-Israel agents in the West Bank,\u201d the Shin Bet said, adding that several Iranian officers had traveled there \u201cfrom Tehran\u201d for the operation.\nSouth Africa\u2019s Foreign Ministry and Home Affairs Ministry, and the Iranian embassy in Pretoria, did not immediately respond to the Israeli allegations.\nDENIAL OF CHARGES The three Palestinians were arrested in November and a trial date has yet to be set, their lawyer, Munther Abu Ahmed, said.\n\u201cThe three young men denied the charges against them,\u201d Abu Ahmed told Reuters.

Seventy-seven different counties in Kansas, which cover most of the state, offer student loan repayments and\/or state income tax waivers as an incentive to get people to move there. \nThe program, called Rural Opportunity Zones (ROZ), has been \"highly effective\" in attracting new residents, Kevin Doel, director of communications at the Kansas Department of Commerce, tells CNBC Make It . Program pays off for graduates with debt \nPacking up your stuff and plopping yourself in a new apartment in one of those Kansas counties won't be enough to get that student loan debt wiped out. \nIn order to be eligible for the student loan repayment program, you must have established residency in the county after July 2011 and on or after the date in which your county opted in to the program, and have obtained either an associate's, bachelor's or post-graduate degree before moving there. \nYou'll also need to have a \" sponsor \" available, which could be either your county or employer. Employers \"have shown strong interest in using this program as a recruitment tool,\" Doel says. For example, Kearny County Hospital is currently sponsoring five individuals, he says. Overall, there are currently 58 sponsoring employers. Once you secure your sponsor, your student loan repayment is funded half by that sponsor and half by the state. \nSo far, the Kansas Department of Commerce has received over 3,400 ROZ applications for student loan repayment assistance, and over one-third of the applicants are moving to Kansas from out-of-state. \n\"The ROZ program has also helped over 2,000 Kansans return home and has attracted individuals with a wide range of talents and occupations,\" Doel tells CNBC Make It. \"It has been particularly effective in attracting educators and healthcare professionals. The ROZ applicants have stated the incentives were important in their decision to move to a ROZ county.\" Student loan debt is crippling the country \nParticipants in Kansas' program can receive annual payments equal to 20 percent of their outstanding student loan balance, up to maximum of $3,000 per year or $15,000 over the course of five years. \nWith the current average student loan debt per borrower nationwide at $26,700, according to consumer spending site ValuePenguin , and the amount of student loan debt ballooning over the past decade by more than 250 percent across the U.S., rural towns might have just found the secret to scoring new residents. show chapters 9:53 AM ET Thu, 6 Oct 2016 | 02:24 \nThe 77 counties participating in the ROZ program also offer a five-year income tax waiver for new residents who have made less than $10,000 in Kansas income within five years prior to moving to the county, with the credit covering 100 percent of the taxpayer's Kansas tax liability. \nCurrently, the income tax credit is available until tax year 2021, according to Kansas' Department of Revenue . However, there is no indication as to what the Kansas legislature will do beyond that point, Doel says. Last month, President Donald Trump signed into law a sweeping tax overhaul, and along with it, a complex tangle of tax code changes that is still being unpacked . Other towns are also offering financial incentives \nData released in March from the U.S. Census Bureau reveals that the population in counties outside of metro areas decreased a bit in 2016, making it the sixth straight year of population decline, FiveThirtyEight reports. In light of shrinking populations, a slew of other towns and cities in rural areas of the country also offer financial perks to incentivize people to move there. \nIn New Richland, Minnesota, for example, you can receive a free lot to build a single-family \"dream home,\" according to a brochure from the town. In order to receive the free land, you must build your new home within one year after the property is deeded to you, and you will be responsible for \"special assessment\" costs to cover things like water and sewage, which could run between $14,000 to $25,000. \nAs another type of incentive to attract new residents, Harmony, Minnesota (which boasts a population of 1,000 residents) offers a cash rebate program for home construction. For those building a new home, the Harmony Economic Development Authority will provide a cash rebate ranging from $5,000 to $12,000. There are no restrictions or limits on the applicant's age, income level or residency, either. \n\"The program has helped create almost $1.1 million in new taxable building value and has gotten us even better mileage as a marketing tool,\" Chris Giesen, vice president of community and economic development associates (which represents the Harmony Economic Development Authority), tells CNBC Make It. \nOther cities that have also offered financial incentives as a tool to recruit new residents include Niagara Falls , New York, Curtis , Nebraska and New Haven , Connecticut. Cities that offer recent grads the best salaries \nIf you recently tossed your cap into the air and have your heart set on skyscrapers and city living\u2014 despite the financial incentives offered by rural areas \u2014 you should still be strategic about which spot you settle on. Pick a city where you can make big bucks to match those big city expenses. \nA report released in May by Trulia and Indeed looks at data from the U.S. Census Bureau and highlights the 10 metro areas where recent college grads earn the most money, CNBC Make It previously reported . \nWashington, D.C. tops the list, with a median monthly pre-tax income of $3,337, followed by San Jose, California at $3,333 and San Francisco at $3,250. Other cities within the top 10 include Hartford, Connecticut and Kansas City, Missouri. show chapters "}

While the company tells CNBC that it will include some information about its financial performance, it's unclear how much and which metrics. CNBC previously reported that the company is poised to notch its second year of profitability in 2018. Airbnb generated nearly $100 million in earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, a source told CNBC, and it grew its top line 150 percent in 2017.\nAccording to CBInsights, Airbnb is the second-most-valuable start-up in the U.S., trailing only Uber.

{"published":"2018-01-24T19:20:00.000+02:00","title":"Another Apple analyst predicts weak growth in iPhone sales this spring","text":"Checks with supply-chain vendors indicate that Apple's iPhone sales may decline about 33 percent between the December 2017 and March 2018 quarters, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a research note released on Tuesday.\nHe predicts Apple will offer implied guidance of 51 million to 57 million iPhones sold for the March quarter, lower than consensus guidance estimates of 62 million. Last year, Apple sold 51 million iPhones in the March quarter.\n\"At a high level, noise in the supply chain appears most pronounced about Apple's March quarter, consistent with the fact that sequential declines could be in line, or worse than recent history,\" Sacconaghi said.\nThat's not too unusual on its own \u2014 Apple usually sells about 30 percent fewer iPhones in the quarter after the holiday shopping rush, Sacconaghi wrote. But the pricey iPhone X was widely expected on Wall Street to drive a \"super-cycle\" thanks to its new form factor, including a screen that takes up the entire front face.\nSo if 2018 turns out to be normal by Apple's standards, it could be a disappointment to investors.\nSacconaghi is the latest analyst to share a sober view of Apple's iPhone X prospects.\nResearch from JP Morgan briefly dinged Apple's stock on Tuesday , predicting that manufacturing of the iPhone X might drop 50 percent between the December and March quarters. Taiwanese media and some supply-chain analysts have also speculated that Apple might be scaling back on its iPhone X production plans.\nStill, Sacconaghi said that since November investors have started adjusting expectations downward, as well as factoring in a boost from tax reform.\nPlus, there are opportunities for Apple to surprise Wall Street. The company's secrecy and advanced, complex production techniques already make it hard to predict what Apple has planned. Now add to the mix higher prices, a staggered iPhone release schedule and an expanded product line that includes Apple Watch, AirPods and HomePod.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.\nWATCH: Apple iPhone 6 battery: What happened when I tried to get it replaced show chapters Apple iPhone 6 battery: what happened when I tried to get it replaced 6:17 PM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 | 01:11"}
{"published":"2018-01-05T19:00:00.000+02:00","title":"Grand Canyon University Submits Application To Return To Non-Profit Status","text":"PHOENIX, Jan. 5, 2018 \/PRNewswire\/ -- Grand Canyon University, a comprehensive regionally accredited university owned and operated by Grand Canyon Education, Inc. (GCE), has submitted an updated application to the Higher Learning Commission to re-establish the institution as a non-profit university upon its purchase of certain academic-related assets from GCE. Following the sale, GCE would operate as a for-profit third-party provider of educational and related services to GCU and potentially, in the future, to other universities. GCE filed an 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission to this effect today and is meeting with all employees to discuss the proposed transaction. The HLC could act on this application as soon as the next HLC Board meeting in February.\nBrian Mueller, president and CEO of GCU, issued the following statement regarding that decision:\n\"The Board of Directors of GCE, together with the Board of Trustees of GCU, are again considering the possibility of returning the university to its historical non-profit status, which it held from 1949-2004. We believe this development would be in the best long-term interests of our students, faculty and staff, the community and our investors, in that it would:\nProvide faculty and students equitable opportunities to participate in academic and co-curricular opportunities with our peer institutions without being segregated based on tax status. Open up the world of non-profit philanthropic giving, grant writing and research opportunities. Better enable the University to continue to hold the line on tuition \u2013 which has been frozen on the ground campus for 10 years \u2013 and keep higher education affordable for all socioeconomic classes of Americans. Allow the university to continue to invest in infrastructure and maximize opportunities for faculty\/staff growth. Maximize opportunities for continued investments in the community. Provide the opportunity for the University to become a full voting member of the NCAA. Allow GCE to continue as a publicly traded educational services company that has the potential to provide services to other institutions in addition to GCU.\n\"In short, this return to our historical non-profit status would convey an accurate reflection of who GCU is today and will be in the future, and brings the University full circle as it continues its transition into one of the driving forces in higher education today.\n\"GCU was a small non-profit private university for 55 years, but in 2004 found itself $20 million in debt and about to close its doors. Without a large donor base to turn to or the ability to rely on tax dollars, the University remained afloat by becoming a for-profit institution, securing investor funding and adding an online component to its academic offerings. In 2008, in order to develop a state-of-the-art online learning system, grow out the ground campus and ensure long-term stability, GCU went to the public markets for an infusion of capital to invest into the university. As a result of those investments, GCU today has a strong hybrid campus model that has enabled it to grow enrollment on the ground campus from less than 1,000 in 2004 to approximately 19,000 today, and create an online campus that now has more than 70,000 students, with more than half of those studying at the graduate level.\n\"That growth has also had a huge impact on our community. A 2015 study performed by Elliott Pollack & Company found that, from 2010-2019, GCU will:\nGenerate an estimated $450 million in city, county and state tax revenue, in addition to an estimated $650 million in federal income taxes. Generate an average of 10,490 jobs on an annual basis, with wages totaling $487.7 million. Provide an economic impact of $11.1 billion to the Phoenix area.\n\"GCU has further distinguished its innovative approach to higher education in that it has never paid a dividend to its shareholders since becoming a publicly traded institution in 2008. Those shareholders have received a return on their investment via increases in the value of the stock price that are a result of the University's continued success. Further, GCU has invested more into its campus infrastructure and technology -- $1 billion over a 10-year period \u2013 than it has made in after-tax profits during that time. No other university has used a publicly traded for-profit business model to develop a hybrid university with both ground and online campuses. In addition to investing in its outstanding academic programs, the University has developed all of the trappings of a traditional university, including music, dance, theater, debate, intramural and club sports, and a Division I athletic program.\n\"Today, GCU has a very strong financial model and there is no need to go back to the public markets for further capital. The current proposal to the HLC provides the best of both worlds by re-establishing a non-profit regionally accredited university that can continue to grow and meet the demand of families interested in affordable, private Christian education, while allowing GCE to continue as a tax-paying, multi-billion dollar market cap, publicly traded company in the fast-growing educational service market industry, with its headquarters in Phoenix.\nDetails of the HLC proposal\n\"These FAQs ( https:\/\/news.gcu.edu\/2018\/01\/faqs-proposal-re-establish-gcu-non-profit-institution\/ ) go into greater detail about the structure of the proposed transactions and its implications. It is important to note that the proposal is NOT being done to escape current regulations that are imposed only on the for-profit sector. For example, because GCU maintains affordable tuition, none of its programs failed the gainful employment regulations. GCU's loan default rate will be an estimated 6.5% for the most recent cohort \u2013 well below federal guidelines. For the 90\/10 rule, GCU sits at 72.3% (and dropping). The University supports measures that ensure educational institutions are meeting recognized standards -- particularly as it relates to student support services, academic integrity and financial transparency \u2013 and believes those measures should apply to all institutions (for-profit and non-profit).\n\"GCU also has an exemplary record of regulatory compliance, including visits from six major accrediting bodies within the past two years. GCU met those comprehensive reviews with 100 percent compliance, including a visit from HLC in which the University's accreditation was reaffirmed for an additional 10 years, which is the maximum extension of accreditation the HLC offers. In addition to the HLC accreditation, GCU recently received the maximum 10-year accreditation from the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education; completed the four-year transition to NCAA Division I athletics; completed a Veterans Administration audit with no findings; received a 10-year reaccreditation from the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs; and has been granted associate membership of the Association of Theological Schools as it completes the process for full accreditation.\nWhy now?\n\"GCU initially explored reverting to its nonprofit status in 2015-16. That application was denied by the HLC, in part, based on its view that it did not have the necessary guidelines in place to evaluate the type of shared services agreement that GCU proposed. In May 2017, GCU became aware that the HLC was considering adopting new"}

I believe Barclays and our view has been heard by the British government,\" he said.\n\"A long way to go, but I don't think the British government has been blind to the importance of London and the importance of a bank like Barclays.\"\nLooking forward for the U.K., Staley emphasized the importance of regulatory uniformity after Brexit.\n\"I think the U.K. should negotiate a regulatory regime which is roughly equivalent to Europe to keep us having access to that single market,\" Staley said. \"Now that the United States has basically said we're going to take a different regulatory tact, maintaining the regulatory flexibility in the U.K. to keep London competitive with New York is another dimension to this debate.\"\nThe American banker took over as Barclays chief executive in 2015 on a pledge to rebuild the bank's scandal-ridden reputation, becoming its fifth CEO in seven years. Prior to that he spent 34 years at J.P. Morgan , eventually becoming CEO."}

( DECK.N ) last year, ended 2017 with a 25.6 percent gain at its flagship fund while its smaller Encore portfolio climbed 22.6 percent. \nAtlantic Investment Management, which focuses on bets that inexpensive stocks will appreciate in value, posted a 16.4 percent gain in its Cambrian Global Fund. \nBoth firms beat the industry average with industry tracking firm Hedge Fund Research reporting that the average hedge fund gained 7.6 percent through the end of November. \nStock oriented funds posted a 12 percent gain through November. December numbers have not been released as many hedge funds are still tabulating their performance for the year, but so far the industry is on track to post its best returns since 2013, the Hedge Fund Research data show. \nSimilarly Renaissance Technologies, staffed by nearly eight dozen scientists with doctorates in physics, math and other fields, posted a 15 percent gain in its Renaissance Institutional Equities fund, the firm\u2019s oldest portfolio available to outsiders. \nBrahman Capital posted a 12 percent gain in its hedge fund while a portfolio that makes only long bets that securities will rise climbed 22 percent. \nActivist hedge fund Engaged Capital, which pushed for changes at tea maker Hain Celestial Group ( HAIN.O ) rental company Rent-A-Center ( RCII.O ) last year, posted a 10.7 percent gain. \nHedge funds are private and generally guard their performance numbers closely. Representatives for the firms declined to comment. \nThe gains suggest better times in the hedge fund industry after investors spent years complaining about low returns and high fees. Investors even added $2.9 billion in new money to the industry in the first three quarters of 2017 after having pulled out $70 billion in 2016, data from Hedge Fund Research show. \nSome firms even celebrated single-digit gains, signalling a rebound after a difficult 2016 or early 2017. Greenlight Capital, run by David Einhorn, ended the year with a 2 percent gain while Folger Hill, run by former SAC chief operating officer Sol Kumin, ended the year with a 2.6 percent gain in its U.S. fund and a 3.6 percent gain in its Asia fund.

{"published":"2018-01-08T13:58:00.000+02:00","title":"Bulls are betting this market will be the G.O.A.T. (greatest of all time)","text":"5 Hours Ago | 01:19 \nTo be aggressively optimistic on this stock market now is to bet that it can challenge the greatest bull market of all-time \u2014 the 13-year run that ended in early 2000 . \nIn terms of its cumulative gains, persistence, valuation and the public's exposure to stocks, only the final years of the 1990s advance sit at higher elevations. \nThis might sound scary, given how singular that bubbly period now seems \u2014 and given the brutal wealth destruction that followed. And it should be sobering, in terms of what it means for longer-term expected equity returns. \nBut here's the good news, for now. First, this market is hinting that it's accelerating in that direction. There's also a good deal of room overhead in terms of price gains between where we are and the late-'90s extremes. And, finally, in the areas where today's backdrop differs from the 1987-2000 version, the current one looks better in terms of corporate fundamentals and capital-markets behavior. \nIn two months, the climb from the depths of the financial crisis market low is set to reach nine years. The overall S&P 500 gain is now 306 percent, not including dividends. That's better than any other except the 1987-2000 glory run \u2014 which was a stunning 582 percent. \nThe annualized gain since March 2009 is nearly 16 percent. That's well above the long-term average, but then again, when major bull markets have ended, the trailing 10-year annualized gain has often topped 20 percent. \n(There is no absolute definition of bull markets. Some quibble that the recovery from the 2009 low didn't turn into a wholly new bull market until it hit a fresh record high in early 2013. Others say the 1990 setback or the tumble in late-2015 into early 2016 was effectively a mini-bear market that reset the clock. Fair enough \u2014 that's what makes market debates.) \nValuation \u2014 whether based on the past year's reported earnings, forecast earnings for the coming year or the fun-spoiling Shiller-CAPE measure using 10 years of average profits \u2014 all show U.S. stocks more richly valued than any period except the late-'90s. \nThe trailing 12-month price\/earnings multiple for the S&P 500 is now approaching 23. Once again, the tech bubble was so extreme that there remains plenty of room between here and that peak. \nAs Bespoke Investment Group says, the P\/E \"didn't once get above this level during the 2002-2007 bull market, but it was consistently above 23 during the final three years of the bull market that ended in early 2000. From 1998 to 2000, the S&P's P\/E expanded from 23 up to 30+.\" \nSource: Bespoke Investment Group \nLeuthold Group notes that last week's strong start to the year took the S&P's price-to-sales ratio above where it was at the year-2000 market peak. This speaks to today's high profit margins \u2014 boosted in part by madly profitable winner-take-most tech giants. \nHigh hopes are also implicit in investors' elevated equity holdings. There remains a stubborn narrative that the little guy has boycotted this bull market , but it likely relies too much on traditional mutual-fund flow stats and doesn't recognize that individuals have let stock allocations stretch higher with share prices. \nThe monthly asset-allocation survey of American Association of Individual Investors shows stocks at 72 percent of member portfolios, highest since 2000, when they peaked at 77 percent. The Fed's measure of household equity holdings shows a similar trend. And cash reserves in Charles Schwab client accounts recently hit an all-time low. \nSource: J. Lyons Funds Management \nMichael Hartnett, strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, has been calling for a crescendo of investor confidence for some time and believes this \"Icarus trade\" is still rising but isn't yet high enough to melt the market's wings. He's waiting for stock holdings of BAML retail clients to exceed 63 percent (now 60.8) and institutional-client cash levels to drop below 4 percent (now 4.7). \nThis has become a popular stance: Conceding the market is expensive and the mood is getting giddy but expecting an even more intense public-participation phase to carry equities higher before there's any reckoning. Value investor Jeremy Grantham of GMO last week effectively called for a manic \"bubble phase\" soon for stocks. \nIt's all pretty neat and tidy, with the added virtue of being plausible \u2014 and supported by the market's behavior itself. Market breadth is healthy. Only three of Citigroup's 18 indicators of a coming bear market are flashing red. Last week's 2.6-percent S&P 500 gain in four days would have made it the best week of 2017, a sign of expanding risk-taking appetites and more eagerness among buyers. \nFor sure, in the very short term, tactical sentiment signals are flashing a yellow light. The Daily Sentiment Index of professional traders for stocks hit 95 percent bulls late last week. Citi's Panic-Euphoria Index edged into \"euphoria\" in recent days for only the second time during this bull market. \nAnd we're pushing 400-straight trading days without even a 5 percent market dip, rivaling the longest ever streak. The way the three prior ones eventually ended? With a decline of \"more than 7 percent over 30-40 days,\" says Jason Goepfert of SentimenTrader.com \u2014 but none marked the end of a bull market. \nIf this market run is ultimately to end in overconfidence and silly economic distortions, we're not there yet. Stock-sector weightings remain right in line with their earnings contribution, unlike in 2000. There's no rush of wild initial public offerings \u2014 or even many at all, which keeps alive the idea of lots of cash chasing scarce assets. \nWe've scaled the wall of worry, and everyone likes the view. Tech giants coining money in a deflationary innovation boom are thriving alongside cyclical \"reflation\" sectors feeding a global production surge. \nGobs of \"house money\" winnings have accrued in investment accounts, boosting risk appetites and likely buffering the downside on the first gut check. The corporate tax cut has arrived just in time to furnish a new bullish story line and provide an alibi for stretched valuations. \nSo what could possibly go wrong?

He was 85. \nWriting in Hebrew, the Romanian-born Appelfeld penned more than 40 books and was one of Israel\u2019s most widely translated authors. \nAppelfeld\u2019s \u201cBlooms of Darkness\u201d, the tale of an 11-year-old boy hidden from the Nazis by a prostitute, won the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize in London in 2012. Appelfeld was also awarded the State of Israel Prize for Literature in 1983 and was a Man Booker International Prize finalist in 2013. \nIsraeli President Reuven Rivlin, on Twitter, expressed sorrow \u201cabout the passing of our beloved writer\u201d. \nAmos Oz, one of Israel\u2019s most prominent novelists, said on Army Radio that Appelfed shied away from graphic depictions of the Holocaust, choosing instead to describe its effect on the lives of his characters. \n\u201cAppelfeld never wrote about gas chambers, never wrote about executions, about mass graves, atrocities and experiments on human beings. He wrote about survivors before and after. He wrote about people who did not know what was about to happen to them and about people who already knew everything but hardly spoke about it,\u201d Oz said on Army Radio. \n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want, or he was unable, to write depictions of the horrors - he said that too. They are beyond the ability of human language to express them. You have to approach them indirectly, tiptoeing from afar,\u201d said Oz, once Appelfeld\u2019s student in a kibbutz. \nAppelfeld was a young boy when his mother was killed by the Nazis. He and his father were sent to a concentration camp in Transnistria in an area of Ukraine then under control of the German-allied Romanian forces. Aged 10 at the time, he escaped and spent three years hiding in forests in Ukraine. \n\u201cI survived in the fields and forests. Sometimes I worked as a shepherd or taking care of broken-down horses,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1986. \u201cI lived with marginal people during the war - prostitutes, horse thieves, witches, fortune tellers. They gave me my real education.\u201d \nAfter the war, he immigrated to Israel - he learned Hebrew beforehand - and when he was 28 he discovered that his father had survived and they were reunited in Israel. \n\u201cEven though I spent time on kibbutzim that tried to change me, I did not change. I remained, basically, the Jewish refugee child who survived,\u201d he said in an interview with Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper in 2015. \nAmerican-Jewish author Philip Roth once described Appelfeld as a \u201cdisplaced writer of displaced fiction, who made displacement and disorientation a subject uniquely his own\u201d. \nWorks by Appelfeld translated into English include \u201cBadenheim 1939\u201d (1978), a tale set in a fictional Austrian resort on the eve of World War Two, and \u201cThe Immortal Bartfuss\u201d (1988), a fictional portrait of a troubled survivor in Israel.

Brent hit $68.27 high last week, the highest since May 2015, on Iran tensions.\nSaudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s de-facto leader, wants to see oil prices above $60 a barrel, to boost the valuation of its national oil company Aramco ahead of an initial public offering (IPO) later this year and to reduce the gap in its state budget, Saudi sources have said.\n\u201cEven if there was a supply disruption (from Iran or Venezuela)... OPEC will not raise output,\u201d the senior OPEC source said.\n\u201cOPEC\u2019s policy is to bring inventories down to their normal levels and will stay the course, unless the disruption in supply of something like 1,000,000 barrels per day persists for more than a month, and causes shortages of crude supply to consumers.\u201d\nVenezuela\u2019s dilapidated energy sector is struggling as U.S. sanctions and a lack of capital hobble operations, and its economic crisis threatens to do further harm to the OPEC country.\nThe senior OPEC source also said the oil market was on its way to being re-balanced, but so far global oil inventories remained above their five-year average and much more time was needed to drain the oil glut.\n\u201cAny change in production limits must be driven by a change in market fundamentals and not just speculations for a short period of time, for OPEC to change the output ceiling,\u201d he said.\nThe protests in Iran that began in late December have posed no immediate threat to oil production but there is concern that U.S. President Donald Trump may reimpose sanctions on Iranian oil, which could disrupt oil exports.\nTrump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil exports under the terms of an international nuclear deal.\nThe senior OPEC source said that while more U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil were possible, they would take time to affect oil supplies and so their impact was difficult to gauge.\nOPEC, supported by Russia and other non-members, began to reduce output a year ago to remove an oil glut built up in the previous two years. Compliance has been high, as producers have decided to extend the supply pact until the end of 2018.\nOPEC\u2019s cuts are helping to reduce global inventories, even as production continues to rise in the United States.

Jean-Yves Ahern-USA TODAY Sports \nFederer won 6-3 7-6(8) as his Australian Open preparation gained momentum but the 19-times grand slam champion was pushed hard in the second set by the 21-year-old in front of a record crowd of 13,943 at the Perth Arena. \nPlaying with little inhibition and plenty of power, Khachanov broke Federer early on before the Swiss switched gears to march ahead and take the opening set in 29 minutes. \nFederer, who beat Khachanov in straight sets at Halle last year in their only previous meeting, showed his experience in the second-set tie breaker that swung back and forth and clinched the contest on his third match point. \n\u201cIt was nice to see him free swinging the entire match, which isn\u2019t easy to do,\u201d Federer said of his opponent. \n\u201dI remember those days, match point down, you go for it, you don\u2019t care.

Osaka\u2019s withdrawal gave CoCo Vandeweghe a 6-0 6-0 victory in their singles match. \nJapan drew level after Jack Sock retired while trailing against Yuichi Sugita but Osaka\u2019s absence meant the Americans were awarded a 4-0 4-0 win in the deciding mixed doubles rubber.

Abdun-Nabi, president and chief executive officer of Emergent BioSolutions, said, \u201cOur exceptional financial and operational performance in 2017 builds upon Emergent\u2019s history of growth and innovation, and demonstrates our ability to execute on a focused strategy that leverages our proven core competencies. We are excited about this momentum as we enter 2018, our 20th year in business, well-positioned for continued growth in pursuit of our 2020 growth plan goals.\u201d\nPRELIMINARY FULL YEAR 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS (Unaudited)\n(in millions) PRELIMINARY\n(As of 1\/8\/2018) Previous Guidance\n(As of 11\/2\/2017) Total Revenues $555 to $560 $540 to $560 BioThrax \u00ae ~$286 $280 to $290 Pre-Tax Income $113 to $117 NA Net Income (1) $80 to $84 $70 to $80 Adjusted Net Income (1) (2) $92 to $96 $85 to $95 EBITDA (2) $160 to $164 $150 to $160 Cash ~$180 NA (1) Reflects an estimated effective tax rate that includes the expected effects of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on the company\u2019s 2017 income tax provision.\n(2) See \u201cReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income and EBITDA\u201d for a definition of terms and a reconciliation table.\nTotal Revenue\nFor the full year 2017, the company anticipates total revenue of $555 to $560 million, the midpoint of which represents a $69 million or 14% increase from 2016. This increase is due primarily to higher BioThrax \u00ae (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed) sales of approximately $286 million versus $237 million in 2016, as well as higher Other Product sales and CMO revenue, offset by lower Contract & Grant revenue.\nNet Income (GAAP and Adjusted)\nFor the full year 2017, the company anticipates net income of $80 to $84 million, the midpoint of which represents a $20 million or 32% increase from 2016. Full year 2017 adjusted net income is anticipated to be $92 to $96 million, the midpoint of which represents a $17 million or 22% increase from 2016 (see \u201cReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income and EBITDA\u201d for a definition of terms and a reconciliation table). The year-over-year increase reflects the impact of higher product sales and CMO services revenue, lower R&D and SG&A costs, and the positive impact of a lower estimated effective tax rate due largely to the absence in 2017 of certain 2016 items attributable to the August 2016 spin-off of Aptevo Therapeutics that negatively impacted the 2016 tax provision.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor the full year 2017, the company anticipates cash and cash equivalents at year end of approximately $180 million, reflecting the impact of the following that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2017:\nthe closing of the acquisitions of ACAM2000 \u00ae , (Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine, Live) and raxibacumab; and the purchase of shares of the company\u2019s common equity pursuant to the company\u2019s share buyback program.\nNote\nThe preliminary 2017 financial results are subject to revision and will be finalized upon completion of the company\u2019s external audit, which is anticipated in late February 2018. Once the external audit is completed, the company may report financial results that could differ, and the differences could be material.\n2018 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK\n(in millions) Full Year 2018\n(Forecast as of 1\/8\/2018) Total Revenues $715 to $755 Pre-Tax Income $120 to $140 Net Income (1) $95 to $110 Adjusted Net Income (1) (2) $110 to $125 EBITDA (2) $175 to $190 (1) Reflects an estimated effective tax rate that includes the expected effects of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on the company\u2019s 2018 income tax provision.\n(2) See \u201cReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income and EBITDA\u201d for a definition of terms and a reconciliation table.\nFor the full year of 2018, the company outlook includes the impact of the following items:\ncontinued deliveries of BioThrax to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) under our follow-on procurement contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); deliveries of ACAM2000 to the SNS under the CDC procurement contract; deliveries of raxibacumab to the SNS under the procurement contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA); domestic and international sales of the other medical countermeasures that comprise Other Product sales; continued expansion of our CMO services business unit; increased Contract & Grant revenue due to anticipated increased work related to development projects funded by the U.S. government; increased investment in discretionary, development projects funded by the company targeting opportunities in medical countermeasures for emerging infectious diseases; and anticipated reduced tax rate resulting from revisions to U.S. corporate tax laws.\nThe outlook for 2018 does not include estimates for potential new corporate development or other M&A transactions.\nQ1 2018\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the company anticipates total revenues of $145 to $160 million.\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND EBITDA\nThis press release contains two financial measures (Adjusted Net Income and EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization)) that are considered \u201cnon-GAAP\u201d financial measures under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The company\u2019s definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. Adjusted Net Income adjusts for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict, or reflect the non-cash impact of charges resulting from purchase accounting. EBITDA reflects net income excluding the impact of depreciation, amortization, interest expense and provision for income taxes. The company views these non-GAAP financial measures as a means to facilitate management\u2019s financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of the company\u2019s historical operating results and comparison to competitors\u2019 operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company\u2019s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the company\u2019s business.\nThe determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures are a matter of management judgment and depend upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the company\u2019s reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income\n($ "}

His ultimate goal, after all, had never been to win. ... \u2018This is bigger than I ever dreamed of,\u2019 he told (former Fox News chief Roger) Ailes a week before the election. \u2018I don\u2019t think about losing, because it isn\u2019t losing. We\u2019ve totally won.'\u201d\n\u201cOnce he lost, Trump would be both insanely famous and a martyr to Crooked Hillary. His daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared would be international celebrities. Steve Bannon would become the de facto head of the tea-party movement. Kellyanne Conway would be a cable-news star. Melania Trump, who had been assured by her husband that he wouldn\u2019t become president, could return to inconspicuously lunching. Losing would work out for everybody. Losing was winning.\u201d\nAfter Melania Trump was inconsolable that the New York Post obtained outtakes from a nude photo shoot done early in her modeling carer, Trump told her they would sue. \u201cBut he was unaccustomedly contrite, too. Just a little longer, he told her. It would all be over in November. He offered his wife a solemn guarantee: there was simply no way he would win.\u201d\nELECTION DAY \u201cShortly after 8 p.m. on Election Night, when the unexpected trend - Trump might actually win - seemed confirmed, Don Jr. told a friend that his father, or DJT, as he calls him, looked as if he had seen a ghost. Melania was in tears - and not of joy.\u201d\n\u201d(Kellyanne) Conway, the campaign\u2019s manager, was in a remarkably buoyant mood, considering she was about to experience a resounding, if not cataclysmic, defeat. ... Now she briefed some of the television producers and anchors whom she had been carefully courting since joining the Trump campaign \u2014 and with whom she had been actively interviewing in the last few weeks, hoping to land a permanent on-air job after the election.\nAFTER THE VICTORY \u201cBalancing risk against reward, both Jared (Kushner) and Ivanka decided to accept roles in the West Wing over the advice of almost everyone they knew. It was a joint decision by the couple, and, in some sense, a joint job. Between themselves, the two had made an earnest deal: If sometime in the future the opportunity arose, she\u2019d be the one to run for president. The first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton; it would be Ivanka Trump.\u201d\nBANNON ON JUNE 2016 TRUMP TOWER RUSSIA MEETING \u201cThe chance that Don Jr did not walk these jumos up to this father\u2019s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero.\u201d\n\u201cThe three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor - with no lawyers. They didn\u2019t have any lawyers.\u201d\n\u201cEven if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it\u2019s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.\u201d\nReporting by Mark Hosenball, Doina Chiacu; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n "}

You're never on offense,\" John explains. \nInstead, make sure you find the time to ask yourself, \"Why am I getting up today?\" John says. \"What is the end purpose of today? What did I do today that I need to do better tomorrow? What did I not get to today? \nFor John, \"The way that you use the 24 hours in the day for the best is to find out what you want the most out of that day.\" Then work hard and accomplish it. "}

Hatch's announcement came only days after the Republican tax plan that he helped to craft got signed into law. \nHatch tweet \nPresident Donald Trump had urged Hatch, the Senate Finance Committee chairman, to seek re-election later this year. Hatch showered Trump with praise during and after Congress' passage of its tax bill, setting himself apart from some GOP senators who criticized Trump's actions or fitness for office this year. \nIn the video, Hatch said he was \"deeply grateful\" to serve as a senator and said \"the next chapter in my public service is just beginning.\" \nWhen the president visited Utah last month, he said I was a fighter. I've always been a fighter. I was an amateur boxer in my youth, and I brought that fighting spirit with me to Washington. But every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves.

Romney has strongly criticized Trump and could prove another irritant to the president if he gets elected. \nTrump had lobbied Hatch to stay in the Senate. \nFollowing Congress' passage of the tax plan in December, the senator praised Trump's first year in office. \n\"Mr. President, I have to say that you're living up to everything I thought you would,\" he said at a White House event. \"You're one heck of a leader, and we're all benefiting from it.\" \nHatch first got sworn into the Senate in 1977.

He'd often write from his cubicle while, at the time, working at Morgan Stanley.\nFast forward to today, and Kelly oversees more than 20 full-time staff, 50 global contributors and his platform boasts more than two million followers on social media.\nKelly said he knew it was time to make the leap from his corporate job after about a year of blogging as many of his colleagues approached him for advice on how to best use their airline miles.\nHere's Kelly's 7 tips to success and making the leap.\n1. Put yourself first \"Huge corporations are not going to look out for your best interests,\" he told CNBC. When he first told his boss at Morgan Stanley that he was quitting to work on the blog, his boss suggested he stay for a few extra months. He stayed for a few more months, but looking back, said he regrets the decision and wishes he quit sooner.\n2. It's never too late Kelly said many people around 2010 were telling him it's too late to become a travel blogger, but he didn't listen.\nNow, he said, \"I never tell people it's too late. Just have a point of view, have a perspective.\"\nKelly suggests finding the appropriate platform. \"Being a YouTuber may not be the right fit for what you're talking about, but starting a private Facebook group might be.\"\n3. 'Crazy' means you're onto something \"When people tell you you're crazy, you know you're onto something,\" Kelly said.\nHe had his fair share of doubters when he decided to work on The Points Guy full time: \"My mom said, 'What are you going to do for health benefits?' I was like 'I'll pay for health benefits!'\"\n4. A business plan is optional Kelly's business model changed numerous times during his first few years. Now his revenue comes from web clicks, partnerships and sponsored content from airlines and credit card companies. \"Always be open to reiterating your business model and don't think too much about the actual business plan,\" he said. \"I've never had an actual business plan.\"\n5. Listen to your gut Luckily for Kelly, his blog grew after he quit his corporate job, but he still sees any failures as part of the process.\n\"When your gut tells you to do it, just do it. Don't be afraid to fail, just try to do it smartly.\"\n6. Don't get bogged down in details Kelly said the digital age has brought on a plethora of opportunities. In fact, he first bought his web domain for just $10.\n\"Don't think you have to hire lawyers and do an LLC,\" he said. \"People get bogged down in details.\"\n7. Be a shameless self-promoter Kelly's Instagram account boasts photos of him riding business class on flights or doing yoga at The Ritz Carlton in Bali, Indonesia. Many of his captions share information on how he was able to squeeze credit out of certain credit cards, to find better deals.\n\"People don't want to just see you in their Facebook pages pushing your product,\" he said. \"Help people with what you're trying to do and you'll strike a balance \u2014 but you've got to hustle.\""}

Bloomberg tweet: Taxing solar panels up to 30% will destroy U.S. jobs, raise Americans' electric bills and hurt our environment. Congress should stand up for American workers and consumers and overturn the administration's harmful decision. \nEarlier in the day, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announced that President Donald Trump had approved tariffs on imported solar cells and certain washing machines. \nThe protective taxes on both kinds of imports would initially kick in at a higher rate in the first year, then decrease in subsequent years. \nA 30 percent tariff would be applied to imported solar modules and cells in the first year. In the subsequent three years, that number would decrease to 25 percent, then 20 percent and then 15 percent. \nThe idea of tariffs sharply divides the U.S. solar industry. American panel manufacturers support tariffs, since they would cut competition from cheap Chinese imports. U.S. panel installers oppose them because fewer Chinese imports mean less work putting them in place. \nSolar power accounted for about 374,000 jobs in the U.S., according to a January 2017 report from the Department of Energy. \nReacting to Monday's decision, the Solar Energy Industries Association \u2014 a trade body for the solar energy industry in the U.S. \u2014 said it was disappointed. The trade body said in a statement that the decision will \"cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year, including many in manufacturing\" and it will also delay or cancel \"billions of dollars in solar investments.\" \nLast year, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in favor of solar panel manufacturers that were seeking protection from imports. \nLighthizer said in a statement that the tariff move made clear that the Trump Administration would always defend American workers and businesses. \nMonday's move marked a new step in the administration's efforts to revamp existing trade deals between the U.S. and other countries. Since taking office, Trump has pulled the U.S. out of a major 12-nation trade agreement and started renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. \nTrump has repeatedly said he wants better trade relationships for the United States \u2014 meaning deals that would see greater benefit to local businesses and American workers. \n\u2014CNBC's Ted Kemp and Christine Wang contributed to this report.

Currently, sole proprietors can purchase individual insurance through the Obamacare individual market, created under former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law.\nThe rule must go through a comment period but is likely to gain approval, helping to enact an executive order Republican President Donald Trump signed in October.\nUnder Obamacare, all health insurance plans must cover a set of 10 essential health benefits, such as maternity and newborn care, addiction and mental health treatment and prescription drugs. The proposed rule would allow small business associations to purchase health plans that do not necessarily cover all of these benefits, which proponents say would help lower premiums.\nThe rule does not allow Small Business Health Plans to charge those with pre-existing conditions more or exclude employees because of their health.\nProponents of Obamacare say the rule would undermine the individual insurance market created under the law by allowing young and healthy people to purchase cheaper insurance, leaving the sickest and most expensive patients in the Obamacare markets, driving up costs. Hospitals, insurers and medical groups criticized the rule in December and said it would make health insurance unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions.\nThe rule could destabilize several states\u2019 individual insurance markets because healthier people could access cheaper insurance, said Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel, adding that it is still unclear whether significant numbers of people will opt for the slimmer plans.\nRepublicans, who have unified control of government, have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, a top 2016 presidential campaign promise of Trump. Instead, the administration has sought to dismantle the law through administrative rules and executive orders.\nRepublicans dealt their biggest blow to the healthcare program in their tax overhaul, which Trump signed into law last month. The law in 2019 repeals the individual mandate, the requirement that most Americans purchase health insurance or else pay a fine. Health policy experts say the mandate helps ensure a viable market.\nSeveral business groups, including the National Restaurant Association and the National Retail Federation, on Thursday praised the proposed rule, saying it would enable millions of people to obtain more affordable health insurance.\nBut Democrats and medical advocacy groups blasted the rule, saying it put affordable health insurance further out of reach for many Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions.\n\u201cThe Trump administration has declared open season for fraudsters selling junk insurance while those with pre-existing conditions will find healthcare further and further out of reach,\u201d Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said.\nReporting By Yasmeen Abutaleb; Editing by Andrew Hay and Jonathan Oatis\n "}

Tennis - ATP World Tour Finals Preview - The O2 Arena, London, Britain - November 11, 2017 Great Britain's Andy Murray stands during a minutes silence as part of remembrance commemorations during practice Action Images via Reuters\/Tony O'Brien \nMurray has not played a competitive match since a Wimbledon quarter-final loss last July due to the complaint and despite coming through a one-set exhibition in Abu Dhabi last week, he was unable to train on Tuesday and announced his withdrawal. \n\u201cI\u2018m very disappointed to be withdrawing from the Brisbane International,\u201d Murray, seeded second in Brisbane, told tournament organisers before going into further detail of his predicament in an emotional post on social media. \n\u201cHaving been recommended to treat my hip conservatively since the U.S. Open, I have done everything asked of me from a rehab perspective and worked extremely hard to try get back on the court competing,\u201d Murray said on his Instagram account. \n\u201dHaving played practice sets here in Brisbane with some top players unfortunately this hasn\u2019t worked yet to get me to the level I would like so I have to reassess my options.

Trump has denied using that word. \nDHS said in a regulatory filing that it was removing Haiti from lists of more than 80 countries whose citizens can be granted H-2A and H-2B visas, given to seasonal workers in agriculture and other industries. \nIt cited what it said were \u201chigh levels of fraud and abuse\u201d by Haitians with the visas, and a \u201chigh rate of overstaying the terms\u201d of their visas. \nA DHS report published last year stated that Haitians on a variety of non-immigrant visas, including H-2As and H-2Bs, had a roughly 40 percent visa overstay rate in the 2016 fiscal year. \nBelize and Samoa were also removed from the lists, for risks stemming from human trafficking and not taking back nationals ordered removed from the United States, respectively. \nJust a few dozen Haitians entered the United States on the visas each year since they were given permission to do so in 2012 by the Obama administration, according to DHS data. \nSixty-five Haitians entered the United States on H-2A visas, given for agricultural work, in the 2016 fiscal year, according to DHS data, and 54 Haitians were granted H-2A visas by the State Department between March and November 2017. The number of Haitians entering in 2016 on H-2B visas, which are for non-agricultural seasonal work, was more than zero but too low to report, according to DHS. \nSupporters of the visas say they gave Haitians a rare opportunity to work legally in the United States, contribute to the U.S. economy, and help fund the recovery of Haiti after the earthquake, which killed more than 200,000 people. \n\u201cThey\u2019re just cutting off the most economically beneficial visa for the Haitian people,\u201d said Sarah Williamson, founder of PTP Consulting, a Virginia-based consultancy that ran a pilot program to bring Haitians to the United States on the visas. \u201cEven though not many people have been able to avail themselves of it, it\u2019s been hugely transformational for those who have participated.\u201d \nThe Haitian embassy in the United States did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Officials in Haiti were not immediately available for comment. Demonstrators hold up Haitian flags and shout as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., January 15, 2018. REUTERS\/Kevin Lamarque \nIn an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Trump praised Haitians. \n\u201cI love the people. There\u2019s a tremendous warmth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re very hard-working people.\u201d \nHumanitarian groups and Republican and Democratic members of Congress lobbied the Obama administration to make Haiti eligible for the short-term worker visas, arguing that remittances to family in Haiti would help the country recover from the earthquake. Without H-2A and H-2B visas, there are few legal avenues for most Haitians to go to the United States. \n\u201cThe post-earthquake reconstruction efforts ignored migration and remittances entirely,\u201d said Michael Clemens, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development who was heavily involved in the efforts to allow Haitian workers to come to the United States. \u201cWe saw it as an opportunity to help Haiti rebuild after the earthquake.\u201d \nThe Obama administration added Haiti to the list of approved countries in 2012, and PTP Consulting stepped in to screen and match Haitian workers with farmers in the United States. \nIn countries with more experience sending workers to the United States, such as Jamaica, the home-country government typically does much of that work and regulates the H-2A process heavily, Williamson said. \nJon Hegeman, who operates a commercial greenhouse in Alabama, brought in eight Haitian H-2A workers in 2015 through the consultancy, and nine workers in 2016. \nBefore Hegeman hired Haitians, his business had trouble finding local workers. Within a three-month period, they went through 300 people for eight positions, he said. When he was approached by PTP to participate in the program, he agreed. \n\u201cThese guys were awesome. They worked hard, you see a smile on their face every day,\u201d said Hegeman, who as the child of a missionary was born and largely raised in the Dominican Republic, which neighbors Haiti. \u201cWe\u2019ve changed or impacted communities in Haiti.\u201d \nHe said he would escort his workers to the airport in order to make sure they left the United States when their visas ran out. \n\u201cThat was one of my biggest concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had zero visa overstays.\u201d \nWilliamson said PTP was able to ensure the return to Haiti of every worker that came through its program, but said other companies applying for H-2A visas for Haitians may not have been as scrupulous.

It is our responsibility to ensure that they are working as intended and - given the breadth and complexity of this new body of regulation - it is inevitable that we will be able to improve them, especially with the benefit of experience and hindsight.\""}

Therefore, they recommend regulating them together and extending to them prevention tactics like pack size requirements and flavor restrictions.\n\"We have a public rhetoric around e-cigarettes that's really strong, but we should be thinking about other products,\" said Shannon Lea Watkins, one of the study's authors and a postdoctoral scholar at the UCSF's Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education.\nThe findings should also extend discussions around regulating non-cigarette tobacco products to include the risk they pose of leading adolescents to smoke cigarettes rather than only the harm the individual products may present, Watkins said.\nResearchers used data from the National Institutes of Health and Food and Drug Administration's Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health to track the responses of adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 from 2013 to 2015.\nThe study is believed to be the first to analyze all non-cigarette tobacco products. Others have focused on specific categories like e-cigarettes.\n\"I'm perhaps surprised about how similar the relationships were for each product across the board,\" Watkins said. \"I'm not surprised about the relationship, but the fact that we sliced this in as many ways as we could think of with all the methodological concerns folks had, no matter how we run the model, the results hold.\""}

Sister rallies were also planned in Britain, Japan and other countries. \n\"We will make our message heard at the polls this fall,\" Emily Patton, a rally organizer, told thousands of demonstrators at the Reflecting Pool on Washington's National Mall. \"That is why we are urging people to register to vote today.\" \nThe rallies also come during what has been seen as a pivotal year for women's rights with the #MeToo and #TimesUp social media effort against sexual harassment and abuse that was born out of a string of scandals in Hollywood, Washington and elsewhere. \nThe Washington rally featured Democratic politicians from neighboring Virginia, including Senator Tim Kaine, who blamed Trump and Republicans for the shutdown of the government on Saturday. \n\"The Trump shutdown is due to the inability of the Republican Party to do basic governing, like making a budget,\" he said to cheers. \nMany of the protesters wore pink knit \"pussy hats,\" which were created for last year's march as a reference to a comment made by Trump about female genitalia. The caps quickly became a symbol of women's empowerment and opposition to the new president in the early days of his administration. \n\"We want to continue the fight to resist this president and the policies we're against,\" said Sara Piper, 59, a geologist from Reston, Virginia. \nSome critics said this year's march lacked a focus. Targeting an issue such as immigration would have greater impact, said Shikha Dalmia, a senior analyst at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank. \n\"Beating the feminist drum just seems to me beside the point. Maybe they are trying to cast as wide a net as possible,\" Dalmia said by telephone. \nOne of the biggest marches is expected in New York, where 37,000 people had signed up on the march's Facebook page. But the number of participants in this year's rallies is likely to fall well short of the estimated 5 million who marched on Jan. 21, 2017, and made that one of the largest mass protests in U.S. history. \nIn Chicago, thousands of mostly female marchers gathered ahead of a rally in Grant Park, carrying signs that read \"Strong women raising strong women\" and \"You can't cure stupid but you can vote it out.\" \nMichelle Saunders, 41, a software saleswoman from Des Plaines, Illinois, came to the rally with her 14-year-old daughter Bailey. They attended last year's march and anticipated that the crowd this year would not match the 250,000 that attended last year, but for them the message is just as strong. \n\"A smaller crowd will not mean people are any less angry,\" Michelle Saunders said. \"We are unhappy with the current administration and what it stands for and want our voices to be heard.\" \nSince last year's march, women have become more vocal and that is a positive sign, said Cathy Mutz, 63, a retired nurse from Chanahan, Illinois. \n\"I think change will come from the midterm elections,\" she said. \nOrganizers hope to build on the energy felt by Trump opponents after his surprise election victory in 2016 and channel it into gains for progressive candidates in November's midterm elections, using the theme \"Power to the Polls.\" \nOrganizers want to register 1 million new voters and get more strong advocates for women's rights into office. \nActivists say Trump's policies rolling back birth control and equal pay protections have propelled many women into activism for the first time. In Virginia state legislative polls, 11 of the 15 Democrats elected were women. \nA White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the marches. \nThe marches will be followed by more events on Sunday, including in Las Vegas, a key battleground state in the 2018 midterm congressional elections. \nThe voter registration campaign will target swing states held by Republicans, such as Nevada, and in districts considered a toss-up ahead of November's midterm elections."}

In her acceptance speech, Winfrey reflected on her own life and career and addressed changes she says need to be made in the media industry.\n\"What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have.

She landed a gig hosting the then-stagnant morning talk show, \"AM Chicago\" and turned it into the number one local talk show within months.\nA year later, in 1986, the program was renamed, \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" It went on to become the highest-rated talk show in television history.

But while executives from Facebook , Google and Twitter have made multiple trips to testify in front of Congress, there's been no clear movement towards enforcement.\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff offered up an analogy: Treat social media like a health issue, similar to tobacco and sugar.\n\"I think that you do it exactly the same way that you regulated the cigarette industry. Here's a product: Cigarettes. They're addictive, they're not good for you,\" Benioff told CNBC's \" Squawk Alley \" on Tuesday. \"I think that for sure, technology has addictive qualities that we have to address, and that product designers are working to make those products more addictive and we need to rein that back.\"\nBenioff said that there's confusion about whether social media use is bad for people and it's the government's job to step in and provide clarity for parents. There's a smoking age for cigarettes and regulations around how they can be promoted, but no such rules exist for social media.\nFacebook has already taken steps to avoid the same fate as the tobacco industry. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has resolved to fix the issues with Facebook this year and significantly refocused the customer experience away from divisive news.\nRegulators are questioning whether Russian ads \u2014 viewed by millions of social media users \u2014 influenced the U.S. presidential election in 2016.\n\"We're the same as any other industry,\" Benioff said. Like, \"financial services, consumer product goods, food \u2014 in technology, the government's going to have to be involved. There is some regulation but there probably will have to be more.\"\nshow chapters Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff: There will have to be more regulation on tech from the government 3 Hours Ago | 07:05 Benioff was interviewed in Davos, Switzerland , the site of the World Economic Forum, where he discussed issues in Silicon Valley around tech culture, inequality and discrimination.\n\"I don't think it's fundamentally broken,\" Benioff said of the industry's culture. He said there are \"two worlds,\" one with companies driven by purpose, \"and then you have CEOs that are only focused on the product.\"\nBenioff was heralded as a top CEO for his leadership role at Salesforce, according to a survey by Comparably last year. And the tone at the top has been of special focus in Silicon Valley this year, as allegations around racial and gender discrimination have made headlines.\nBenioff said that he's had almost 20 years to observe the changes in Silicon Valley and, from the beginning, Salesforce has committed resources to a foundation as a multipronged approach to improving the world.\nStill, Benioff said, the tone at Davos is lighter among business leaders than in the post-recession years, noting a \"huge amount of exuberance\" among CEOs around the recent tax overhaul.\n\"The economic freight train is going to continue,\" he said."}

REUTERS\/Ammar Awad Israel has held Ahed Tamimi since arresting her three days after she was filmed punching the soldier at the entrance to her family home in a village in the occupied West Bank. The confrontation took place after what Israel says was a stone-throwing assault on its troops.\nThe case has made her into such a symbol for Palestinians that a commentator in Israeli left-wing newspaper Haaretz said Israel risked turning her into the \u201cPalestinian Joan of Arc\u201d.\nRight-wing Israelis, meanwhile, have debated whether the soldier had appeared weak by opting not to strike back. The Israeli army said he \u201cacted professionally\u201d by showing restraint.\nThe charge sheet against Tamimi, seen by Reuters, included counts of aggravated assault against a soldier, who the army said was bruised on his brow by her punch, obstructing a soldier in the performance of his duty and throwing stones at troops.\n\u201cTamimi threw stones at them (the soldiers), threatened them, obstructed them in fulfilling their duty, took part in riots and incited others to take part in them,\u201d the military said on its public affairs Twitter account.\nPalestinian teen Ahed Tamimi (C-R) speaks to her lawyer Gaby Lasky in the military courtroom at Ofer Prison, near the West Bank city of Ramallah, January 1, 2018.

The military court gave her lawyer more time to study the charges.\nAn adult found guilty of assaulting a soldier could be jailed for up to 10 years, but such an outcome would be unlikely for Tamimi as a minor.\nThe incident occurred at the entrance to Tamimi\u2019s family home in the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh, where weekly protests against Israeli settlement policy have been held for years. Tamimi\u2019s father is a prominent Palestinian activist.\nTamimi made news two years ago when she was pictured biting a soldier who tried to arrest her younger brother.

{"published":"2018-01-02T15:10:00.000+02:00","title":"The Swiss mountain man who sets the ultimate test","text":"(Reuters) - It\u2019s the ninth time he\u2019s designed the Olympic downhill ski course, but Bernhard Russi will still feel his nerves tauten when racing gets under way in South Korea next month.\nThe 69-year-old Swiss knows better than most the excitement of competing at the highest level. He won the Olympic title in 1972 and was narrowly beaten by Austria\u2019s Franz Klammer four years later - the closest any men\u2019s downhill champion has come to making a successful defense of his crown.\nFurther playing on his nerves, though, is the knowledge of the extreme risks faced by the men and women trying to conquer the course he has set.\n\u201cListen, I used to be a downhiller myself. This will never go away,\u201d Russi told Reuters. \u201cI will always be nervous because somewhere I am always also a little bit afraid, because I know too good that bad things can happen every moment, every time, every day.\u201d\nThe run-up to these Olympics has highlighted that danger, with the deaths of Frenchman David Poisson and German teenager Max Burkhart in the space of just several weeks in November and December.\nWhile Russi sees the timing as a tragic coincidence, the risk inherent in the sport is a constant.\nAs he talks about the job of designing courses, it\u2019s clear he sees one of his most vital roles as building in a safety margin for the athletes at the same time as guaranteeing a thrilling spectacle.\n\u201cI think in a good downhill I need at least three good jumps. I have to count that the jumps are probably 50 meters long, so I have to be careful that the landing zone is probably 70, 80 meters,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf I calculate that with the speed, and the edge and the steepness the racers will jump 50 meters, I have to give them an additional space of 10 to 20 meters for safely landing in case somebody misses the jump completely - then instead of jumping 45 meters he will fly for 70, and I have to make sure that if he makes this mistake he\u2019s not landing on the flat.\u201d\nSTARTING FROM ZERO The complexity of the course designer\u2019s task varies hugely from one Olympics to the next, depending on whether there is existing ski infrastructure on the mountain.\nThe Jeongseon site in South Korea is one of several where Russi has started from zero - when he first went there in 2001, there was \u201cnothing at all. There was a forest road until maybe half-way up and from there nothing, not even a cat walk.\u201d\nIt was after the Koreans were finally awarded the Games in 2011, at their third attempt, that the Swiss set to work. Since then, he estimates he has visited about 30 times.\nFILE PHOTO: A general view from the spectator seating area of the finish area of the Alpine Skiing events of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Rosa Khutor, February 3, 2014. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File photo The first step is to study the maps, assessing the contours and judging the steepness of the various possible descents. The second is to get his hiking boots on.\n\u201cI always say I walk the mountain in order to be able to listen to what the mountain is telling me... Especially in this case, I felt that here is a mountain which has a lot of changing terrains.\u201d\nThrough his exploration, Russi gets to know the steep and flatter portions, discover the edges and ridges.\n\u201cAfter I know that, I try to build up the story of the mountain. Is it a wild one, or is it a more technical one, or is it more speed or is it more air?\u201d\nSometimes he needs to modify the terrain, for example by filling in a hole or moving some earth to create an adequate landing zone.\nFILE PHOTO: Bernhard Russi of Switzerland, Olympic Downhill gold medalist of the 1972 Winter Olympic Games of Sapporo and designer of all Olympic Downhill courses since 1988 in Calgary, looks up at his new course in Rosa Khutor near Sochi before the first practice run for the men's Alpine Skiing World Cup Downhill race February 8, 2012. REUTERS\/Wolfgang Rattay\/File Photo But generally he aims to touch the mountain as little as possible. He\u2019s proud that for these Olympics, in the interest of sustainability, agreement was reached to build a single downhill course for men and women - something that hasn\u2019t been done before, but will be repeated when China hosts the Games in 2022.\nEXTRA DIFFICULTY After years of work, the time comes to test the course with the world\u2019s best skiers.

Now he's one of Trump's biggest opponents","text":"Before Donald Trump came along, Bill Kristol exemplified virtually all the leading elements of the modern Republican Party.\nAfter watching his father, Irving, help found the neoconservative movement, he joined the Reagan administration as an aide to Education Secretary William Bennett, a leading figure on the cultural right. Later, as chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle, he pressed President George H.W. Bush from the right on taxes.\nIn 1993, at the newly minted Project for the Republican Future, he helped direct the party's successful effort to block President Bill Clinton 's health-care plan. He launched the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard and became a commentator for Fox News. He staunchly backed President George W. Bush 's Iraq War and promoted Sarah Palin for the vice presidency in 2008.\nPat Anastasi | CNBC Bill Kristol speaks with CNBC'S John Harwood at the Mayflower Hotel's Edgar Bar & Kitchen in Washington, D.C. Now, at 65, Kristol has made a radical break. Alarmed at Trump's policies and methods, he has become a leading voice of Republican opposition. That has damaged old friendships and made new ones. Kristol now offers analysis on MSNBC. He is re-examining old assumptions about fellow conservatives and Republicans \u2014 and contemplating new possibilities for progress in the political center.\nWe talked over beers at the Mayflower Hotel near the White House \u2014 the same hotel where he and others decided a quarter-century ago to launch the magazine he still serves as editor-at-large. What follows is a condensed, edited transcript of our conversation.\nCNBC's John Harwood: Your dad once said that \"a neoconservative was a liberal who had been mugged by reality.\" What happened to you?\nBill Kristol: I'm a conservative who's been mugged by Trump. But I still think I'm a conservative. I'm trying to uphold what was true about conservatism. I consider myself a Reagan conservative.\nHarwood: You don't think your politics have changed?\nKristol: No, not much. I mean, pro-American leadership in the world. Anti-America First. Pro free trade pretty much. Moderate on immigration. Limited government, constitutional government.\nIn terms of the conservative movement, I do think it would be foolish to deny that Trump has exposed certain aspects of that movement as less healthy than I thought or hoped.\nHarwood: What has Trump exposed about conservatism?\nKristol: It's a big movement. So maybe one shouldn't be surprised. But there are parts that I think were suppressed before that have come more to the fore. Some bigotry, some close-mindedness, some intolerance, backward-looking aspects of the movement.\nTo the credit of the Republican Party and the conservative movement, people have been expelled or marginalized. Pat Buchanan in the '90s. Ron Paul, Rand Paul in the first decade of this century. Bill Buckley famously expelled the Birchers in 1964. It's been a movement that's tried to maintain its boundaries.\nBut it turned out there were elements there that Trump appealed to. He's an effective demagogue. And then the rationalization of Trump, acceptance of Trump by so many Republicans and some conservatives, including conservatives I worked with and respect, has been disturbing to me.\nHarwood: Through your father, who was part of a movement that had a big effect on the nature of the two-party system, you were present at the creation of the Democratic and Republican parties as we knew them to develop during our lifetimes. How would you chart that journey?\nKristol: There are obviously a lot of aspects and elements. But I just think Trump matters a lot. That is, as, if Trump had run in 2015 and lost the way other outside businessmen ran and lost, the way demagogues I would say like Buchanan or Ron Paul ran and lost, and Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush or Scott Walker or any of these people had been the nominee, I think anyone would have said, \"You know what? Actually, what's striking is the continuity of the party.\"\nIf he won the nomination and then lost, it could have been, \"OK, well, that was sort of a weird year. He lost.\" You just can't underestimate the importance of one person winning the nomination, and then especially winning the presidency, and especially then not accommodating to the norms that one expected a president to accommodate to.\nAnd then having so many people \u2014 senators, congressmen, some conservative leaders \u2014 deciding, \"OK, well, those norms didn't matter as much, and Trump won, so we're just signing on to a populist demagogue.\"\nRead more from John Harwood's interview with Bill Kristol:\nKristol on Sarah Palin\nKristol on businesses kissing up to Trump\nKristol on Fox News\nHarwood: You talked about bigotry. An important event in the development of the two parties as they exist today was the break that occurred in the mid-'60s when Barry Goldwater went one way and Lyndon Johnson went another on civil rights. Was that the origin of what became the Trump cultural appeal on immigration and on race?\nKristol: Yes, and clearly the party's more Southern. But I think it's unfair to say that for 50 years this has been sort of just racism or bigotry. There are absolutely legitimate arguments on some of these policy issues for limited government \u2014 not having racial preferences or limiting them in public institutions and so forth. One hoped those were arguments people were making on principle. Some of them, it turns out, were making them on bigotry.\nImmigration is the one that surprised me the most. I have no problem with a serious, positive debate. The undertones which have now become almost the overtones of that debate have been distressing. And unfortunately, in this case, it all kind of came together to become the mainstream of the party, at least for a while. Now if you pluck Trump out, would it go back to looking what it looked like? I mean, maybe.\nHarwood: Our politics may not snap back to what it was, just because he passes from the scene?\nKristol: I think it's unlikely. One almost never goes back to the way it was. You'd be in a new place, which maybe would be a good place.\nBut it could also be the case, unfortunately, that you are in a bit of a downward spiral here, and that Trump's incivility just leads to other incivility and that becomes the new norm. That you denigrate your opponents in personal terms in a way that really wasn't that common at the presidential level.\nThat as president, you attack individuals in the FBI as traitors. That you attack your own Cabinet members publicly. That you just demean.\nHarwood: There are a lot of boundaries that are getting crossed that were never crossed before.\nKristol: Absolutely. It's very hard to imagine you just snap your fingers and those boundaries magically reappear.\nHarwood: You were part of a movement that changed the establishment but ultimately became what one would call the Republican establishment. Do you feel at all responsible for the creation of the conditions that produced this?\nKristol: A little bit. It was a mistake to \u2014 I was critical of the 2013 immigration bill. The Iraq War didn't go the way I and many others hoped. It was reasonable of voters to say, \"Well, gee, that didn't work out too well. There were no weapons of mass destruction.\"\nThe 2008 financial crisis \u2014 that wasn't supposed to happen. Sarah Palin, one of my more famous failures, I guess you'd say. I thought Palin as McCain's VP would be a way to almost channel a certain kind of populism into what I would say is a healthy conservatism.\nI probably need to spend more time really thinking about what happened over the last three or four years. Having said all that, I do think one can over explain these things and over-interpret these things. Just Trump himself is a huge phenomenon.\nDemocracies have always been susceptible to demagoguery. That's why the founders wrote about demagogues. And it just turned out that Trump was a very effective demagogue coming along at the right time in the right circumstances. Didn't have to happen, but it happened.\nI don't think it necessarily reveals that the whole culture is totally bankrupt, or conservatism is deeply, fatally flawed, or we've degenerated into just a celebrity culture where anything goes, or we're post-truth. Having said that, once you have a president who has all these characteristics, then you do begin to move in that direction.\nHarwood: What's it been like for you, as someone steeped in a world that is now largely very pro-Trump, to be a high-profile critic of him? Have you had friendships that changed, or disappeared? What's it been like?\nKristol: It's been fine, honestly. It's a perfectly reasonable question to ask. It's been great being at The Weekly Standard, great being able to say my piece. I think I'm saying the right thing.\nThere have been friendships that are, they haven't been blowups, but they're people I see much less of than I saw two years ago. Other people whom I, you know, I strangely respect.\nHarwood: Are you goofing on Twitter when you say \"I'm with her,\" and\u2026\nKristol: \"My inner liberal\"\nHarwood: Yeah, all that stuff.\nKristol: Semi-goofing. I actually do think that there is a greater possibility for a centrism in reaction to Trump on the one hand and [Sen. Bernie] Sanders on the other.\nHarwood: You're becoming a third-way guy?\nKristol: I'm slightly more open to third way-ism than I was before. In the American context, it has its practical limits, and as an intellectual matter, you don't want to just be splitting the difference and all that. But would it be healthy for the country if there were more honest attempts to work out some deals on some issues, some compromises, and not to turn everything into a bloody trench warfare and an emblem of the culture war? Yes.\nThis is the great irony. I was involved in the \"reformicon\" effort in 2013-2014, which was explicitly, \"we can't just Xerox Reagan.\" In the spirit of Reagan actually we could rethink things \u2014 maybe we need to think more about job-training programs, earned income tax credit, adjust the tax code.\nThat all got blown up. What we now have is a weird combination of Trumpism and complacent Republican orthodoxy. The reforming spirit has disappeared for now. But I think it'll come back.\nHarwood: You think we're on the way to a new party?\nKristol: Less unlikely than I would have said two or three years ago. It never seems to quite happen. But I do think a Trump-Republican variety or Sanders-Warren Democratic Party leaves an unbelievable, huge opening in the middle for an independent presidential ticket.\nI don't know whether we get a new party, just some independent candidates, some reshuffling within the parties. It's a very fluid moment. I mean, it's such a cliche to say \"uncharted waters,\" but it really is. We've never had a president like Trump.\nDisclosure: MSNBC and CNBC are divisions of NBCUniversal."}

{"published":"2018-01-09T19:11:00.000+02:00","title":"COLUMN-Policy tightening? It's real rates that matter for markets: McGeever","text":"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\nBy Jamie McGeever\nLONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. and UK interest rates are rising, the European Central Bank is cutting back its bond purchases and even the Bank of Japan is hinting it will turn off the stimulus taps one day.\nWith rates rising and central banks no longer expanding their balance sheets, monetary policy around the world will tighten more in 2018 than any year since the crisis.\nYet the real cost of borrowing, taking inflation into account, remains low historically and perhaps dangerously low. Real interest rates across the developed world have been negative since October 2016, and look set to remain so for some time.\nThis is music to investors\u2019 ears. Negative real rates and yields play a huge part in keeping broader financial conditions loose, which in turn is powering the \u201cmelt up\u201d in financial assets.\nAccording to Goldman Sachs, financial conditions in the United States are looser now than when the Federal Reserve started raising rates in December 2015.\nDespite the Fed\u2019s five rate hikes in the last two years, real U.S. interest rates remain negative. Depending on which measure of inflation you use, real rates are as low as -0.5 percent.\nCountrary to the popular perception, Japanese real rates are the highest of all G4 central banks, while real 10-year bond yields in Britain are around the lowest they\u2019ve been for six years.\nNegative real borrowing costs add fuel to markets that are already on fire, limiting the downward pressure on bonds, keeping corporate spreads on the tight side and pushing stocks to new high after new high.\nBut when compared with real yields, stocks aren\u2019t \u201cparticularly expensive\u201d, according to the Bank for International Settlements. The slump in real yields since the crisis means the S&P 500\u2019s near 2.5 percent dividend yield remains tempting to investors.\nExchange rates should also be viewed through the prism of real, not nominal, rates and yields. They help explain why the yen has held up well despite the BOJ\u2019s aggressive easing and why sterling is still down more than 10 percent since the 2016 Brexit referendum even though UK rates are rising.\nBOOM TIME The problem with negative real rates at this current juncture is obvious - the world economy and financial markets are booming. Is that an environment that warrants negative interest rates?\nAsset price inflation is everywhere but consumer price inflation is pretty much nowhere to be seen, which is why central banks feel comfortable tightening policy so slowly.\nEven though the global economy is roaring, scars from 2007-09 still run deep, and there\u2019s a clear inclination among policymakers to go slowly and gradually with any rate hikes.\nThis understandable caution is reinforced by the rapid rise in global debt. According to the Institute of International Finance, global debt now exceeds $230 trillion, higher than it was before the crisis and a new all-time high.\nRising debt necessitates lower real borrowing costs for consumers to sustain consumption and living standards. But higher interest rates could make high debt levels unsustainable.\nFor investors, it\u2019s a chicken and egg scenario. They\u2019re crying out for policy \u201cnormalization\u201d - higher rates and less central bank \u201cinterference\u201d in markets - but are enjoying the asset price boom that\u2019s in large part a direct consequence of central bank largesse.\nIt\u2019s clear that a corner has been turned, however, and that the global tightening shift is underway and some increase in real rates is expected, especially if strong growth continues. But it\u2019s hard to see them getting much above zero, especially in the euro zone and Britain.\nWhile this remains the case, borrowing will continue to rise and the day of reckoning will inch closer. But as long as investors believe that day is far enough in the future distance, world markets may continue to boom.\nReporting by Jamie McGeever; Graphics by Saikat Chaterjee Editing by Jeremy Gaunt\n "}

But SPD officials have made no promises. \nPolicy papers prepared by Bavaria\u2019s CSU, sister party to Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, point to difficult negotiations ahead at a time when Merkel and others are calling for quick work to form a stable new government. \nThe CSU, historically more conservative than Merkel\u2019s larger party, will play a key role in the coalition talks. The two conservative parties have presented a more unified front in recent months after prolonged conflict over Merkel\u2019s decision in 2015 to welcome more than one million migrants to Germany. \nIn a paper leaked last week, the CSU said it wanted military spending to reach NATO\u2019s target of 2 percent of national output, called for a hardline position on immigration, and rejected closer European integration, charting a collision course with the SPD. \nNow, draft policy papers prepared for a CSU party meeting this week set up further conflicts. \nIn one paper, first reported by German magazine Focus, the CSU calls for cuts in corporate tax rates, given U.S. tax cuts and similar moves afoot in Britain and France. \n\u201cIf Germany does not act, it will in the near future have one of the highest corporate tax rates in international comparison,\u201d the paper said. \nSPD parliamentary group leader Andrea Nahles has called for increasing taxes on the wealthy. Her party is pressing for more spending on infrastructure, education, health care and other social priorities. \nAnother CSU paper called for cuts in benefits for asylum seekers to discourage more migrants from coming to Germany, the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper reported late on Monday. \nInstead of transitioning to higher regular welfare payments after 15 months, asylum-seekers would continue to receive the lower basic aid for 36 months. \n\u201cWe want to reduce social welfare payments for asylum seekers so that Germany does not remain the main magnet for refugees from the whole world,\u201d Alexander Dobrindt, a top CSU official told the newspaper. \nPressure is mounting on Merkel to form a new government three months after the election. \nFormer finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, now president of the lower house of parliament, said on Saturday he could not rule out a minority government if no deal emerged. \nAnother alternative would be a new election, but political experts say that could result in further gains for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which parlayed concerns about migration to enter parliament for the first time in September.

Company office towers and high-end eateries have taken the place of warehouses and parking lots in Seattle\u2019s South Lake Union district. The Spheres complex, officially open to workers on Tuesday, is the pinnacle of a decade of development here. \nThe Spheres\u2019 three glass domes house some 40,000 plants of 400 species. Amazon, famous for its demanding work culture, hopes the Spheres\u2019 lush environs will let employees reflect and have chance encounters, spawning new products or plans. \nThe space is more like a greenhouse than a typical office.

DAY TWO OF THE ANNUAL J.P. MORGAN HEALTHCARE CONFERENCE IN SAN FRANCISCO. OUR OWN MEG TIRRELL IS THERE, AND SHE HAS A VERY \u2013 I'M GOING TO SAY VERY SPECIAL GUEST, MEG. TAKE IT AWAY.\nMEG TIRRELL: HE IS VERY SPECIAL, DAVID, THANKS SO MUCH. JOINING US IS ALEX GORSKY, THE CEO AND CHAIRMAN OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON. THANK FOR BEING HERE ALEX.\nALEX GORSKY: HEY, GOOD MORNING MEG. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE WITH YOU.\nTIRRELL: ONE OF THE BIG THEMES OF THE CONFERENCE ALWAYS IS M & A, IS DEALS, AND OF COURSE, WITH THE TAX OVERHAUL JUST PASSED, YOU GUYS HAVE $16 BILLION IN OVERSEAS CASH, WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO WITH THAT? ANALYSTS ARE INDICATING MAYBE PAY DOWN DEBT IS JOB NUMBER ONE, BUT ARE YOU GOING TO BE RE-INVESTING THAT, ARE YOU GOING TO BE HIRING, ARE YOU GOING TO INVESTING IN RESEARCH?\nGORSKY: WELL, MEG, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S GREAT TO BE AT THIS CONFERENCE. I MEAN THIS IS ABOUT TEN YEARS IN A ROW I HAVE BEEN OUT HERE. AND WHAT A WAY TO START THE YEAR, BECAUSE YOU COME OUT HERE AND YOU HEAR, IT'S REALLY ALL \u2013 NOT NECESSARILY ALL ABOUT DEALS BUT IT'S ABOUT INNOVATION, IT'S ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGY, AND ALL THE REPORTING OUT OF THE PREVIOUS INTERVIEWS YOU HAVE DONE, YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT THINGS LIKE IMMUNO ONCOLOGY, BREAKTHROUGHS, CURES WE COULDN'T HAVE EVEN IMAGINED, YOU KNOW, 10, 20 YEARS AGO. THESE THINGS ARE ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN OUR INDUSTRY SO IT'S A GREAT TIME TO BE HERE. LOOK, AT JOHNSON & JOHNSON, WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR GREAT NEW THERAPIES. WE TRY TO BE AGNOSTIC ABOUT WHETHER WE SOURCE IT INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY. AND I MUST ADMIT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS RIGHT HERE AT THIS CONFERENCE, WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MEET NEW PARTNERS, SEE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND SEE NEW EARLY SCIENCE THAT WE'VE ULTIMATELY BEEN ABLE TO BRING TO THE MARKET AND MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR PATIENTS. AS IT RELATES TO THE TAX, WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SEE THE TAX REFORM WENT THROUGH. I THINK THE FACT WE NOW HAVE A COMPETITIVE TAX RATE, THAT WE HAVE A CONSTRUCT IN PLACE TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS AND CASH FROM OVERSEAS IS GOING TO GIVE US MUCH MORE FLEXIBILITY, MAKE US MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE. IN TERMS OF HOW WILL IT FUNDAMENTALLY AFFECT OUR OVERALL M & A STRATEGY, I DON'T THINK IT REALLY WILL. BECAUSE REALLY THAT STARTS WITH SCIENCE, THE RIGHT DEAL, THE RIGHT COMPANY, THE RIGHT CULTURE BEING ABLE TO INTEGRATE IT IN, BUT IT CERTAINLY GIVES US MORE FLEXIBILITY AND IS GOING TO MAKE US MORE COMPETITIVE IN THE LONG RUN.\nTIRRELL: WELL, YOUR PHARMA BUSINESS OF COURSE IS YOUR LARGEST UNIT. YOU ALSO HAVE A WELL KNOWN CONSUMER SET OF BRANDS, BUT THAT ONE OPERATIONALLY NOT DOING AS WELL. DOWN ABOUT 15% I BELIEVE IN THE THIRD QUARTER. ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT BOLSTERING THAT THROUGH M & AT ALL? PFIZER IS TALKING ABOUT OPTIONS FOR ITS CONSUMER BUSINESS.\nGORSKY: LOOK WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS. AND YOU KNOW, OUR CONSUMER SEGMENT, THAT'S REALLY BEEN A CORE, ICONIC BRAND FOR JOHNSON & JOHNSON, WHETHER IT'S BABY, WHETHER IT'S NEUTROGENA, AVEENO, TYLENOL, WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT FRANCHISES. AND WHILE THEY DID PERFORM DOWN SLIGHTLY, THEY WERE ACTUALLY ABOUT FLAT IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF THE YEAR. WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS REALLY A SECULAR SHIFT THROUGHOUT THE LARGE CONSUMER BRANDS OVERALL. NOW, WE REMAIN VERY CONFIDENT IN THAT FRANCHISE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING GROWTH IN AREAS LIKE BEAUTY, LIKE OTC, IT STILL REMAINS STRONG. WE CERTAINLY HAVE GOT TO DO THINGS ABOUT MODERNIZING SOME OF OUR BRANDS AROUND BABY, MOVING EVEN FASTER TO THE E-CHANNEL, BUT OVERALL WE'RE VERY CONFIDENT. AND AGAIN, HERE, TOO, WE DID AN ACQUISITION JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO, VOGUE, A REALLY GOOD INNOVATIVE HAIR CARE COMPANY, AND WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS WE'RE ACTUALLY TAKING THE WAY THEY INNOVATE IN A FAST WAY, WHERE THEY'RE COLLECTING ONLINE IMMEDIATELY WITH CONSUMERS AND WE'RE BUILDING THAT INTO SOME OF OUR OTHER BRANDS IN THE CONSUMER AREA. SO YOU KNOW, M & A IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR STRATEGY.\nTIRRELL: WELL, THINKING ABOUT E-COMMERCE, A BIG QUESTION IN 2017 IN HEALTH CARE WAS THE PRESENCE OF AMAZON. AND OF COURSE, YOU MAY HAVE PARTNERSHIPS AND EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM IN YOUR CONSUMER BUSINESS. WHAT'S YOUR EXPECTATION FOR THEIR POTENTIAL MOVE INTO THE PHARMACY SUPPLY CHAIN?\nGORSKY: WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT AMAZON IS WE HAVE A VERY GOOD PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM ON THE CONSUMER SIDE. AND WE'RE TALKING TO THEM, WE SELL THROUGH MANY OF THE BIG CHAINS WE WORK WITH. WE ALSO SELL DIRECTLY. BUT WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALMOST ANYBODY, WHETHER IT BE IN PHARMA, MED DEVICE, OTC, WE SHOULD ALL BE ACTING LIKE AMAZON'S GETTING INTO OUR BUSINESS. BECAUSE FRANKLY, WE HAVE TO CREATE A CRISIS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALWAYS COMPETITIVE, WE'RE ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN WE BE MORE EFFECTIVE, HOW CAN WE BE MORE EFFICIENT. AND SO WE'RE THINKING THAT WAY ACROSS ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT BUSINESSES.\nTIRRELL: WOULD YOU WELCOME AMAZON IN ARE YOU TALKING WITH THEM ABOUT THEIR ROLE?\nGORSKY: WELL, IF IT LEADS TO BETTER CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, IF IT LEADS TO GREATER TRANSPARENCY, FOR EXAMPLE, AROUND PRICING, IF IT LEADS TO ULTIMATELY BETTER OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS, OF COURSE, WE WELCOME THEM IN.\nTIRRELL: ANY CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING?\nGORSKY: WELL I WON'T GO DOWN THAT ROAD RIGHT NOW, BUT LOOK, I THINK HAVING HEALTHY COMPETITION CAN BE A POSITIVE THING. BUT YOU KNOW, WE'VE ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP THE PATIENT, THE CONSUMER IN MIND.\nTIRRELL: WELL I WANT TO ASK YOU MORE BROADLY ABOUT THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW. AND A BIG DEBATE GOING ON OUTSIDE THIS CONFERENCE IS THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE AND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH DACA AND D.R.E.A.M.ers. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES THIS MORNING INTERVIEWED A J & J EMPLOYEE WHO IS A D.R.E.A.M.er AND SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT BEING EXPELLED FROM THE COUNTRY. SHE SAYS SHE'S TALKED WITH YOU ABOUT JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S POSITION ON DACA. HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT FOR JOHNSON & JOHNSON?\nGORSKY: WELL LOOK, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND IT'S IMPORTANT AT A PERSONAL LEVEL. AS THE GRANDSON OF IMMIGRANTS MYSELF, IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR COUNTRY. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'VE GOT COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM THAT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION, YOU KNOW, HOW CAN WE HELP THESE PEOPLE YOU KNOW, GAIN THE RIGHT \u2013 THEIR APPROPRIATE RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES? HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THEY CAN BE DRIVERS OF THE ECONOMY? THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. SO IT'S CERTAINLY OUR HOPE. WE'VE MADE A STAND ON DACA. IT'S OUR HOPE WE CAN, AGAIN, GET MORE COMPREHENSIVE REFORM THROUGH. AND WE WANTED TO HELP OUR EMPLOYEES, LIKE THE ONE YOU TALKED TO THIS MORNING. IN FACT, WE THINK IT'S GOOD FOR ALL OF INDUSTRY WHEN THAT GETS DONE.\nTIRRELL: DAVID, YOU HAVE A QUESTION?\nFABER: YEAH, THANK YOU, MEG. A"}

The study was published online January 2 in Nature Communications.\nIn previous work, the team identified a group of early cancer cells that get disseminated into the body during the earliest stages of breast cancer, before any cancer can be detected.\nIn the current study, they report that immune cells called macrophages play an important part in this process. Working in mice and in human cells in the laboratory, the team found that dissemination occurs when macrophages are attracted to the milk ducts, where they trigger a chain reaction that enables the early cancer cells to leave the breast.\n\u201cWe show that by disrupting this (process), we can prevent early dissemination and, ultimately, deadly metastasis,\u201d Aguirre-Ghiso said in an email to Reuters Health.\n\u201cOur study challenges the dogma that early diagnosis and treatment means sure cure,\u201d he said.\nIt could also be a \u201cstarting point\u201d for a test that could identify patients with the earliest form of breast cancer, known as ductal cell carcinoma in situ, who may already have disseminated disease, he suggested.\nFuture work will involve identifying the type of macrophages involved in early dissemination and exactly how the process occurs, which potentially could lead to the development of novel therapies to prevent it.\nThe kind of large, double-blind clinical trial that could prove this approach is still far in the future, Aguirre-Ghiso noted.\n\u201cEven so,\u201d he said, \u201cour findings point to the notion that early treatment of high-risk patients may prevent the formation of deadly metastasis better than the current standard of treating metastatic disease (only after it has appeared).\u201d\nCancer geneticist and researcher Dr. Theodora Ross of UT Southwestern in Dallas told Reuters Health by email, \u201cThe concept that macrophages are assisting in early metastases is so intriguing.\u201d But for now, she cautioned, \u201cthe extension of this hypothesis to humans remains speculative.\u201d\nHowever, \u201cthe point that patients with small \u2018early\u2019 breast cancers are not necessarily cured (by early treatment) is a good one,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat if metastases happen way before you ever see the cancer on a screening test?\u201d\n(This version of the story fixes date in source link at end of story from 2017 to 2018)\nSOURCE: go.nature.com\/2A6Funy Nature Communications, online January 2, 2018.\n "}

This includes e-commerce search and video products too .\nSources also told CNBC this week that Amazon is in talks with large companies about letting them promote products on the Echo smart speaker devices via the voice assistant Alexa.\nThe news shows how Amazon is gearing up for a big year of advertising.\nAmazon currently has three main types of ad products. The first is sponsored product ads which appear when you search for an item on Amazon. The second is headline search ads which also display in search results at the top of the page. And the final one is a standard product display ad paid for by a company.\nMizuho said it hosted an investor call with Merkle RKG, a marketing and data platform. Based on Merkle's studies, Mizuho said search appears to be the \"biggest opportunity\" in advertising for Amazon \"given its scale and the potential to increase pricing.\"\nBut the investment bank said that Amazon's advertising technology is still in its \"early development stage so it is well behind that of Google.\" For example, Mizuho said Amazon's customer targeting products are not up to scratch yet and therefore monetization is harder.\n\"That said, we believe that Amazon has plenty of headroom to improve its performance and monetization,\" Mizuho analyst James Lee wrote in the note.\nshow chapters Amazon has big plans for Alexa ads in 2018 1:19 PM ET Tue, 2 Jan 2018 | 00:55 Amazon's advertising push puts it in competition with the likes of Google and Facebook , both of which currently dominate the digital ad space. In the U.S., Google and Facebook are expected to rake in 63.1 percent of digital ad investment in 2017, according to eMarketer. In a report from March, eMarketer also forecast that Google's share of the search ad market could grow to more than 80 percent by 2019 .\nAnd Mizuho said that Amazon is unlikely to threaten the search business for Google.\n\"We do not expect the emergence of Amazon's ad business to threaten Google's search business. Merkle is seeing very little overlap between Amazon's ad customers and Google's. In addition, the use case for Amazon and Google's search is very different,\" Lee wrote in the note.\nThe investment bank said it maintains its \"buy\" rating on Amazon's stock with a price target of $1,300, which if realized, would represent a 9.3 percent rise from Tuesday's close."}

That would be more than twice the European average with which the European Central Bank wants to bring Italian lenders in line. \nDaily la Repubblica reported last month Intesa was under pressure by the ECB and was considering a spin-off of the bad loan unit and a sale of a 10-15 billion euro portfolio. \nBloomberg News on Wednesday reported the unit could be worth 500 million euros. \nSales of bad debts are normally carried out at a loss because market prices, although rising on good demand, are still below book values. \nIntesa said any sale would not affect its pledge to pay out 3.4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) in cash dividends this year. \nTo help cushion losses from disposals, several lenders - including in December Banca Carige ( CRGI.MI ) - have spun off units which would require investments they can ill afford. \n\u201cIn 2018 I expect more of these \u2018carve out\u2019 deals, in which banks sell their bad loan platforms,\u201d said Roberto Sergio, who heads bad loan think-tank Credit Village after selling the debt collector he founded to Polish group KRUK KRU.WA. \nForeign investors have been snapping up debt recovery firms in Italy, whose banks sit on 300 billion euros in soured loans. \n\u201cThe string of acquisitions has left very few possible targets on the market, while banks\u2019 bad loan units can provide buyers with precious skills.\u201d Additional reporting by Gianluca Semeraro, editing by Alexander Smith and David Evans"}

Approximately $0.3 million of performance-based incentive fees were voluntarily waived by the Company\u2019s investment manager for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.7 million of management fees and performance-based incentive fees waived in Q3 2017. The reduced fee waiver in Q4 2017 is a direct result of the Company generating higher gross investment income due to its net portfolio growth as well as an increase in the weighted average portfolio yield primarily attributable to its recent acquisition of North Mill Capital LLC.\nManagement expects the Company\u2019s net asset value per share at December 31, 2017 to be in the range of $16.81 to $16.84 compared to the net asset value per share of $16.81 as of September 30, 2017.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company\u2019s comprehensive portfolio activity 1 includes investments of approximately $85 million and prepayments and other exits of approximately $52 million. In addition, management expects the Company\u2019s net debt\/equity ratio to be approximately 0.45x at December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had no investments on non-accrual.\nOn October 24, 2017, the Company announced that it acquired 100% of the equity interests of North Mill Capital LLC (\u201cNorth Mill\u201d). North Mill is a leading asset-based lending commercial finance company that provides senior secured asset-backed financings to U.S. based small-to-medium sized businesses primarily in the manufacturing, services and distribution industries. The acquisition further diversifies and expands the Company\u2019s senior secured direct lending investment channels, provides differentiated sources of growth, and increases the earnings power of Solar Senior\u2019s portfolio.\nAdditionally, on January 5, 2018, the Board declared a distribution of $0.1175 per share for the month of January 2018.

She also offers some major warning signs that your personality might not be the best fit for your job. \nIn her book \" The Four Tendencies, \" Rubin poses a new personality framework which separates all people into one of four categories based on a simple question: \"How do you respond to expectations?\" \n\"It can help to know your own tendency because it can allow you to understand why your situation may not be working out,\" Rubin tells CNBC Make It . \"When you understand your tenancy, it does shed light on why certain circumstances might or might not favor that aspect of your nature.\" A post shared by Gretchen Rubin (@gretchenrubin) on Jun 10, 2017 at 2:34pm PDT \nRubin has an online quiz to assess your tendency. Here are her \"Four Tendencies\" based on how you respond to inner and outer expectations: Upholders: You readily meet both outer expectations and inner expectations. You meet your work deadlines and you keep your New Year's resolutions without much fuss. You prioritize what others expect from you and your expectations for yourself because both are equally important to you. Questioners: You question all expectations because you don't like doing anything arbitrary, inefficient or irrational. You will meet outer expectations only if you think it makes sense and as a result, turn everything into an inner expectation. Obligers: You respond readily to outer expectations but struggle to meet your own inner expectations.You work well when held accountable by others, but you find it difficult to accomplish your expectations for yourself. Rebels: You resist all expectations, outer and inner alike. You do only what you want to do, in your own way and in your own time. If someone asks or tells you to do something, you're very likely to resist. \nBased on Rubin's framework and advice, here are some warning signs you're in a workplace that's rubbing your personality tendency the wrong way. Upholder \nYour boss or coworkers think you're too rigid or too inflexible. Your work environment does not respect your desire to execute a plan. Instead, it penalizes you for wanting to move forward. \nRubin notes that if you're being told that sticking to the script and moving forward with a plan doesn't work in your office, then something about your upholder tendency is not matching with your workplace. \n\"In many workplaces, that would be very, very valued,\" Rubin says. Questioner \n\"If your workplace is telling you that you ask too many questions, it's probably not giving you the robust justification that you need as an upholder,\" Rubin says. \nSome responses your manager may give you in response to your questioner tendency include: \"We've always done it this way\" \"I'm your boss and this is what I say\" \"This is what corporate is telling us to do\" \"Just get with the program and follow through\" \nAs a questioner in search of answers, these types of responses are sure to rile you up. \nAnother warning sign is if you feel like what you're doing seems unjustified or an inefficient use of your time. show chapters 1:40 PM ET Tue, 6 June 2017 | 01:25 Obliger \nRubin says there are two specific warning signs to keep an eye on as an obliger. On the one hand, you may feel like your manager is too hands off and you're not getting the accountability you need. As a result, you stall out and don't accomplish all that you hope to because you \"don't have the outer accountability that would allow you to thrive,\" Rubin says. \nOn the other hand, if expectations are too heavy and you feel overwhelmed, you may fall into what Rubin calls \"obliger rebellion.\" After accepting and taking on too many responsibilities, an obliger will rebel by not doing any of the tasks, like refusing to answer email and engaging in more counterproductive activities. \n\"If you have that feeling that no one else is listening to you or you feel everyone expects you to do everything all the time, this is a sign that this job isn't working out for you,\" Rubin says. Rebel \nIf your job isn't a good fit for you as a rebel, you may find yourself thinking, \"I'm being controlled\" \"I'm being told what to do,\" \"I'm not being allowed to do work in my own way and not being allowed to make choices,\" according to Rubin. \nWhen you start feeling that someone else is trying to control or micromanage over you, you'll feel less accommodated in your workplace \n\"For rebels, it's all about choice and freedom,\" Rubin says."}

{"published":"2018-01-12T21:48:00.000+02:00","title":"Amazon's latest patents are focused on video, augmented reality and the connected home","text":"4 Hours Ago | 01:42 \nAmazon has about 500 patents pending. Of course, not all of them will form the basis of products, but Amazon has had some very notable patents -- like one-click shopping and many of the technologies that make up the foundation of cloud computing, now its most profitable business. \nSo we looked at some recent patent issues to get into the head of Bezos -- and see if we could find some clues about the inventions and technologies Amazon might be looking at next. \nWith the help of MCAM, a analytics firm that measures companies intellectual property we looked at a few patents issued over the last month. Some of them could be straight out of Black Mirror, the Netflix series that explores a high-tech near future. And when you look at activity overall, some themes emerge. MCAM analysis reveals that Amazon is ramping up patent activity in video, connected home and AR technologies. Augmented reality mirror \nIn December, Amazon was issued patents that include an augmented reality mirror and a \"smart\" sensor-studded package delivery air vehicle, as well as patents that include technology that would \"mute\" the Echo's video mode by pixelization for user privacy and detect hacked self driving cars. \nAs Amazon moves deeper into the fashion world, an augmented reality mirror would bring that world into customers' homes. It allows users to try on virtual clothes in a virtual setting, using a system of cameras, mirrors, projectors and lights to project different backgrounds and clothes onto the user. \nAmazon's Echo Look camera is already halfway there -- letting users take a picture with the help of Amazon's Alexa AI voice assistant, and use that to virtually try on different outfits. The company may be looking for ways to blend the Echo Look technology with its other recent fashion forays, like its own clothing, handbag and shoe labels and its Stitch Fix-like at-home clothing trial service. \nAlso in December, Amazon filed a patent for technology that would detect hacked self-driving cars. While Amazon has never said they are getting into autonomous driving, the patent could be hugely important for bigger players in this space like Tesla, Alphabet and Uber. \nAnother notable patent issued in the last month could advance video technology in Amazon's Echo devices. The technology allows users to use video conferencing on their Echo and mute it by blurring or pixelating the video for user privacy. This one suggests that Amazon is thinking of privacy protections as it ramps up video communication. A strong history of patents \nWhile many of Amazon's thousands of patents may never come to fruition, experts say that Amazon has very notable successes in terms of developing and protecting core patented technology. \nFor example, long before cloud computing was a mainstream enterprise practice -- and long before Google or Microsoft entered the space -- Amazon was getting patents issued relating to advanced cloud management and deployment. \n\"That strategy very much empowered their business strategy to allow them to have a huge lead in cloud,\" says David Pratt, Managing Director at MCAM. \"In turn,\" he says, \"it made it more complex and costly for competitors to stand up their cloud capability.\" Amazon's cloud unit, AWS, is now the company's most profitable business. \nAmazon's patent for one-click shopping, which lets customers buy things without entering and re-entering their billing, payment or shipping information, was issued in 1999. That patent gave it an edge over other retailers and reaped dividends through licensing fees from the likes of Apple and others. It expired last year, but for nearly 20 years, Amazon was the only game in town for a technology many consumers now take for granted. \nGaston Kroub, a founding partner at IP litigation boutique Kroub, Silbersher & Kolmykov, says that Amazon \"struck gold\" with one-click by getting a seminal ecommerce patent. With cloud computing, he says Amazon got in early \"in what proved to be a very important business unit and that gave them a competitive advantage. \nTo date Amazon has over 6,100 patents issued by the U.S., Europe and World Intellectual Property Organization. But in the business of patents, experts say it's not about numbers, but having the best quality patents that aim to enable and extend a company's business model. And in that regard, Pratt says, Amazon has one of the richest patent portfolios among the Fortune 500. \nKroub says that while Bezos has been proactive and smart about getting patents, part of his success comes from the era in which the company grew up. \n\"It helped that Amazon came of age at a time when there was a real land rush to patent technologies around software and business practices,\" Kroub says. \"During the dotcom boom, there was a huge rush in the patent office to grab as many as possible. Amazon was part of that wave and developed good habits on the patent front.\""}

LNG imports alone surged more than 50 percent.\nThe data, which includes LNG tanker arrivals to China and pipeline monthly import flow estimates, is preliminary as December figures are not yet available.\nChina still lags Japan, with gas annual imports of around 83.5 million tonnes, all as LNG, but its overall gas imports topped Japan's in September and again in November, government data and shipping flows show.\nAnalysts say the trend is set and China should top Japan for the full year in 2018.\n\"Both LNG and pipeline imports will continue to increase in the next few years. We expect China to overtake Japan as the world's largest gas importer in 2018,\" said Miaoru Huang, Asia gas and LNG senior manager at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.\n\"But Japan will remain as the No.1 LNG importer till around 2028,\" she added.\nChina last year started to move millions of households and many industrial facilities from coal to gas as part of efforts to clean its skies, sparking an unprecedented rally in overseas import orders.\nChina's three biggest LNG suppliers are Australia, Qatar and Malaysia, while pipeline imports come from Central Asia and Myanmar. A pipeline connecting China to Russia is under construction.\nUnlike established LNG importers which import the bulk of their cargoes under long-term contracts with fixed monthly volumes and a link to the oil market, many Chinese utilities buy LNG in the spot market when they need it at short notice, such as the current peak demand winter season.\nAs a result, Asian spot LNG prices have more than doubled since June to $11.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their highest since November 2014, making LNG one of 2017's strongest performing commodities.\nChina's surging demand already pushed it past South Korea in 2017 as the world's number 2 LNG importer."}

Sometimes you really like three candidates \u2014 that's a very tough position to be in. But we have places where I like all of the candidates,\" Trump said. \"But I will be very much involved with \u2014 beyond the primaries \u2014 with the election itself, very very much.\"\nTrump is scheduled to travel to western Pennsylvania on Thursday in support of Rick Saccone, the Republican candidate in a special election to replace Republican U.S. Representative Tim Murphy, who resigned in October amid a sex scandal.\nTrump said he is traveling to Pennsylvania to give Saccone his \"total support.\"\nTrump tweet \nThirty-four seats in the Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives will be contested in November's midterm elections. Democrats need to add a net total of two seats to assume control of the 100-seat Senate and 24 seats to take over the House.\nFractious Republican primary battles already are developing in states including Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin, where some of the candidates are backed by Steve Bannon , Trump's former chief political strategist who he fired last August.\nBefore Bannon had a public falling-out with the president over the former adviser's comments in a new book about the Trump White House, the expectation had been that Bannon's involvement might tempt Trump to interject himself into some those fights.\nNow that appears much less likely.\nSelling the tax bill Trump said he will tout during the campaign the Republican-backed tax overhaul law passed by Congress last month that slashed taxes for corporations and the rich while offering a mixed bag of tax changes to other Americans, a measure he argued would grow in popularity with voters as they see their taxes reduced in pay checks.\nThe bill also opened up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to private oil drilling and repealed a provision of the Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, that imposed a fine on people who did not obtain health insurance.\n\"Those were very, very big things,\" the president said. \"I think they'll be very, very popular on the campaign trail.\"\nHe also plans to tout the performance of the stock market.\n\"If the Democrats won the election, the stock market would have gone down 50 percent from where it was,\" Trump said.\nTrump's help could cut both ways for Republicans. In Reuters\/Ipsos polls, Trump's approval rating nationally has largely remained below 40 percent. His presence on the campaign trail could boost turnout of Democratic voters who want to register their disapproval of him.\nDemocrats won an upset victory in conservative Alabama last month after Roy Moore, the candidate who beat Trump-backed incumbent Senator Luther Strange in the primary and was later backed by the president, lost to Democrat Doug Jones.\nIn November, Trump-backed Republican candidate Ed Gillespie lost the Virginia governor's race to Democrat Ralph Northam.\nTrump can help Republicans in other ways than campaigning. He remains the party's most prodigious fundraiser."}

Dog DNA tests have emerged on the market as a way to find out about more about your furry companion and where they came from. \nIt might seem silly to run a genetic test on your pets \u2013 after all, they're not going to care about the results \u2013 but when you adopt a dog, you're often left wondering about the life they led before they became a permanent member of your family. Ancestry tests can also help you anticipate health concerns typical of certain dog breeds. The DNA subjects \nMy husband and I have a 9-year-old dog named Roscoe Jenkins and a (probably) 1-year-old dog named Amy Ruth. \nIn 2010, I moved into my first solo apartment, and to keep up with the adulting process I wanted to get a dog. After looking on rescue sites and shelters, I stumbled across a Craigslist post from an owner in the Bronx who was looking to get rid of her 2-year-old dog. Not only did he look like he fit the bill, his name was Roscoe. Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles was my favorite restaurant when I went to college in Los Angeles, so I took it as a sign. \nDespite his quirks and medical maladies \u2013 he can't eat grains, beef or chicken without scratching off his fur, he went blind because of a genetic disease about a year after I got him, and he's had to get many of his teeth removed \u2013 I quickly fell in love. More than seven years later, he's still by our side. \nI tracked down the original owner who told me he's a Yorkipoo. But no one else believed it -- the average Yorkipoo ranges from 3 to 14 pounds, much lighter than Roscoe's 18 pounds. Roscoe doesn't shed so we always thought he was some kind of poodle mix. He loves to take toys and shake them to death, which we were told was terrier behavior. People on the street most often think he's a West Highland Terrier-poodle mixt. \nWe wanted to add another dog, so in October 2017, we started fostering a skinny 12-pound rescue dog with the original name of Lil' Booger. She was between 1 and 2 and had just given birth to a litter of puppies. She also came with the note \"REALLY shy but adorable. Needs help with confidence.\" She had never walked on a leash, and didn't know how to play with toys. After fostering her for a few weeks, we decided to keep her and rename her Amy Ruth after my favorite fried chicken and waffles place in Harlem. \nWe thought she looked like a Chihuahua, but she's definitely much larger than the average 3 to 7 pounds. She also has ridiculously long legs for her size and is an incredible jumper, so maybe she had rat terrier in her. We then saw a Xoloitzcuintli but with hair (otherwise known as a Mexican hairless dog), and decided that was the closest to what she looked like. Amy Ruth (left) and Roscoe Jenkins the day they met. The test \nI purchased the Wisdom Panel 4.0 online from the website, which usually costs $84.99. (I got a Black Friday discount.) It claims to be able to identify more than 250 dog breeds and track your dog's ancestry up to three generations. \nThe test itself was pretty easy. You rip the box open, register the ID online, fill out basic information on the box with a pen, use two swabs to swab the inside of your dog's cheek and gums, let it dry, pack everything up, seal it up with pre-placed adhesive, and mail it out with the pre-paid postage. \nThe company notifies you when it receives the test via email. You then get a link to a website where you can check the test's progress. It took about three weeks. The results \nThe results include a page with a snippet of your dog's unique DNA code. The next section then shows you your dog's ancestry, followed by a little description of the breeds that make up your dog. The final section, titled \"health and traits,\" shows you if your dog has the genetic markers for multidrug sensitivity, exercise-induced collapse, and approximates your dog's weight based on its breeds, and what the genetic trait markers show your dog looks like. Roscoe Jenkins \nWe learned that Roscoe was actually a Yorkipoo, for the most part! He was 50 percent Yorkshire terrier, 25 percent miniature poodle and 25 percent mixed-breed terrier and sporting dogs. The test can only go back three generations, so for dogs that may have a ton of other breeds mixed in the results give you a \"mixed-breed\" category and tell you which kinds of dogs are in their ancestry. He was predicted to be about 8 to 17 pounds, so it was pretty accurate. Amy Ruth \nAmy was a quarter Chihuahua, a quarter Rat Terrier, a quarter Australian Cattle Dog (a total surprise) and a quarter of \"mixed-breeds\" from terrier, companion and herding backgrounds. In other words, she's got a little bit of everything. She was predicted to be between 19 and 33 pounds. While she's definitely gaining weight, I don't know if she'll hit that range. \nThe one thing I did find strange is some of reported traits did not line up with what my dogs looked like, especially Roscoe. For example, his ears flop down but according to the genetic test they \"could be prick or upright.\" He also was supposed to have a saddle tan pattern of dark pigment on his back, but he's pretty much beige. \nWisdom Panel lead researcher Angela Hughes pointed out Roscoe's miniature poodle breed often carries the \"prick\" allele, but doesn't always express it. It usually results in \"base-erect\" ears, which stand up at some point then flop over, instead of fully dropped ears. (That's exactly what he has.) She also said that the test showed Roscoe would be mostly tan, and have black parts like his nose and pads. When Yorkies age they can \"lighten\" or \"grey,\" which can make darker colors stand out. Roscoe's coat has become darker over the years. \nHughes, who ran the test on her own rescue, said the test could give me insights into how to train my dogs. Her adopted dog was driving her nuts barking out all the windows until the DNA test revealed she was part terrier. She was able to find proper terrier training techniques to help calm her dog down. \nDo the results change how I feel about my dogs? Not a single bit. But at least now when someone asks me what kind of dog I have, I'll be able to answer the question. Roscoe Jenkins (left) and Amy Ruth"}

Apple Inc , Microsoft Corp and other software makers have issued patches to protect against the vulnerabilities.\nIntel may be on the hook for costs stemming from lawsuits claiming that the patches would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, and big customers will likely seek compensation from Intel for any software or hardware fixes they make, security experts told Reuters.\n\"The potential liability is big for Intel,\" said Eric Johnson, dean of Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management. \"Everybody will be scrambling over the next few days to figure out just how big it is.\"\nInvestors need more details about the flaws so they can assess their impact on Intel and other technology companies, said Tim Ghriskey, an investment manager with Inverness Counsel in New York.\n\"It remains to be seen whether Intel has higher exposure than its rivals,\" said Ghriskey, whose firm manages $2.8 billion. \"We dont really have a lot of facts yet. A lot of what is out there about the impact on Intel is supposition.\"\nGovernment agencies and security experts said they knew of no cyber attacks that had exploited the vulnerabilities, but some warned that hackers would likely work to target systems while they remained unpatched.\nThe German government's Federal Office for Information Security urged computer users to install patches as soon as they become available and asked technology companies to secure their applications as quickly as possible.\nLawyers filed a lawsuit in San Jose, California, federal court on Wednesday that sought class action status for people who had bought vulnerable Intel chips or computers that came with them already installed.\nThe lawsuit said the patches could \"dramatically\" degrade system performance, giving customers the \"unappealing choice\" of deciding whether to replace the processor, buy a new computer with one that is not vulnerable, install updates that degrade performance or do nothing and risk getting hacked.\nWhile more lawsuits are expected, Intel's biggest customers are likely to quietly seek compensation for any harm caused by the vulnerabilities, including costs to patch machines or replace microprocessors, Johnson said.\nIntel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday about the lawsuit alleging degraded performance.\nLegal experts said that consumers would have to prove concrete damages and harm to proceed with claims.\nClass action lawsuits over cybersecurity issues at companies including Anthem Inc, Target Corp and Yahoo have yielded mixed results and U.S. federal appeals courts are divided over what evidence is needed to bring such claims.\nStewart Baker, a Washington-based lawyer focusing on technology law, said updates that decrease a chip's performance might warrant monetary damages.\nBut a lot of these cases are settled for three cents on the dollar, Baker said, adding that consumers would likely see very little compensation.\nIntel shares fell 1.8 percent on Thursday, following a 3.4 percent decline Wednesday.\nShares in rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc climbed 4.9 percent as investors speculated the No. 2 maker of microprocessors would woo customers away from Intel.\nStill, researchers had said some of AMD's chips had one of the two vulnerabilities disclosed on Wednesday, as do processors from ARM Holdings.

Pakistan has played a double game for years,\u201c Haley told reporters. \u201dThey work with us at times, and they also harbor the terrorists that attack our troops in Afghanistan. \n\u201cThat game is not acceptable to this administration. We expect far more cooperation from Pakistan in the fight against terrorism.\u201d \nThe comments followed an angry tweet from President Donald Trump on Monday that the United States had been rewarded with \u201cnothing but lies and deceit\u201d for \u201cfoolishly\u201d giving Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid in the last 15 years. \n\u201cThey give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!\u201d he tweeted. \nPakistan civilian and military chiefs on Tuesday rejected \u201cincomprehensible\u201d U.S. comments and summoned American Ambassador David Hale to explain Trump\u2019s tweet. \nRelations with Washington have been strained for years over Islamabad\u2019s alleged support for Haqqani network militants, who are allied with the Afghan Taliban. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump talks to reporters before departing the White House for a visit to the Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, DC, U.S., December 21, 2017. REUTERS\/Jim Bourg\/File Photo \nThe United States also alleges that senior Afghan Taliban commanders live on Pakistani soil, and has signaled it will cut aid and take other steps if Islamabad does not stop helping or turning a blind eye to Haqqani militants crossing the border to carry out attacks in Afghanistan. \nIn 2016, Taliban leader Mullah Mansour was killed by a U.S. drone strike inside Pakistan and in 2011, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by U.S. troops in the garrison town of Abbottabad. STATE DEPT: PAKISTAN NEEDS TO EARN ITS AID \nAt the State Department on Tuesday, spokesman Heather Nauert said Pakistan knows what it needs to do, including taking action against the Haqqani network and other militants. \nPakistan needs to \u201cearn, essentially, the money that we have provided in the past in foreign military assistance,\u201d she said. \nIslamabad bristles at the suggestion it is not doing enough to fight militants, noting that its casualties at the hands of Islamists since 2001 number in the tens of thousands. \nPakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Tuesday chaired a National Security Committee meeting of civilian and military chiefs, focusing on Trump\u2019s tweet. The meeting, which lasted nearly three hours, was brought forward by a day and followed an earlier meeting of army generals. \nThe committee, in a statement issued by the prime minister\u2019s office, did not name Trump but spoke of \u201cdeep disappointment\u201d at a slew of critical comments coming from U.S. officials over the past few months. \n\u201cRecent statements and articulation by the American leadership were completely incomprehensible as they contradicted facts manifestly, struck with great insensitivity at the trust between two nations built over generations, and negated the decades of sacrifices made by the Pakistani nation,\u201d it said.

In December, bitcoin itself had briefly surged about 1,900 percent for the year. \n\nRiot Blockchain was once primarily a biotech company named \"Bioptix.\" In early October, the company announced it was changing its name to focus on blockchain-related investments, and shares soared. The company also changed its ticker symbol to RIOT from BIOP.\nThe stock climbed 648 percent from $5.16 at the end of September to a closing high of $38.60 on Dec. 19. As a result, the company's market value jumped from around $17 million this past summer to near $270 million in December 2017, according to FactSet.\nShares were trading about 2 percent lower near $27.80 on Tuesday. \nRiot lists three blockchain investments so far on its website: a Canadian digital currency exchange called Coinsquare, a cryptocurrency accounting firm called Verady, and Tesspay, which is planning to apply blockchain technology to telecom payments.\nIn the first nine months of 2017, Riot reported a net loss of $10.97 million.\nThe SEC declined to comment to CNBC. O'Rourke did not immediately respond to a CNBC email for comment. Riot did not immediately respond to an email and phone call for comment.\nO'Rourke's rapid ascent to the top of Riot Blockchain CEO O'Rourke rose to the head of Riot Blockchain in less than a year, public documents show. \nHe is a managing member of ATG Capital, which focuses on small and mid-cap growth companies. \nO'Rourke was appointed a director of Riot on Jan. 6, 2017. A few weeks after Riot's name change, an Oct. 23 release mentioned O'Rourke's \"recent appointment as President of the Company.\" \nRiot's board then appointed O'Rourke chairman and CEO on Nov. 3. Outgoing chairman and CEO Michael Beeghley's \"resignation was not the result of any disagreement with the Company,\" a filing said.\nThe board approved a monthly salary for O'Rourke of $25,000 \u2014 $300,000 a year \u2014 a restricted stock award of 344,000 shares of common stock that will vest in 24 monthly installments and the option to purchase up to 100,000 shares at $10. \nCitron Research, led by short seller Andrew Left, tweeted on Dec. 18 it was starting a short position, or a bet against, Riot shares. \nLeft said on CNBC's \" Fast Money \" a day later that Riot is \"misrepresenting\" the scale of its blockchain-related investments. Riot had turned down a CNBC request to appear on the show that day. \"No one at the company has been able to get in touch with the CEO,\" a Riot spokesperson said at the time. \nCitron Research tweeted on Dec. 22 that it was covering its short positions in Riot, and the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), because \"easy money has been made.\" Riot shares fell nearly 33 percent between Dec. 18 and Dec. 22. \nOn Dec. 27, two days before O'Rourke sold his shares, Riot postponed its shareholders meeting from Dec. 28 to Feb. 1 due to insufficient participation."}
{"published":"2018-01-21T08:00:00.000+02:00","title":"Eric Trump says the shutdown is 'a good thing for us,\u2019 politically","text":"Eric Trump , President Donald Trump 's second eldest son, had a busy night on Saturday. In addition to filling in for his father at a high-dollar fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago , the president's private club in Palm Beach, Fla., the 34-year old also went on Fox News Channel's \"Judge Jeanine,\" to defend the president's accomplishments.\nBetween accolades for his father, the younger Trump stumbled over a basic rule of politics: Never boast about how you will benefit politically from the misfortune of your constituents.\n\"I think it's a good thing for us,\" Eric Trump said of the government shutdown that was triggered at midnight on Friday by the failure of congressional negotiators and the Trump White House to reach a deal to fund the government. The public, Eric Trump said, would blame Democrats for the paralysis in Washington, and for the forced furlough of hundreds of thousands of federal employees, who would be sent home without pay. \nYet even if this prediction came true \u2013 and recent polling suggests otherwise \u2013 it could be seen as a stumble at a politically fraught time for his father and Republican lawmakers.\nTo be sure, Eric Trump is not the sort of experienced politician who might be expected to navigate situations like these with traditional savvy. But neither is he the disinterested outsider that he promised to be in late 2016, as his father prepared to take office.\nIn March 2017, weeks after the elder Trump's inauguration, Eric Trump was still describing a \"clear separation of church and state\" between his father's political career and the Trump Organization, the family real estate business that he and his brother Donald Trump Jr. are managing while their father is president. Yet almost from the start, both Eric and Donald Jr. have served as outspoken political advocates for the president and his policies.\nSaturday offered a perfect example of this ongoing tension. By calling in to Jeanine Pirro's show a little after 9 p.m. ET, Eric Trump was serving as a both a de facto White House surrogate on prime-time TV and as a stand-in for his father at a gala fundraiser for Trump's reelection campaign. \nWhether Eric Trump's boast will turn into a headache for the Trump White House remains to be seen. And it wasn't the only miscalculation he made on Saturday night.\nDuring Saturday's call-in with Pirro, Eric Trump sought to explain why Democrats deserve the blame for the current shutdown by highlighting how many Democrats voted against a bill to fund the government. \n\"If you looked at the vote, you had 269 Republicans who voted to keep the government open. And you had 230 Democrats who voted to close government,\" he said, \"and they'll say Trump wanted to close the government. ... It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. And I'm pretty good at math.\"\nYet in the House, 230 Republicans voted for the measure, while in the Senate, 45 did, for a total of 275 GOP votes \u2013 not 269, as Trump claimed. On the Democrats' side, 197 voted against the spending bill in the House, while 44 Democrats opposed advancing the measure in the Senate for a total of 241 \u2013 not 230.\nThe White House referred CNBC's questions to Eric Trump, but attempts to reach him late Saturday were unsuccessful."}

The IPO is central to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's effort to create the world's largest sovereign wealth fund and diversify Saudi Arabia's economy.\nSaudi officials have said Aramco could attract a $2 trillion valuation, though others forecast the offering will value the company at $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion. The kingdom aims to raise about $100 billion to underwrite Crown Prince Mohammed's \"Vision 2030\" economic transformation plan.\nIt also stands to enrich banks that secure a role in a complicated offering for a sprawling enterprise deeply intertwined with Saudi Arabia's state finances.\nThe slow pace of progress toward an Aramco IPO has fueled speculation that the sale could be delayed beyond 2018. But on Monday, Bloomberg News reported that Aramco is likely to name Goldman and Citi as lead managers for the offering.\nAlso on Monday, Reuters reported that the Saudis have invited Goldman and Citi , along with Deutsche Bank , to the kingdom to pitch for a role in the share sale in the coming weeks.\nThree other banks that have advised Aramco on the pending share sale \u2014 J.P. Morgan Chase , HSBC and Morgan Stanley \u2014 are also expected to be global coordinators , according to news reports going back to last year.\nAramco and the banks declined to comment on the Bloomberg and Reuters reports.\nIn another recent sign that momentum toward an Aramco IPO is picking up steam, the Saudi government on Friday announced it had changed Aramco's status to a joint-stock company , a move that lets the company issue shares.\nshow chapters Saudi Aramco's massive IPO is 'on track' for next year, CEO says 7:46 AM ET Mon, 23 Oct 2017 | 03:33 Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC in October that the Aramco offering remained on track for 2018 , despite reports that the kingdom was considering shelving the IPO in favor of a private share sale to the Chinese government and others.\nSaudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter. It has spearheaded an effort among its fellow OPEC members, Russia and several other oil-producing nations to kill a global glut of crude that has weighed on prices.\nAn agreement among the nations to cap production has helped boost oil prices above $60 a barrel, a condition industry watchers widely see as necessary for a successful Aramco IPO. The production limits began in January 2017, and the deal is scheduled to remain in place through the end of this year."}

Analysts\u2019 on average were estimating revenue of $14.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. \nWhile headlines suggested the Impact deal announced on Sunday could cost up to $7 billion, Celgene said the only certain cost was the upfront payment of $1.1 billion, with all other payments contingent on approval and major sales milestones for fedratinib, a late stage drug for myelofibrosis. \nWith the addition of fedratinib, Celgene said at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco that it will have 10 late-stage medicines with $1 billion to multibillion-dollar potential that could add more than $15 billion in peak revenue through 2030 as it girds for the eventual loss of patent exclusivity on its flagship blood cancer drug Revlimid. \nMeanwhile, Revlimid continues to grow.

It came amid a U.S. Justice Department investigation into drugmakers\u2019 financial support of patient assistance charities.\nDrugmakers are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in Medicare, the government healthcare program for the elderly. But they may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as the charities are independent.\nAmid increased attention to rising drug prices, concern has arisen that drugmakers\u2019 donations to such charities may be contributing to price inflation.\nIn its lawsuit, PSI, based in Midlothian, Virginia, said it had long operated under an advisory opinion issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General that essentially gave it approval to help Medicare patients.\nBut PSI said the Office of Inspector General in 2017 imposed new guidance requiring it to refrain from engaging in conversations with drugmakers that are donors to obtain information about issues like patient populations and drug costs used to create programs.\n\u201cThe OIG\u2019s restrictions on PSI\u2019s communications with donors are unreasonable, unfair and unconstitutional,\u201d PSI\u2019s general counsel, Neil Millhiser, said in a statement.\nThe agency declined to comment.\nThe Justice Department has been investigating drugmakers\u2019 financial support of charities like PSI. The investigation led United Therapeutics Corp in December to pay $210 million to claims related to its support of one charity.\nThat charity, Caring Voice Coalition, last week said it will not provide financial aid in 2018 after the inspector general revoked its advisory opinion.\nIn September, the Justice Department alleged that a PSI donor, Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Inc, violated an anti-kickback law by using the non-profit to defray co-payments for patients prescribed an expensive cholesterol drug, Juxtapid.\nThe government alleged PSI promoted its ability to create a \u201creimbursement vehicle\u201d for Aegerion, which was able to eliminate price sensitivity for Juxtapid via a fund PSI created that Aegerion, a unit of Novelion Therapeutics Inc, supported.\nAegerion agreed to pay $40.1 million to resolve U.S. probes into its promotion of Juxtapid.\nPSI raised $128 million in 2015 and says it helps hundreds of thousands of patients. But PSI has said it expects to help 2,000 fewer people in 2018 due to a 17 percent drop in its operating budget caused by reduced donations.

The leu had already reached a 2-month high against the euro in the previous session. Trading at 4.636 at 0826 GMT, it was off that high, but still slightly firmer from Friday. A hike in the 1.75 percent benchmark interest rate would make the NBR the second central bank in the European Union's eastern nations to start to lift rates from record low levels, after two hikes by the Czech central bank (CNB) since August. While the CNB has the lowest inflation target in the region at 2 percent, markets have been gripped by overheating concerns in Romania where a surge in wages has helped the economy to grow by a stellar annual 8.8 percent in the third quarter of last year. Between August and November, Romania's annual inflation rate surged two percentage points to 3.2 percent. In a Reuters poll, five analysts expected the bank to hold fire, while four projected a quarter point hike. \"There are concerns that inflation may rise above 5 percent by the summer and everybody is looking at the central bank, what they will do,\" one fixed income trader said. \"This caused the recent swings in bond yields there... and worries could boost yields if the central bank does not deliver a hike,\" the trader added. Romanian 2027-expiry bonds traded at a yield of 4.3 percent, flat from Friday. Elsewhere in the region, the zloty eased 0.2 percent to 4.159, but remained near Friday's six-and-a-half year highs of 4.143. The region's currencies generally started the year strengthening, lifted by a rise in risk appetite in global markets and the prospect of healthy economic growth in Central Europe. The Polish central bank is unlikely to encourage expectations for interest rate hikes at its meeting on Wednesday. \"The zloty will probably not be helped by comments after the MPC (central bank) meeting,\" ING analysts said in a note, adding that correction could weaken the zloty to 4.2 in the next couple of weeks, even though a big easing is unlikely. The forint also eased slightly. New Hungarian data showed that industrial output grew 3.4 percent in annual terms in November, half of analysts' forecast, but retail sales grew at a robust 6.4 percent rate. Czech output growth, at 8.5 percent, exceeded expectations, similar to a 11.7 billion crown trade surplus in November. The crown firmed 0.1 percent.

He reportedly singled out Haiti further in his remarks, asking \u201cWhy do we need more Haitians? Take them out.\u201d \nTrump\u2019s slur was widely condemned by Democratic lawmakers, along with some Republican lawmakers. Many called the remarks racist including a United Nations human rights official. \nOn Friday, Trump denied the comments, tweeting that his language was \u201ctough\u201d but that he did not use the words attributed to him in news reports. \u201cI never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country,\u201d Trump added. \nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Haiti, which is indeed impoverished, rocked by natural disasters, and a frequently beset by political upheaval. But it also has a rich culture and has played an important role in American history. Haiti\u2019s history \nChristopher Columbus landed on the island (now called Hispaniola) in 1492, and during colonization, most of the native population was wiped out. In 1697, the western third of the island was given to the French , who prospered from the export of sugar, coffee, cacao and more. Most of the agricultural work was done by slaves brought from Western Africa, who made up the majority of the population. \nThe Haitian Revolution, a series uprisings occurring between 1791 and 1804 by both freed men and slaves, ended French colonial rule. However the legacy of poverty from slavery shapes the island even to this day. \nIn 1825 Haiti was forced to pay France an \u201cindependence debt\u201d of 150 million gold francs, under the threat of invasion, which The Guardian notes was \u201cten times the fledgling black nation\u2019s total annual revenues.\u201d Haiti helped with the American Revolution \nNearly 500 free black men from Haiti recruited by a French admiral participated in the 1779 Siege of Savannah, fighting with colonists against British. They were known as the Chasseurs Volontaires, and they were recruited with the hope that by serving in the military they\u2019d be recognized as citizens of the French empire, according to Ozy . The siege failed and the Chasseurs were ultimately exiled. Haiti\u2019s troubled economy \nHaiti\u2019s economy has lagged due to the legacy of slavery, poverty, natural disasters, corruption, U.S. occupation, and political turmoil. In 2016 Haiti\u2019s GPD per capita was $1,800. It is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, according to the CIA\u2019s World Factbook , with 60% of the population living below the poverty line. Haitian immigration to the U.S. \nThere were 676,000 Haitian immigrants living in the U.S. in 2015\u2014up from 587,000 in 2010. Around 58,000 Haitians remained in the U.S. after the 2010 earthquake through temporary protected status (TPS), a policy rescinded by the Trump administration in 2017 that required them to leave the U.S. by July 2019. \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security established the Haitian Family Reunification Parole (HFRP) in 2014. The program \u201cwill allow certain eligible Haitians with already approved family-based immigrant visa petitions an opportunity to enter the United States up to two years in advance of their visa eligibility dates,\u201d according to the State Department . Through this, approximately 5,000 Haitians are eligible to legally immigrate to the U.S. annually. Haiti\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s remarks \nHaiti denounced Trump\u2019s remarks in a statement from President Jovenel Moise\u2019s administration. \u201cThe Haitian government condemns in the strongest terms these abhorrent and obnoxious remarks which, if proven, reflect a totally erroneous and racist view of the Haitian community and its contribution to the United States,\u201d the statement read. Haiti\u2019s 2010 earthquake \nTrump\u2019s comments came just a day before the Jan. 12 anniversary of the calamitous 7.0 earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010, killing hundreds of thousands of people.

Spot gold was down 0.5 percent at $1,314.51 an ounce at 1100 GMT. Last week, prices touched their strongest since Sept. 15 at $1,325.86. U.S. gold futures fell 0.4 percent to $1,315.50 an ounce. The dollar hit a more than one-week high against a basket of other major currencies on Monday . It was up 0.2 percent on Tuesday, making commodities priced in the greenback more expensive for buyers using other currencies. \"The dollar has bounced back, partly due to weakness in the euro,\" said Jonathan Butler, commodities analyst at Mitsubishi in London. The euro is down due to concerns about upcoming Italian elections, problems forming a government in Germany and lingering concerns about Brexit, he added. \"There's also the continuing rally in the equity markets. All of that has probably helped take the wind out of gold's sails,\" Butler said.

{"published":"2018-01-12T16:19:00.000+02:00","title":"Rents boost U.S. core CPI; retail sales rise solidly","text":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Underlying U.S. consumer prices recorded their largest increase in 11 months in December on strong gains in the cost of rental accommodation and healthcare, bolstering expectations that inflation will accelerate this year. \nThe strengthening domestic demand was also underscored by other data on Friday showing retail sales rising at a solid clip in December. The reports probably will keep the Federal Reserve on course to increase interest rates in March. \nThey raised the prospects of a more aggressive monetary policy tightening this year, especially against the backdrop of a $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month. \nThe U.S. central bank is forecasting three rate increases this year. It raised borrowing costs three times in 2017. \n\u201cThe economy is doing quite well right now ... and well enough for the Fed to feel compelled to take steps to take the edge off before inflation truly becomes problematic,\u201d said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. \nThe Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.3 percent last month as prices for new and used cars and trucks and motor vehicle insurance increased. \nThat was the biggest advance in the so-called core CPI since January 2017 and followed a 0.1 percent gain in November. The core CPI increased 1.8 percent in the 12 months through December, picking up from 1.7 percent in November. \nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast core CPI rising 0.2 percent month-on-month and holding steady at 1.7 percent on an annual basis. Weak import and producer price data this week had raised concerns about the inflation outlook, although the two reports do not have a strong correlation with the CPI. \nEconomists are hoping that a tightening labor market, rising commodity prices, a weak dollar and fiscal stimulus will lift inflation toward the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target this year. \nThe central bank\u2019s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, has missed its target since May 2012. \nThe dollar briefly trimmed losses against a basket of currencies after the CPI data, but later slumped to a four-month low on expectations that the European Central Bank would wind down its bond buying program this year. \nPrices for U.S. Treasuries fell, with the yield on the interest-rate sensitive two-year note rising to its highest since September 2008. Stocks on Wall street were trading higher. \nBROAD PRICE INCREASES Supporting the rise in underlying inflation pressures last month, rents increased 0.4 percent. Owners\u2019 equivalent rent of primary residence climbed 0.3 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in November. \nThe cost of medical care increased 0.3 percent, with prices for prescription medication surging 1.0 percent after rising 0.6 percent in November. The cost of both hospital and doctor visits increased 0.3 percent. The higher healthcare costs led economists to expect the core PCE price index probably rose 0.2 percent in December after nudging up 0.1 percent in November. \nThe government will release the December core PCE price index data later this month. \nCheaper gasoline prices, however, limited the increase in the overall CPI to 0.1 percent in December after a 0.4 percent rise in November. That lowered the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 2.1 percent from 2.2 percent in November. \nLast month, gasoline prices fell 2.7 percent after rebounding 7.3 percent in November. Food prices rose 0.2 percent after being unchanged for two straight months. \nSeparately, the Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.4 percent last month after advancing 0.9 percent in November. Retail sales increased 5.4 percent from a year earlier. \nSales last month were lifted by a 1.2 percent jump in receipts at gardening and building material stores and a 0.2 percent rise for auto dealerships. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 0.3 percent last month after an upwardly revised 1.4 percent surge in November. \nThese so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously reported to have gained 0.8 percent in November. Last month\u2019s increase in retail sales and the sharp upward revision to November data bolstered economists\u2019 expectations of an acceleration in consumer spending in the fourth quarter. \nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.2 percent annualized rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent pace during that period. \n\u201cThe upward revisions to November and October put consumer spending on a stronger upward trajectory than we thought,\u201d said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. \nAnother report from the Commerce Department showed business inventories increased 0.4 percent in November after being unchanged in October. \nAs a result of Friday\u2019s data, the Atlanta Fed raised its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate by five-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.3 percent rate. \nReporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Lisa Von Ahn\n "}

The G10 economic surprise index \u2013 which nets positive over negative hits and misses on incoming data \u2013 continues to hover close to its most positive readings in almost 8 years. \nThere will be harder data on industrial output for Q4 next week, as well as trade data readings from China and tech soundings in Asia from the likes of Samsung. Inflation-focused central banks that have fueled all this with their record cheap money will be looking at the rising price of oil meanwhile. 2\/ YEARNING FOR EARNINGS \nPerhaps one reason for the latest run up in stocks, the Q4 earnings season, comes back onto the radar, with the big U.S. financials kicking off at the end of the week. \nJPMorgan Chase and rival Wells Fargo launch the earnings season with reports before the opening bell on Friday. Even despite the record low financial market volatility that\u2019s crimping trading revenues, deal making has been super brisk over recent months and overall fee income from banks around the world rose some 16 percent last year to a record level of more than $100 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. \nThe numbers should be good. Blended year-on-year Q4 earnings growth for the S&P 500 overall is expected to be 11.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S estimates, up from 8.5 percent in Q3. Excluding the energy sector, which benefits from weak year-earlier comparisons, it is seen at 9.5 percent. \nData which runs since 1994 shows that in a typical quarter 64 percent of companies beat estimates and 21 percent miss estimates. Over the past four quarters, however, 72 percent have beaten the Street estimates and only 19 percent have missed them. 3\/ SOLVING A PROBLEM LIKE KOREA? \nOfficials from North and South Korea will meet on Tuesday for their first official talks in more than two years. \nAgreeing to the meeting represents a turnaround by Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime, which has focused in the past 12 months on developing its nuclear arsenal amid bellicose exchanges with U.S. President Donald Trump, raising alarm across the world. \nThe meeting is expected to focus on the North potentially sending athletes to the Winter Olympics to be held in the South in February as well as on some other inter-Korean relations, according to Seoul. \nEvery word and gesture will be scrutinized by geopolitical analysts as they try to judge if this really is a re-emerging detente between the two nations, not to mention the reaction from Trump\u2019s twitter account. 4\/BOOM BOOM, AND? \nA blizzard of data is expected to show China\u2019s economy ended a strong 2017 on a slightly softer note. However, activity has remained more resilient than expected despite a crackdown on industrial pollution, overzealous lending and a cooling property market. \nThe week kicks off with forex reserves data and a bunch of inflation numbers, before the focus will switch to trade figures out on Friday. Exports are expected to have jumped more than 9 percent in December after soaring unexpectedly 12.3 percent in November thanks to sustained strength in global demand. \nA slight pullback in December industrial growth, producer inflation and investment would all reinforce consensus views that the world\u2019s second-largest economy will slow only marginally in 2018. A more marked loss of momentum may put fears of a sharper slowdown back on the table, unsettle the yuan and possibly stall the government\u2019s push to reduce rising debt. 5\/HELLAS ANGEL \nIt may be the depths of winter with storms tearing across the euro zone, but the political and economic skies are almost cloudless all of a sudden. \nOn Sunday, Angela Merkel will begin trying to re-form a \u2018grand coalition\u2019, an effort that could rumble on for a few months, and campaigning for Italy\u2019s uncertain election in March is also getting underway, but the rest of the bloc looks buoyant. \nPerhaps the most eye-catching thing is that crisis posterchild Greece\u2019s borrowing costs hit their lowest in 12 years on Friday on expectations that the country could conclude its euro zone\/IMF bailout package later this year. \nThat would cap a slowly strengthening recovery eight years after Greece lurched on the brink of defaulting on its debt and risked being kicked out of the single currency bloc. \nGraphic: The new year party for world markets - reut.rs\/2Cwwb25 \nGraphic: U.S. earnings estimates - reut.rs\/2Cw0XIj \nGraphic: North & South Korea - Lines of communication IMG: tmsnrt.rs\/2CtuIJS \nGraphic: China Economic Snapshot - Trade: reut.rs\/2CWFqcZ \nGraphic: Searing returns on Greek and Portuguese debt - reut.rs\/2zKUDL6 Additional reporting by Karin Strohecker in London, Dan Burns in New York and Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore"}

The estimated income tax expense and related liability associated with the repatriation is approximately $20 million compared to an estimated $60 million in income tax expense that the Company would have incurred if it had repatriated the accumulated foreign income before the effectiveness of the Act.

Twitter has deleted anti-Muslim and anti-migrant posts by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and blocked a satirical account that parodied Islamophobia. \n\u201cPlease spare us the thought police!\u201d read a headline in Wednesday\u2019s Bild above an article that called the law a \u201csin\u201d against freedom of opinion enshrined in Germany\u2019s constitution. \nThe law requires social media sites to delete or block obviously criminal content within 24 hours but Bild Editor-in-Chief Julian Reichelt said it could be applied against anything and anyone since there was no definition of what was \u201cmanifestly unlawful\u201d in most cases. \nIntended to prevent radical groups from gaining influence, it was having precisely the opposite effect, he said. \n\u201cThe law against online hate speech failed on its very first day. It should be abolished immediately,\u201d Reichelt wrote, adding that the law was turning AfD politicians into \u201copinion martyrs\u201d. \nAmong the tweets deleted was one by AfD lawmaker Beatrix von Storch criticizing police for tweeting in Arabic, saying they had sought \u201cto appease the barbaric, Muslim, rapist hordes of men\u201d. Police have since asked prosecutors to investigate her for possible incitement to hatred. \nA deleted tweet by another AfD member of parliament, Jens Maier, called Noah Becker - the son of former tennis champion Boris Becker - a \u201chalf-nigger\u201d. \nJustice Minister Heiko Maas defended the law, telling Bild that freedom of opinion did not mean carte blanche to spread criminal content on the internet. \n\u201cCalls to murder, threats, insults and incitement of the masses or Auschwitz lies are not an expression of freedom of opinion but rather attacks on the freedom of opinion of others,\u201d he said. \nGermany has some of the world\u2019s toughest laws on defamation, incitement to commit crimes and threats of violence, with prison sentences for Holocaust denial or inciting hatred against minorities. \nMaas said social networks needed to stick to the law like everyone else, adding: \u201cThose who care about protecting freedom of opinion can\u2019t just look on as criminal incitement and threats inhibit the open exchange of views.\u201d Reporting by Michelle Martin; Editing by Robin Pomeroy"}

A patient is pushed down a corridor in Frimley Park Hospital near Camberley, Britain, January 4, 2018.

Slideshow (4 Images) \nThe pressure continues to grow, according to new data on Thursday. \nThe number of patients stuck in ambulances for at least an hour almost doubled to more 4,700 cases during the Christmas week compared with the week before. \nDepartment of Health guidelines say ambulance crews should be able to hand patients over to hospital staff within 15 minutes of arrival at hospital. \nThe average bed occupancy for the Christmas week was 91.7 percent. Doctors say that anything above 85 percent is unsafe. \nThe conditions have led some doctors taking to Twitter to vent their frustrations. \nOne London-based doctor wrote that conditions were so bad that he was practicing \u201cbattlefield medicine\u201d, while another apologized for the \u201c3rd world conditions\u201d caused by overcrowding.

It found that the \"overall global gender gap can be closed in exactly 100 years\" and that the most challenging gender gaps were in the economic and health spheres.\nWEF noted that the gender pay pap was deteriorating and that \"given the continued widening of the economic gender gap, it will now not be closed for another 217 years.\" According to PwC's Women in Work Index 2017, achieving pay parity in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) could increase total female earnings by $2 trillion .\nMinouche Shafik, director of the London School of Economics and a WEF contributor, told CNBC that society needed more women at senior levels of corporate life.\n\"There are still many places where women are paid differently for equal work at the same level (as men) and every decent organization should look at itself and make sure everyone's being paid equally. That's a minimum that everyone should be able to do immediately. Then the longer-term issue is about getting more women to a senior level.\"\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook ."}

Making a wise decision requires pausing for a moment. The key is to distinguish between challenges you should try to overcome and fundamental problems that are true deal breakers.\nMore new hires are heading for the exits fast, employers and career coaches say. Two-thirds of employees have taken a job only to realize later that it was a bad fit, and half of those employees quit within six months , says a recent CareerBuilder survey of 3,697 U.S. employees. Many young workers have two or three jobs listed on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s by age 30 and leave out those that lasted fewer than a few weeks.\nLori Cheek quit after a few days on a furniture-sales job several years ago. She was exhausted by dragging a suitcase loaded with heavy product manuals around New York City all day on the subway to meet with customers, then continuing to work at the office until 8 p.m. She snapped up what looked like a better sales job at a showroom nearby, selling stylish designer furnishings.\n\u201cIt was the worst decision ever,\u201d Ms. Cheek says. Her supervisor on the first job, who had spent time training her, was deeply disappointed, and one manager on her new job pained her even more. \u201cAt first sight he could not stand the way I dressed. He wanted an Ann Taylor look, and I\u2019m more Gwen Stefani, edgy,\u201d Ms. Cheek says. She grudgingly toned down her jewelry, makeup and hair. To avoid earning a reputation as a job-hopper, however, she stuck with the new position for almost a year. Looking back, Ms. Cheek, owner of a free mobile dating app called Cheekd, wishes she\u2019d stayed on the first job and tried to negotiate better terms and conditions.\nQuiz: Is Your Job an Instant Disaster? Photo: ISTOCK \nStarting a new job can be overwhelming. People under stress in situations that are uncertain or ambiguous tend to make decisions that are risky or unwise, according to a 2016 study by German researchers. \nQuitting abruptly risks earning bad references from former bosses and their contacts. It also may mean living without a paycheck for a while. \nRob Hill was dismayed two years ago to learn that he was expected as a manager of a new manufacturing plant to work the 5 a.m.-to-5 p.m. shift, plus several more hours\u2014a fact he says hadn\u2019t been clear to him during interviews. He quit after two days. After working long hours on similar jobs in the past, \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to hurt like that anymore,\u201d Mr. Hill says. He had to live on his savings for a month, but he landed a more fulfilling position, as director of operations for a Denver community foundation.\nBefore resigning abruptly, new hires should ask themselves if they\u2019re giving the job a fair chance. New employees\u2019 behavior helps determine the amount of support they receive, according to a 2017 study of 273 new hires and 203 managers. Those who seem committed to the job and ask questions get more help from managers, says Allison Marie Ellis, the study\u2019s lead author and an assistant professor of management and human resources at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo.\nHaving a new hire quit is costly for employers. It forces them to restart the hiring process and damages morale. Several people Julie Jansen hired and trained as recruiters on a previous job years ago quit after only one day. \u201cIt was devastating. You think you know if someone is a fit, and then they just disappear,\u201d says Ms. Jansen, author of \u201cI Don\u2019t Know What I Want, But I Know It\u2019s Not This,\u201d a best-selling career book.\nIt isn\u2019t wise to exit just because you don\u2019t like the person next to you or have to do grunt work all day. If the boss is abrasive, push back a bit. One intern at a Wall Street financial-services firm whose boss seemed unduly brusque asked him, \u201cAre you just having a bad day, or are you always like this?\u201d says Rebecca Zucker, a career and executive coach at Next Step Partners in San Francisco. The intern not only survived the exchange but earned better treatment from the boss, Ms. Zucker says.\nQuitting early may be warranted if an employer tries a bait-and-switch\u2014promising one job and assigning you to a different one, or violating other agreed-upon terms, says Chicago career coach Jody Michael. \u201cIf you\u2019re told you\u2019ll be reporting to the CEO, but in actuality there\u2019s someone positioned between you and the CEO, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Ms. Michael says.\nOne manager learned on his first day at an automotive company that his base pay would be cut in half under a new company compensation plan, says Carlos Kingwergs, Latin America regional director for AutoKineto, an international executive-search firm based in Columbia, S.C. The employer increased his bonus to make up for it, Mr. Kingwergs says, but the new hire quit, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I signed on for.\u201d\nOther job seekers take a position because it\u2019s their only offer, then exit after receiving an offer for their dream job that requires them to start right away, Ms. Michael says. That\u2019s not an ideal path, but some opportunities are simply too good to refuse.\nWhatever the reason, it\u2019s important to leave on as positive a note as possible, says Jill Tipograph, co-founder of Early Stage Careers, a New York City coaching service for recent college grads. Most employers won\u2019t want to keep a new hire around if he or she gives two weeks\u2019 notice right away. But ask if you can help with the transition in other ways, such as leaving notes on any work you\u2019ve done. \u201cFirst and last impressions are what people remember,\u201d she says.\nMore From Work & Family \nWhen Your Child Won\u2019t Hug the Relatives December 26, 2017 Sexual-Harassment Training Gets a Revamp December 19, 2017 The Tough Job of Playing Well With Colleagues November 28, 2017 Step Away From Your Over-Scheduled High School Student November 21, 2017 When Your Company Makes You Queasy November 14, 2017 Write to Sue Shellenbarger at sue.shellenbarger@wsj.com"}

Residents have been furious at the authorities for what they see as a failure to investigate such cases. \nThe spokesman for Pakistan\u2019s Punjab province, Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan, told Reuters that protesters turned violent and attacked a local police office. \n\u201cThey started throwing stones at the office and some of armed protesters shot bullets at police. In order to stop them, police resorted to aerial firing,\u201d Khan said, adding that two people were killed and one wounded as a result. \nLocals said police responded with undue force. \n\u201cA peaceful protest was taking place, some students threw stones and police responded by firing at the crowd,\u201d Saleem ur Rehman, a resident who was at the protest, told Reuters. \u201cThe law and order situation here is really bad and there have been many such incidents. That is what the protest was about.\u201d \nAnsari\u2019s parents, who were not in the country when their daughter was kidnapped, returned on Wednesday. \n\u201cI want justice! I want justice!\u201d Zainab\u2019s mother cried, surrounded by reporters at the international airport in the capital Islamabad. \nAnsari\u2019s case has attracted the attention of the country\u2019s civilian and military leadership, with Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif calling for immediate action. \nPolice in Kasur deny they have been lax in investigating child abductions in the town. Regional police officer Zulfiqar Hameed told Reuters that four kidnappers had been arrested and another killed during an arrest attempt. \n\u201cInvestigations reveal that in each case a pedophile kidnaps little girls, rapes them and kills them,\u201d he said. \nThe case of Ansari would soon be solved, he said: \u201cWe have got CCTV footage that shows a young man taking her along. We will catch him very soon,\u201d he said, adding that 95 DNA samples had been taken from suspects. \nA number of police officials have been transferred out of the region for failing to investigate complaints of missing children since 2015, when authorities uncovered what they called a pedophile ring linked to a prominent local family.

Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: helen.reid.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net Closing snapshot: European shares end slightly lower Though strength in commodities-related sectors did help stem losses. That's it for today folks, see you tomorrow for more on European equity markets, with all eyes on MiFID. We'll leave you with a closing snapshot: (Kit Rees) ** Miners pull European stocks off lows heading into close (1602 GMT) This is thanks to a turnaround among basic resources stocks, which are now in positive territory with steel makers such as ArcelorMittal, Tenaris and Voestalpine among the biggest mining gainers. Likewise energy stocks are positive while banks are flat, so we're seeing a helping hand from the cyclical cohort. (Kit Rees) Portuguese shares post mysterious outperformance (1554 GMT) Portugal's blue-chip index is set for a stellar outperformance in comparison to its European peers, rising 1.4 percent while the STOXX 600 is losing 0.2 percent. But we don't know why. \"I really can't see a single explanation to explain this\", a Parisian asset manager told us, saying current tailwinds for energy and financial stocks could be among the positive factors lifting the PSI 20. Another possible explanation would be a very large investor going overweight on the country. A trader in Lisbon also said he couldn't see any specific piece of news to justify today's move. You can see Portugal's outperformance here: tmsnrt.rs\/2CCu1yI (Julien Ponthus) ** Bond market jitters a worry for stocks? (1505 GMT) Bond yields across the euro zone have shot up today after hawkish comments from a central banker spread fear among investors that the end of the ECB's stimulus programme could come earlier than expected. Part of today's stock market weakness could be down to a contagion effect from the bond sell-off as yields on German Bunds, the regional benchmark, hit a two-month high. \"The irrational exuberance supporting bond markets is over and equity markets will likely experience a long overdue correction in the path to a higher interest rate environment,\" says Christopher Peel, CIO at Tavistock Wealth. \"This is the start of a longer-term portfolio rotation that reduces bond duration and increases equity exposure, especially Smart Beta strategies.\" Investors are likely to stay favourable to stocks as long as their yield remains relatively more attractive, and Peel reckons bond yields will have to rise by at least 100 basis points for that relative advantage to disappear. He sees it as more of an issue for stocks in 2019. Here's a graphic courtesy of our colleague Dhara Ranasinghe showing the pressure on Europe's periphery bond markets - and the full bond report here: (Helen Reid) ** Bond funds were November's winners in Europe -Lipper (1404 GMT) Bond funds were a clear favourite among long-term mutual funds in Europe in November, according to research by Thomson Reuters Lipper, and saw 18 billion euros' worth of inflows. Equity funds came in second place, with more than 7 billion euros' worth of inflows. Overall net inflows into European mutual funds stood at nearly 29 billion euros for November. (Kit Rees) ** U.S. stock futures up - but does the first day of trading matter? (1300 GMT) Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones are all trading higher ahead of the Wall Street open, pointing to a strong start to 2018 for U.S. stocks, which had a stellar 2017. Some analysts say the direction on the first day of trading is actually a good predictor of how well stocks will do in the 12 subsequent months. Here's some number-crunching courtesy of Ryan Detrick, senior market analyst at LPL Financial: We checked whether we could find a similar trend for the STOXX 600 and the answer is no, not really. Since 2008, three years yielded negative returns (2008, 2011 and 2016). The year started badly in 2008 and 2016 but not in 2011. Of the 7 years when shares finished higher, two had a negative start (2014 and 2015). It's probably safe not to read much into day one. (Helen Reid and Julien Ponthus) ** Something \"naysayers\" forget about the U.S. yield curve (1220 GMT) Investors who worry that the flattening of the U.S. yield curve signals the upcoming end of the bull market forget one thing, SocGen's Alvin Tan writes. \"Naysayers might point to the flattening U.S. yield curve, but in the past two episodes (1998 and 2005) when the yield curve flattened to zero, the S&P500 index continued to climb for well over a year\", he notes. (Julien Ponthus) ** MiFID II- \"Peppercorn prices are unacceptable,\" research platform says (1157 GMT) \"MiFID II has arrived and action must be taken,\" writes Russell Napier, co-founder of research marketplace ERIC. He worries that a number of investments banks are conducting a \"research price war\" in a bid to woo clients. \"Devaluing (research) could harm the end investor, in direct contrast with MiFID II's ultimate aim\", he adds. Have a look at Reuters' latest stories on MiFID II, which comes into force tomorrow: (Julien Ponthus) ** More pressure in store for European retailers - Deutsche Bank (1141 GMT) There's a big focus on retail in notes this morning, with the big UK retailers Kit just mentioned due to report next week. Weighing in on non-food retailers, Deutsche Bank analysts say macro conditions will continue to be pretty unhelpful and performance will be largely determined by structural changes in a disrupted industry. Here are five investment tips and themes DB suggests to navigate this: 1) Buy the value retailers DB's top picks are AB Foods, B&M and Boohoo which could all benefit from consumers shifting to cheaper stores 2) Watch the value traps in mid-market apparel retail M&S, Next and Debenhams should be avoided despite low valuation multiples, DB reckons, though it sees a \"slightly better\" year for them in 2018 3) Back online brands over the platforms DB prefers ASOS and Boohoo over Showroomprive and Zalando, saying the UK online fashion starlets are more differentiated and can drive stronger growth 4) Be sceptical of transformation stories It's a difficult backdrop for successful turnarounds in the sector and DB downgrades Carpetright for that reason 5) Buy travel companies at the right price Airport retailers such as Dufry and WH Smith could benefit from increasing airport traffic boosting their captive consumer base (Helen Reid) ** X-mas: analysts watching UK \"Big Four\" supermarkets vs. discounters (1131 GMT) Following the Christmas period, it looks like there's a lot of interest in retailers - UBS analysts are weighing in with their thoughts on UK grocers, which have been feeling the heat from the discounters as well as an inflation-pressured consumer. \"With UK disposable income squeezed, Christmas trading could be a bellwether for down-trading in 2018,\" UBS analysts say in a note. \"But th"}

Total net sales within the Wholesale segment increased 52 percent. Retail identical store sales were negative 3.5 percent. Fees earned under services agreements in the third quarter were $33 million compared to $37 million last year.\nGross profit for the third quarter was $409 million and included merger and integration costs of $2 million. When adjusted for this item, gross profit was $411 million, or 10.5 percent of net sales. Last year\u2019s third quarter gross profit was $407 million, or 13.6 percent of net sales. The gross profit rate decrease compared to last year is primarily due to the change in business segment mix, with Wholesale representing a larger portion of total sales and gross profit, and the contribution from Unified Grocers at a lower gross profit rate.\nSelling and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $370 million and included merger and integration costs of $3 million and store closure charges and costs of $3 million. When adjusted for these items, selling and administrative expenses were $364 million, or 9.3 percent of net sales. Selling and administrative expenses in last year\u2019s third quarter were $391 million and included a pension settlement charge of $41 million and store closure charges and costs of $1 million. When adjusted for these items, last year\u2019s selling and administrative expenses were $349 million, or 11.6 percent of net sales. The decrease in the adjusted selling and administrative expense rate compared to last year was primarily driven by the change in business segment mix, with Wholesale representing a larger portion of total sales and selling and administrative expenses, and higher pension income, partially offset by higher employee-related costs.\nNet interest expense for the third quarter was $29 million compared to $40 million in last year\u2019s third quarter. The decrease in interest expense was driven by lower average outstanding debt balances associated with the use of proceeds from the sale of Save-A-Lot.\nIncome tax benefit was $8 million, or negative 77.1 percent of pre-tax earnings, for the third quarter, compared to income tax benefit of $27 million, or 71.6 percent of pre-tax loss, in last year\u2019s third quarter. This quarter's tax benefit was driven by a $12 million non-cash tax benefit from the release of certain tax reserves.\nSupervalu expects the newly enacted federal tax legislation to reduce future cash taxes, although it is still evaluating the favorable impact.\nWholesale\nThird quarter Wholesale net sales were $2.89 billion, compared to $1.91 billion last year, an increase of 52 percent. The net sales increase is primarily due to sales from the acquired Unified Grocers business, sales to new customers and increased sales to new stores operated by existing customers, partially offset by stores no longer operated by customers and lower military sales.\nWholesale operating earnings in the third quarter were $46 million and included $2 million of merger and integration costs. When adjusted for this item, third quarter Wholesale operating earnings were $48 million, or 1.7 percent of net sales. Last year\u2019s third quarter Wholesale operating earnings were $52 million, or 2.7 percent of net sales. The decrease in adjusted Wholesale operating earnings, as a percent of net sales, was driven by the mix impact of the acquired Unified Grocers business contributing to operating earnings at a lower percent of net sales and higher trucking and logistics costs.\nRetail\nThird quarter Retail net sales were $1.02 billion, compared to $1.06 billion last year, a decrease of 4.1 percent. The net sales decrease reflects identical store sales of negative 3.5 percent and closed stores, partially offset by new and acquired store sales.\nRetail operating loss in the third quarter was $6 million and included $3 million in store closure charges and costs. When adjusted for this item, Retail operating loss in the third quarter was $3 million. Last year\u2019s third quarter Retail operating loss was $14 million and included a $15 million goodwill impairment charge and $1 million of store closure charges and costs. When adjusted for these items, last year\u2019s third quarter Retail operating earnings were $2 million, or 0.2 percent of net sales. The decrease in adjusted Retail o"}

French President Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech at the Daming Palace in Xian, Shaanxi province, China, January 8, 2018. REUTERS\/Charles Platiau \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron went out of his way to win the heart of the Chinese leader on the first day of his state visit on Monday, offering him a horse of the elite French Republican Guard. \nMacron is on a three-day tour of China starting with a stop in Xian, an eastern departure point of the ancient Silk Road where he visited the Terracotta Army with his wife Brigitte and will talk of past and future Sino-French relations. \nAn adept of soft diplomacy and symbols, Macron picked an 8-year old brown gelding named Vesuvius from the presidential cavalry corps and braved stringent Chinese quarantine checks to offer it to President Xi Jinping. \nThe choice of the gift, an \u201cunprecedented diplomatic gesture\u201d according to the French presidency, was made after the Chinese president expressed his fascination for the 104 horsemen who escorted him during his last visit to Paris in 2014. \nIt is the first time France has offered one of the elite cavalry corps\u2019 horses and is also a response to China\u2019s \u201cpanda diplomacy\u201d, after Macron\u2019s wife Brigitte became the godmother of a Chinese panda lent by Beijing to a zoo near Paris. \n\u201cIt mattered a lot for the president, even if it was very complicated to import a horse for sanitary reasons. It\u2019s a symbol of French excellence,\u201d an Elysee official said. \nSince his election last May, France\u2019s youngest leader since Napoleon has shown his willingness to use symbols and history to win over his global counterparts. \nMacron flattered Russian President Vladimir Putin in May with a meeting at the sumptuous palace of France\u2019s former monarchy, built in Versailles by Louis XIV - the \u201cSun King\u201d - to symbolise absolute power. \nHe also invited U.S. President Donald Trump to watch a military parade on the grandest avenue of Paris on Bastille Day last July to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry into World War One. \nTrump later said Macron was doing a \u201cterrific job\u201d. \nIn Xian, Macron decided at the last minute to visit the Wild Goose Pagoda, a virtually unknown landmark in the West compared with the terracotta soldiers but well-known by Chinese people as a histor2ic site for Buddhism. \nThe 40-year old French president is keen to gain more access for French companies to often protected Chinese markets and is travelling with a delegation of about 50 businessmen.

I have a feeling of chagrin, to be honest. But the responsibility is all mine,\u201d he said in the Dec. 28 statement. \nThe incident has thrown a spotlight on sumo\u2019s struggle to reform harsh conditions that can breed violence in its closed, hierarchical world, although some wrestlers say there have been improvements in the decade since a trainee was beaten to death.

Such shares grant differentiated voting rights and underpin the alternative governance and shareholding structures favoured by many owners of new age industries such as technology.\nOver $3 billion worth of Alibaba shares were traded on Monday, based on Reuters calculations using NASDAQ data. The stock closed at $190.33, with 16.23 million shares traded.\nThat compares with the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd's (HKEX) average daily securities turnover of HK$88.2 billion ($11.28 billion) in 2017.\n'New economy' platform Shares in HKEX, the city's exchange operator, rose as much as 3.1 percent to HK$270 on Tuesday, their highest level since July 2015.\nAnalysts said that an Alibaba listing in Hong Kong could help drive more funds from the mainland towards the city and could convince other big firms, in particular technology-related ones, to list in the financial hub.\nshow chapters Alibaba founder Jack Ma: China isn\u2019t stealing jobs, it\u2019s creating jobs 8:02 AM ET Tue, 5 Dec 2017 | 01:27 \"If the trading volume in Hong Kong is even better than that in the U.S., it will send out a signal to other new economy new listings that Hong Kong is a much better place for a listing than the U.S,\" said Steven Leung, sales director at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong.\nFor Alibaba, it could provide greater access to investors closer to China who are familiar with its business and allow it to benefit from the Hong Kong government's growing support for financial services innovation, said James Lloyd, Asia-Pacific FinTech leader at consulting firm EY.\nThe HKEX said in December that it had begun drafting specific rule changes for allowing dual-class shares that will be put up for a formal public consultation in the first three months of 2018.\nUnder the planned rule changes, \"innovative\" Chinese companies with a market capitalisation over HK$10 billion and a primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq or the London Stock Exchange would be able to seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong. The HKEX has not yet defined what \"innovative\" is.\n\"We are also creating a new route to secondary listings in Hong Kong to attract companies from emerging and innovative sectors. We are aware that many successful new economy companies already listed in the US and UK would benefit from these reforms,\" wrote Charles Li, chief executive of HKEX, in a blog post last month when the proposed changes were put forward.\nJust 3 per cent of Hong Kong listings in the past decade, by market value, have been so-called \"new economy\" companies, compared with 47 per cent for the New York Stock Exchange, according to a discussion paper published by the HKEX in June.\nSome analysts said technical issues and underlying concerns about the dual-class structure still needed to be resolved and fine tuned.\n\"The main concern is about the protection to minority investors under the dual structure,\" said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities."}

Revenue: $17.05 billion vs. $16.35 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. The company's total revenue for the quarter was up 4 percent year over year. And for the full year revenue came in at $62.8 billion, which was up 6 percent.\nIntel's biggest segment, the Client Computing Group, brought in $9 billion, down 2 percent year over year, in the fourth quarter. But the second largest segment, the Data Center Group, grew 20 percent, with $5.6 billion in revenue. Both groups beat FactSet consensus estimates, which were $8.73 billion from the former and $5.09 billion from the latter, according to StreetAccount.\nThe company has faced pressure around its handling of the Meltdown and Spectre security vulnerabilities , which were disclosed on Jan. 3.\nThe issues affect chips made by several companies, although the Meltdown issue has had an especially large impact on Intel's processors. On Wednesday, a House committee said it had sent letters to Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and other tech leaders to learn about why Intel and other companies had withheld information about the issues for months before publicly announcing them.\nIndeed, Intel acknowledged controversies related to the security issues in the forward-looking statements sections of the earnings report :\nWe have and may continue to face product claims, litigation, and adverse publicity and customer relations from security vulnerabilities and\/or mitigation techniques, including as a result of side-channel exploits such as \"Spectre\" and \"Meltdown,\" which could adversely impact our results of operations, customer relationships,and reputation.

The company voluntarily stopped producing them in 1977.\nA corrected version of the story is below:\nWashington state suing agrochemical giant over PCB pollution\nWashington says it's the first U.S. state to sue the agrochemical giant Monsanto over pollution from PCBs\nBy GENE JOHNSON\nAssociated Press\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Washington has become the first U.S. state to sue the agrochemical giant Monsanto over pervasive pollution from PCBs, the toxic industrial chemicals that have accumulated in plants, fish and people around the globe for decades. The company said the case \"lacks merit.\"\nDemocratic Gov. Jay Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced the lawsuit at a news conference in downtown Seattle Thursday, saying they expect to win hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars from the company.\n\"It is time to hold the sole U.S. manufacturer of PCBs accountable for the significant harm they have caused to our state,\" Ferguson said, noting that the chemicals continue to imperil the health of protected salmon and orcas despite the tens of millions of dollars Washington has spent to clean up the pollution. \"Monsanto produced PCBs for decades while hiding what they knew about the toxic chemicals' harm to human health and the environment.\"\nThe suit arrives just days before Monsanto shareholders vote whether to accept a $57 billion buyout offer from Germany's Bayer. The extraordinary meeting of shareholders takes place just outside of St. Louis on Tuesday.\nPCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, were used in many industrial and commercial applications, including in paint, coolants, sealants and hydraulic fluids. Monsanto, based in St. Louis, produced them from 1935 until 1977, two years before they were banned by Congress.\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, PCBs have been shown to cause a variety of health problems, including cancer in animals as well as effects on the immune, nervous and reproductive systems.\nIn a company release, Monsanto spokesman Scott S. Partridge said that the \"case is experimental because it seeks to target a product manufacturer for selling a lawful and useful chemical four to eight decades ago that was applied by the U.S. government, Washington State, local cities, and industries into many products to make them safer. PCBs have not been produced in the U.S. for four decades, and Washington is now pursuing a case on a contingency fee basis that departs from settled law both in Washington and across the country. Most of the prior cases filed by the same contingency fee lawyers have been dismissed, and Monsanto believes this case similarly lacks merit.\"\nIn response to a similar lawsuit filed last year by the city of Spokane, Washington, Monsanto said a previous incarnation of the company produced the PCBs, which it said \"served an important fire protection and safety purpose.\"\n\"PCBs sold at the time were a lawful and useful product that was then incorporated by third parties into other useful products,\" Charla Lord, a company spokeswoman, wrote. \"If improper disposal or other improper uses created the necessity for clean-up costs, then these other third parties would bear responsibility for these costs.\"\nSeveral other cities \u2014 including Seattle, Portland, Oregon, and Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose, Long Beach and San Diego, California \u2014 have also sued Monsanto over PCB pollution, the Attorney General's Office said. Those cases are ongoing.\nFerguson, a Democrat, pointed to internal Monsanto documents that show the company long knew about the danger the chemicals posed. In 1937, an internal memo said testing on animals showed \"systemic toxic effects\" from prolonged exposure by inhaling PCB fumes or ingestion. In 1969, a company committee on PCBs noted, \"There is too much customer\/market need and selfishly too much Monsanto profit to go out.\"\n\"There is little probability that any action that can be taken will prevent the growing incrimination of specific polychlorinated biphenyls ... as nearly global environmental contaminants leading to contamination of human food (particularly fish), the killing of some marine species (shrimp), and the possible extinction of several species of fish eating birds,\" a committee memo said.\nNevertheless, Monsanto told officials around the country the contrary. In a letter to New Jersey's Department of Conservation that year, Monsanto wrote, \"Based on available data, manufacturing and use experience, we do not believe PCBs to be seriously toxic.\"\nFerguson said that infuriated him. He noted that his great-grandparents settled along Washington's Skagit River in the late 19th century. The Skagit was one of more than 100 water bodies in the state listed in the lawsuit as being polluted with PCBs.\n\"That river, the Skagit River, which my family depended on to a great degree in the 19th century as they homesteaded here, is now contaminated by PCBs, as are the fish,\" he said. \"That makes me mad.\"\nFerguson said his office had been in touch with counterparts in other states, but it remained unclear if other states would follow Washington's lead in suing the company.\nWashington's lawsuit seeks damages on several grounds, including product liability for what it described as Monsanto's failure to warn about the danger of PCBs; negligence; and even trespass, for injuring the state's natural resources.\nFollow Gene Johnson at https:\/\/twitter.com\/GeneAPseattle"}

Shooting incidents fell 22 percent and the number of shooting victims fell by 892 people, a 21 percent drop. Meanwhile, gun arrests increased 27 percent and police reported seizing more than 8,600 illegal weapons. \nPolice attributed the drop to putting more officers on the streets, investing in new technology and a smarter policing strategy. \nThe city was also coming off a high baseline after the number of homicides in 2016, which represented a nearly 60 percent spike from the previous year. \nThe United States\u2019 third largest city still ranks No. 1 in murders, with more than the two largest cities combined. New York and Los Angles each had fewer than 300 homicides in 2017. \nOverall crime for other offenses - including sexual assault, robbery, aggravated battery, burglary and vehicle theft - was down 2 percent, police said. \n\u201cI am proud of the progress our officers made in reducing gun violence all across the city in 2017, but none of us are satisfied,\u201d Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in the report. \u201cIn 2018, we are going to work to build on the progress we made last year - to reduce gun violence, to save lives and to find justice for victims.\u201d \nChicago initiated police reforms in 2017 after a federal investigation found officers routinely violated people\u2019s civil rights, citing excessive force and racially discriminatory conduct.

REUTERS\/Joshua Lott\/File Photo \nThe city hired more than 1,100 new police officers in 2017, and the department issued a new policy on use of force. \nCrime fell by 43 percent in Englewood district and 26 percent in Harrison, the first two districts to employ so-called Strategic Decision Support Centers, police said.

With $34.7 billion in assets, the funds make up a small but growing part of the $3.5 trillion ETF industry, according to ETF.com.\nBut the effort by Direxion to bring them into the shadowy world of digital currency is raising some concern on Wall Street. The firm filed its application with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 4, starting a process that those familiar with it say could take six to nine months.\n\"That would be insane for them to actually approve this. Then they're putting a rubber stamp on it as an asset, and I don't think governments want to go there yet,\" said Michael Cohn, chief investment strategist at Atlantis Asset Management. \"It just seems as though it's not something I'd want to put my clients into in any way, shape or form. You can only be embarrassed.\"\nshow chapters 2018 ETF market predictions 10:54 AM ET Wed, 3 Jan 2018 | 03:38 While it's far too early to tell what kind of chance Direxion has for gaining approval, it's important to understand what the proposed funds are and what they are not.\nTheir names are Direxion Daily Bitcoin Bear 1X Shares, Direxion Daily Bitcoin 1.25X Bull Shares, Direxion Daily Bitcoin 1.5 Bull Shares, Direxion Daily Bitcoin 2X Bull Shares and Direxion Daily Bitcoin 2X Bear Shares. Direxion did not respond to a request for comment.\nIf approved, the latter four shares would use leverage to replicate the daily price movements of bitcoin by 1.25, 1.5 and two times respectively. The bear fund would effectively \"short\" bitcoin, or capitalize on declines in price.\nHowever, the funds wouldn't be tied to the price of bitcoin per se but rather the futures price traded on the Cboe and CME. As such, the Direxion application points out that the funds \"should not be expected to track the performance of the target benchmark for any period longer than one business day.\"\n\"There are a lot of conflicting attitudes about this thing. I don't think the SEC can wrap their arms around this,\" Cohn said. \"It's not an asset class, it's not a currency. It's going to be evolved into a technology. As to whether that technology is viable, that remains to be seen.\"\nIndeed, Merrill Lynch recently raised eyebrows when it slapped a ban on bitcoin trading , while other Wall Street principals such as J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink have decried it as well.\n\"Can you imagine what a 2X bitcoin put or call is going to do? It's going to be amazing volatility,\" said Nick Colas, a bitcoin watcher and co-founder of DataTrek Research. \"It's eye-watering.\"\nColas said he sees the attempts at leveraging bitcoin as part of traders' quest for volatility, which has been noticeably missing from most of the market but is pretty much a daily fact of life for cryptocurrencies.\n\"This is the analog of the search for volatility,\" he said. \"Obviously, bitcoin does have a lot of volatility on its own. This is an attempt to create a product that has some volatility that leverages that.\"\nHowever, the Direxion efforts could represent just another step in the maturation process for cryptocurrencies, whose popularity has exploded over the past year. The top five offerings alone \u2014 bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and cardano \u2014 have a combined market cap of over half a trillion dollars, according to CoinMarketCap. Some 40 cryptos are worth more than $1 billion each.\nWatchers of the growing space figured it was only a matter of time before bitcoin ETF applications accelerated after the CME and Cboe greenlighted futures trading.\n\"We're seeing different measures and steps and approaches to attempt to further legitimize digital currency. This is part of the reason why I say digital currency is here to stay,\" said Sheila Warren, the World Economic Forum's head of blockchain, which is the technology that powers cryptocurrencies.\n\"Institutional investors and others are going to respond to [the Direxion funds]. That's what's intended,\" she added. \"Is that a good thing or a bad thing? That's a matter of opinion.\"\nWarren said the SEC will apply consumer protection principles when evaluating applications from Direxion and others. The commission thus far has taken a fairly dim view of bitcoin-related ETFs, but that was before futures trading began.\nWith price discovery more attainable, that could push the SEC to take another look. The commission does not comment on ongoing applications.\n\"There's going to be a lot of ETFs getting approved this year,\" said David Drake, founder and chairman of LDJ Capital. \"I don't think it's going to be oversaturated. The market can handle quite a few of them.\"\nDrake said he expects the SEC to be \"very careful\" when reviewing the Direxion application as well as what he expects to be a fairly large flow of other applicants this year.\nWATCH: Direxion isn't the only firm looking to launch bitcoin-related ETFs show chapters Bitcoin expert Brian Kelly launches a suite of crypto ETFs 8:20 PM ET Thu, 4 Jan 2018 | 01:17"}

Overdue loans - those not yet technically considered bad - reached 3.4 trillion yuan. Many analysts estimate actual amounts are much higher.\nLoan write-offs by commercial lenders, one indication of how deeply banks are cleaning house, jumped 50 per cent to about 1.4 trillion yuan in 2016, according to estimates by UBS analyst Jason Bedford.\nAn initial wave of foreign interest in China\u2019s bad loans a decade ago, led by big western banks, faded as deals failed to materialize and legal uncertainties multiplied.\nBut China\u2019s distressed-debt market has become more commercialized since then. Once the monopoly of the Big Four asset management companies established in 1999 to take over bad loans from the country\u2019s biggest lenders, the market today includes at least 55 regional managers while sales channels for bad loans now include online auctions, over-the-counter trades at local asset exchanges as well as NPL securitization.\n\u201cThe market has broadened,\u201d said Phil Groves, president of DAC Management LLC, a China-focused alternative investment manager and bad-loan servicing company that was bought by Blackstone last year. \u201cThere\u2019s more to buy, bigger portfolios, and different types of credit available.\u201d\nBlackstone acquired its first-ever Chinese commercial loan portfolio for $195 million in August - the same month that Bain Capital Credit did its first-ever deal with the purchase of $200 million in mostly real estate backed loans in the coastal province of Jiangsu.\nBain is now looking at other real estate-backed portfolios and building a loan servicing team to handle future deals, said Kei Chua, Bain\u2019s Hong Kong-based managing director.\n\u2018LOCALIZED BUSINESS\u2019\nGlobal distressed-debt players said they\u2019re encouraged by ongoing legal and structural changes in China - particularly in coastal regions - that has seen the emergence of professional appraisers and brokers, databases to check asset titles and liens, and greater certainty in the courts.\nForeign investors have for now mostly stuck to real estate deals because that market is better established with easily-valued collateral. Oaktree\u2019s latest portfolio, consisting of 178 loans in China\u2019s Pearl River Delta, is mostly but not entirely property-backed, according to Alpha & Leader\u2019s Rao.\nChina\u2019s bad loans market is, however, dominated by local distressed funds, many of which set up in the last two years, fund managers and advisers said, which has increased competition and raised NPL prices.\nA national industry association set up just two years ago has grown to more than 600 members from 200 initially.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a national market,\u201d said Deng Yanshan, executive director for investment at Lakeshore Capital, a domestic asset manager which oversees 2.5 billion yuan in funds. \u201cThis is still a localized business that\u2019s based in provinces, counties and cities.\u201d\nInternational firms must also deal with currency controls and related government approvals - creating an execution risk, particularly on timing and hedging costs, that their local rivals do not have to bear.\nBut Ted Osborn, an NPL specialist partner at PwC in Hong Kong, said the outlook for global distressed asset buyers remains good. \u201cWhen China gets serious and needs to start selling big chunks of bad loans, foreigners are still the only ones with organized capital to do it.\u201d\nReporting By Matthew Miller; Additional reporting by Engen Tham in Shanghai; Editing by Jennifer Hughes and Muralikumar Anantharaman\n "}

Yet even with his award-winning music career and success at raising global awareness about HIV\/AIDS, John admits he's had his highs and lows career-wise.\n\"There is never a straight line to success and there wasn't for me,\" the singer stated in an opinion piece recently published on the World Economic Forum's (WEF) website.\nNext week, he will be honored for his leadership in the fight against HIV\/AIDS at WEF Summit's 2018 Crystal Awards in Davos , Switzerland. In light of this, John has taken to WEF's website to extend some words of wisdom on the challenges he's faced during his career.\nHere are five leadership lessons that Elton John has learned from his \" darkest hours .\"\nLesson 1: Discover and follow your passions For the five-time Grammy winner, John discovered his passion for music at the age of three. Even though John ended up having a career that's spanned five decades to date, obstacles did arise.\nAccording to John, his father considered a music career as \"an outrageous, unacceptable thing\" to pursue \u2014 however, that didn't stop him from following his dreams.\n\"I stuck at it and I found that I loved it. It offered joy and material abundance beyond my wildest dreams.\"\nJonathan Leibson | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images Elton John performs at the Andrea Bocelli show Lesson 2: Have moral integrity that survives triumph and failure With success often comes fame, and while many may see this as rewarding, others see fame as a curse.\nEnter lesson number two: \"A good leader has a moral integrity that survives both success and failure\" \u2014 a lesson John admits he learned the hard way.\n\"My essential humanity began to dissolve into an excess of drugs and alcohol. Fame, which at first sight looks like a blessing, soon revealed itself as also a curse. I am afraid I reacted very badly.\"\nJohn has been open about his troubles in the past, explaining in his book \"Love Is the Cure\" how he took cocaine during the 1980s. Even in the darkest of times, however, John notes it's possible to change.\nLesson 3: The future is 'always in your hands' At his \"lowest point\", the singer met Ryan White and his mother Jeanne. Ryan had been diagnosed with AIDS at the age of 13 , having contracted the virus through a blood transfusion .\nRyan and his mother, however, fought for his right to return to school, while pushing back against AIDS-related discrimination. Ryan's story garnered national attention, with the news leading to the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act being passed by Congress in 1990, just months after Ryan died.\n\"I was entirely humbled as I watched Ryan and Jeanne battle stigma, discrimination and hatred with the most total grace. Their ability to cope with real adversity helped inspire me to turn my own life around,\" John wrote, describing Ryan as \"the spark\" that helped him kick his addictions \u2014 leading him to launch the Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF).\nLesson 4: Acknowledging common humanity Theo Wargo | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images Elton John AIDS Foundation commemorates its 25th year and honors founder Sir Elton John during New York fall gala The global discussion and awareness on HIV\/AIDS has transformed dramatically since EJAF was founded in 1992, with more people having access to support today.\n\"There is nothing more profound, nothing more powerful than a recognition of common humanity,\" John said, describing how society developed from turning a blind eye, to becoming more supportive, expressing it as a \" process of healing .\"\nEJAF has raised over $400 million to challenge discrimination and provide support to many HIV\/AIDS programs, yet John notes that these services remain under threat.\nLesson 5: Hope can be answered and progress can triumph HIV remains a huge public health issue, with 1 million HIV-related deaths in 2016 alone, according to the World Health Organization (WHO ). While over 36.5 million people were recorded as living with HIV at the end of 2016, only 54 percent of adults and 43 percent of children affected currently have lifelong access to antiretroviral therapy, WHO said.\nJohn underlined these statistics in the op-ed , explaining how services are currently at risk, while injustice and violence still affects several communities. Looking back at concerts and activism movements, he remains hopeful, however, recounting how group effort from different communities has helped combat stigma and misinformation.\n\"That process of bonding begins with the embrace of our common humanity. There is no greater lesson,\" he said.\nRead Elton John's entire opinion piece on the World Economic Forum's website.\nCheck out the world leaders and celebrities that are going to Davos this year Larry Busacca | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images Like this story?

Aaron P. Bernstein\/Bloomberg via Getty Images By Reuters 11:32 PM EST \nThe head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a \u201cfiscal conservative\u201d on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. \nIn keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS\u2019\u201cFace the Nation,\u201d drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. \nWhen they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. \nPresident Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense \u201cdiscretionary\u201d spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. \n\u201cThe (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: \u2018We\u2019re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending \u2026 by about 7 percent,'\u201d Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. \n\u201cNow, Democrats are saying that\u2019s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don\u2019t see where the rationale is. \u2026 Eventually you run out of other people\u2019s money,\u201d he said. \nMeadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party\u2019s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. \n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,\u201dDemocratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS . \nCrowley said the Republican tax bill would require the United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. \n\u201cThis is one of the least \u2026 fiscally responsible bills we\u2019ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we\u2019re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,\u201d Crowley said. \nRepublicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years, will boost the economy and job growth. \u2018Entitlement Reform\u2019 \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or \u201centitlement reform,\u201d as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. \nIn Republican parlance, \u201centitlement\u201d programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. \nDemocrats seized on Ryan\u2019s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. \nBut the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. \nDemocrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the \u201cDreamers,\u201d people brought illegally to the country as children. \nTrump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. \nThe president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. \nFor more on the 2018 U.S. budget, see Fortune\u2019s video: \nRepresentative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. \u201cWe need to do DACA clean,\u201d she said. \nOn Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. \nTrump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

It\u2019s not known whether criminals have been able to carry out such attacks as neither Meltdown nor Spectre leave any traces in log files.\nIntel says it has started providing software and firmware updates to mitigate the security issues. ARM has also said it was working with AMD and Intel on security fixes.\nFINDING A FIX The discovery was originally reported by online tech journal The Register. As a result of that report, research on the defect was published a week earlier than the manufacturers had planned, before some had time to work out a complete fix.\nThe Graz team had already been working on a tool to defend against attempts to steal secrets from kernel memory.\nIn a paper presented last June they called it KAISER, or Kernel Address Isolation to have Side-channels Effectively Removed.\nThe Intel logo is displayed on computer screens at SIGGRAPH 2017 in Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 31, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake As the name suggests, KAISER seeks to defend the kernel memory from a so-called side-channel attack that exploits a design feature of modern processors that increases their speed.\nThis involves processors executing tasks \u201cout-of-order\u201d, and not in the sequence received. If the CPU makes the right speculative call, time is saved. Get it wrong and the out-of-order task is cancelled and no time is lost.\nResearcher Anders Fogh wrote in a subsequent blog that it might be possible to abuse so-called speculative execution in order to read kernel memory. He was not able to do so in practice, however. ( bit.ly\/2vpkut0 )\nRESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE Only after the December self-hacking episode did the significance of Graz team\u2019s earlier work become clear. It turned out that the KAISER tool presented an effective defence against Meltdown.\nThe team quickly got in touch with Intel and learned that other researchers - inspired in part by Fogh\u2019s blog - had made similar discoveries.\nThey were working under so-called responsible disclosure, where researchers inform affected companies of their findings to give them time to prepare \u2018patches\u2019 to repair flaws they have exposed.\nThe key players were independent researcher Paul Kocher and the team at a company called Cyberus Technology, said Gruss, while Jann Horn at Google Project Zero came to similar conclusions independently.\n\"We merged our efforts in mid-December with the team around Paul Kocher and the people from Cyberus Technology to work on two solid publications on Meltdown and Spectre,\" said Gruss. ( www.meltdownattack.com )\nGruss had not even been aware of the work Horn was doing. ( here )\n\u201cJann Horn developed all of this independently - that\u2019s incredibly impressive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe developed very similar attacks, but we were a team of 10 researchers.\u201d\nThe wider team said patches for Meltdown, based on KAISER, had been readied for Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc operating systems, as well as for the Linux open-source system.\nThere is as yet no fix for Spectre, which tricks programmes into leaking their secrets but is viewed as a harder exploit for a hacker to carry out.\nAsked which of the two flaws posed the greater challenge, Gruss said: \u201dThe immediate problem is Meltdown.\n\u201cAfter that it is going to be Spectre. Spectre is more difficult to exploit but also to mitigate. So in the long run I\u2019d bet on Spectre.\u201d\n(This story has been refiled to remove incorrect detail on name given to app in paragraph 13, amends detail about blog in paragraph 17.)\nEditing by Georgina Prodhan and Edmund Blair\n "}

He's a co-founder of the non-profit Open AI, which aims to prevent dangerous artificial intelligence, and the founder of Neuralink, a company working to connect the brain with computers. He has a lot going on. \nAnd yet, the billionaire entrepreneur is not too busy to listen to his customers. \nThe day after Christmas, in a single tweet, Musk thanked Tesla customers for their support and asked what the company can do to improve. The tweet inspired an avalanche of responses. Wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to Tesla owners for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail. So much blood, sweat & tears from the Tesla team went into creating cars that you'd truly love. I hope you do. How can we improve further? \nThe tweet was \"liked\" 137,000 times (as of the publishing of this story). Musk's responses to user feedback revealed he is \"dying\" to make a Tesla pick-up truck . He individually responded to about a dozen other tweets indicating various technological advances , like confirming an upgraded version of the autopilot software is on its way. \nCustomers were impressed with Musk's willingness to interact with them. The next car I purchase will be a Tesla. What a creative, innovative, responsive CEO. \nIndeed, listening to customers is a core tenet of being a successful entrepreneur and business owner, and Musk isn't the only one who does it. \n\"My business philosophy is listen to your employees, listen to your customers.

It's not, however, going to solve all his problems. \nMusk is spending aggressively to reach his ambitious goals . His bold predictions and big spending have some industry watchers nervous, suspicious of his ability to succeed. \n\"To believe in the story, at this point you're making a James Bond trade,\" portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management Christian Hoffmann told CNBC at the end of November , speaking of Tesla. \"The company needs to dodge the avalanche, avoid the gunfire, ski off the cliff, pull off the ripcord on their parachute and glide to safety so that they can save the world.\" \nSee also: "}

The absence of vegetation and roots in burned-out hillsides and canyons makes them more susceptible to mudslides and even landslides, officials said.\n\"To think that there won't be flooding would be very foolish,\" Tom Fayram, water resources deputy director for Santa Barbara County Public Works, said in an interview Thursday. \"We've actually started while the fire is still burning clearing about 11 debris basins.\"\nThe region's first major winter storm could bring rain to Ventura and Santa Barbara counties where the Thomas fire has burned as well as precipitation to residential areas in Los Angeles where other recent blazes have left hillsides bare of vegetation and prone to mudslides and flooding.\nshow chapters The California wildfires are the worst this firefighter has seen 8:14 PM ET Tue, 12 Dec 2017 | 02:19 \"We have a lot of steep, fire-denuded hill slopes where a lot of heavy rain at once could cause flooding and debris flows,\" said Paul Meznarich, U.S. Forest Service spokesman for the Thomas fire, told CNBC. \"We want rain but we don't want a lot of it coming down hard in a short period of time because that brings its own problems with it.\"\nThe National Weather Service is forecasting there could be about 2 to 4 inches of rain in the foothills and mountains areas of some of the recent burned areas from the approaching storm. There also is significant rain forecast for the coastal and other areas of the region.\nJayme Laber, a hydrologist at the NWS office in Oxnard, California, said forecast models are showing that rain rates Tuesday into Wednesday in recent burn areas could approach a rate of about one-half-inch an hour, or enough to trigger flashfloods and debris flows.\n\"Any recent burn area is considered a risk for mud and debris flow in the event there is a large amount of rain,\" said Capt. Erik Scott of the Los Angeles Fire Department.\nWildfires often happen in September and October in Southern California and give local public works agencies time to prepare for the winter rains. However, given the Thomas fire started in December it has left little time for communities to prepare for the major storm system next week.\nGene Blevins | Reuters Fire fighters attack the Thomas Fire\u2019s north flank with backfires as they continue to fight a massive wildfire north of Los Angeles, near Ojai , California, U.S., December 9, 2017. Overall, the Thomas fire \u2014 the largest wildfire in California history \u2014 has scorched nearly 282,000 acres, or about 440 square miles, and destroyed or damaged more than 1,300 structures. The blaze, which also has caused losses to agriculture exceeding $171 million , was 92 percent contained as of Thursday morning.\nIn Ventura County, the fire destroyed homes from Santa Paula to Ventura and left bare slopes along a coastal highway that connects Ventura to Santa Barbara.\nSome of the burned areas have a history of major debris flows and flooding after fires.\nFor example, the western Ventura County town of La Conchita, where slopes burned last month, experienced a deadly mudslide in 2005 after rains. That event killed 10 people and destroyed more than a dozen homes.\n\"The whole face of that slope [in La Conchita] burned,\" said Jim O'Tousa, a Ventura County geologist. \"We are concerned about debris flows off that slope and out of the canyons on either side.\"\nAnother potential danger is hillsides that burned above Summerland, Montecito and Carpinteria in Santa Barbara County.\nThe Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors held a special meeting Wednesday to discuss the flooding risk and heard how county workers are already clearing debris basins from burned areas in preparation for the storm.\nMeantime, in LA County where the so-called Creek and Skirball fires burned homes and hills in December there are preparations underway for the approaching storm. Also, more than 100 fire stations in the LA area are providing sandbags for residents to use as a way to protect homes.\nBesides December's fires, LA Fire's Scott said a concern with the approaching storm is areas burned in September's so-called La Tuna fire \u2014 the largest acreage fire in LA city history. Even so, local agencies have had more time to perform field work to shore up those burn areas that may cause mudslides.\nWATCH: Wildfires getting worse and more expensive to fight show chapters Wildfires are getting worse and more expensive to fight than ever before 10:47 AM ET Tue, 12 Dec 2017 | 01:40"}

Still, there's one question about money that always drives her crazy, she writes in a recent blog post: \"Would I be happier if I had more?\" \n\"I am always floored \u2026 when I am talking to groups and I get this question. I try not to get too worked up,\" she says, \"but any of you, who have come to hear me speak, know this when I get a bit animated. \n\"This way of thinking makes me crazy.\" \nMoney alone, she says, will not make you happy. \"Yes, you need to have enough money to pay your basic living costs . But making more money, having more money than that, does not guarantee you will be happier. I know plenty of very wealthy people. They are so not happy .\" show chapters 9:20 AM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 | 00:53 \nStudies back up that claim . Experts say that happiness only increases with wealth up to a point : The correlation peaks when you earn $75,000 per year. \"The difference the marginal dollar makes in reducing negative emotions starts to fall off around $70,000, is very low by $160,000 and hits zero around $200,000,\" reports CNBC . \nA recent review from the Harvard Business School asked more than 4,000 millionaires to rank their life satisfaction and happiness. Its findings: Even the super-rich aren't always satisfied. \nThat may be because \"what matters for your well-being is what you're doing with the minutes and days of your life,\" not necessarily how much money you have,\" Elizabeth Dunn, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia, tells CNBC Make It . \n\"If you have a lot of money and a lot of nice stuff, but you're spending your time doing things that you dislike, then your minute-to-minute happiness and overall happiness is likely to be pretty low.\" show chapters 11:50 AM ET Wed, 28 June 2017 | 01:04 \nBerkshire Hathaway chairman and chief executive officer Warren Buffett, whose net worth is nearing $90 billion, agrees . \n\"I can buy anything, basically,\" Buffett said on PBS Newshour. \"I have been on 400-foot yachts, and I have ... lived the life a little bit with people that have 10 homes and everything.\" Yet Buffett still lives in the same house he bought in 1958. And \"for me,\" he says, \"it's because it's got memories, and people come back, and all that sort of thing.\" \nThere are ways you can strive for happiness and financial success at the same time. For instance, a study of more than 195,000 American workers shows that making friends at work can not only make you happier, it can also make you a better employee. \nAnd building \" rich relationships ,\" like the one Buffett and longtime friend Bill Gates have shared for years, with people you admire who can mentor or encourage you, can help you reach personal, professional and financial goals. \nOverall, though, as Orman writes, happiness doesn't come from making or having money. Instead, it's \"waiting for you in the time you spend with loved ones. [It] comes from celebrating what you have today, and not getting all worked up about what you don't have.\" "}

But the search to replace his ruined paraphernalia would lead the Connecticut dad to launch a side hustle that now nets him over $100,000 a year. \nIt started with the hockey pants. Fanelli came across a used pair from the University of Connecticut's team at a local sports store. At $65, they were half the price of new ones \u2014 and arguably cooler. \n\"[Selling] used hockey equipment from schools? That's kind of neat,\" Fanelli recalls thinking in the store. \"It was kind of like a light bulb went off and I was like, 'I think I could do this [too].'\" \nBut how he would build his own business wasn't entirely clear. As a 44-year-old father of three daughters, aged 3, 7 and 9, who works as a full-time salesman at a transport company and coaches high school hockey, time to do anything else was hard to come by. CNBC | Andrea Kramar Eric Fanelli has cut down on his time playing in two hockey leagues to focus on his side hustle as a hockey equipment reseller. \nIn the precious hours he could find, Fanelli leaned into his hockey network to meet equipment managers at colleges in the Northeast. His pitch was simple: \"I'll give you money for gear you no longer use.\" He told them the story of how his life revolved around hockey \u2014 he was a player as a kid and in college at Southern New Hampshire University, and now he was coaching. That he always wanted to own his own hockey business. \n\"The head coach of the Boston University women's team thought my story was interesting,\" Fanelli says. For his first purchase, in 2015, Fanelli drove two hours from Connecticut to Boston to buy spare gloves, pads and jerseys. He paid $750. CNBC | Mary Stevens Eric Fanelli pulls down a used practice jersey he's sold on Sideline Swap from his Rocky Hill, Connecticut warehouse. \n\"I didn't have any business checks or anything like that,\" he remembers. \"Having three little girls, my wife had checks from the movie 'Frozen' so that's what I gave the guy and he kind of laughed at me.\" \nFrozen checks aside, he had just started his business, Fanelli Hockey, with inventory from one of the best collegiate hockey programs in the country. And it didn't hurt that the team had made an appearance at the national championship in 2013. \n\"I kind of marketed it as 'Today's a great day to buy some BU gear' on Facebook and before you knew it, it was all sold,\" for a profit of about $350, he says. Trips to other schools like Brown and Princeton soon followed, before Fanelli made the jump to buying gear from professional teams. A jersey from the Manchester Monarchs, the minor league affiliate of the Los Angeles Kings, for example, could buy for about $25 and re-sell for $65. \nTrip after trip, his house looked more and more like a sporting goods store with sticks and goalie pads scattered about. \"I didn't have a warehouse at that point so my basement was the storage facility,\" he says. \nWhen the hassle of listing items on Facebook became too much work six months in, he started selling on Sideline Swap , an online marketplace for sports gear. He saw his sales climb from just a few thousand in his first year to over $250,000 in 2017. CNBC | Mary Stevens Fanelli and his daughter work together in his basement to pack up a hockey stick he's sold. \nWhen the opportunity to buy $30,000 worth of used gear from the University of Michigan came up in July, Fanelli took out a loan with his credit card company (a promotional interest rate made it cost-effective). He flew to Ann Arbor, rented a truck and then drove 12 hours straight back home to unload his haul in his basement in the middle of the night. \n\"That is the hardest part when I leave for a weekend,\" says Fanelli, who also coaches his daughters' hockey teams between his once-a-month sourcing trips. \"I'm leaving the kids and that that's precious time that I'd like to get back with them, but they understand the sacrifice that I'm trying to make for everybody to do this full-time.\" \nNow, Fanelli spends 30 hours a week on the business, taking pictures of inventory, uploading descriptions and listing items to sell from the 1600-square-foot warehouse he had to lease late last year. He knows jumping ship on his day job would mean giving up perks like 401(k)-matching, a car allowance and healthcare to name a few. But Fanelli still plans to do it \u2014 for him, those comforts pale in comparison to building out a brand with his name attached to it. \n\"The pride behind that is pretty amazing,\" he says, adding it's shared by his kids. \"They have fun with it and they help me package quite a few items over the weekend.\" CNBC | Andrea Kramar Fanelli waits for his daughter to board the bus to school before heading to his day job and his warehouse. \nAnd perhaps even more important is the flexibility that his business could one day bring if sales continue to grow. Setting his own hours would mean having the luxury of being more present in his family's life. \n\"You know, being able to get my kids on the bus every day \u2026 having myself there when they get home from school and helping with their homework is just something that kind of fuels me.\" \nFor now, Fanelli estimates he's about $2,000 in additional sales per month from making the jump \u2014 a figure he says could be just a few months away at his current trajectory. \n\"I'm getting closer and closer every month to doing this as \u2026 my dream job,\" he says.

The interview, which would deal with a limited portion of questions, could take place within the next several weeks, the Post said, citing a person close to the president. \nSekulow and Dowd did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the Washington Post report. White House attorney Ty Cobb declined to comment on it, saying it was policy not to comment on communications with the special counsel\u2019s office. \nEarlier on Monday, a source familiar with the issue said discussions about Trump\u2019s possible testimony have been going on among lawyers. NBC News reported that Trump\u2019s attorneys were in discussions about the president being interviewed in connection with Mueller\u2019s Russia probe. \nCiting three people familiar with the situation, NBC said lawyers for Trump had met with representatives of Mueller\u2019s office in late December to discuss the logistics of any such interview. \nThey included the location and length of such an interview as well as legal standards and options for its format, including written responses instead of a formal sit-down, according to the network. \nThe spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office, Peter Carr, declined to comment on the report. \nMueller has been appointed by the Justice Department to investigate allegations of Russian meddling in the November 2016 election and possible collusion with Trump\u2019s campaign. \nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election to try to help Trump win. Russia has denied any meddling, and Trump has said there was no collusion. \nDemocratic U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal said in an interview with MSNBC television on Monday that he expected Mueller would try to talk to the president \u201cface-to-face.\u201d \nMueller\u2019s probe so far has led to two Trump associates, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and campaign aide George Papadopoulos, pleading guilty to lying to FBI agents. \nTwo others, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his associate, Richard Gates, were indicted on money laundering charges but have pleaded not guilty. \nTrump said on Saturday he was willing to speak with Mueller\u2019s team. \n\u201cThere\u2019s been no collusion; there\u2019s been no crime,\u201d he told reporters at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland. \u201cAnd, in theory, everybody tells me I\u2018m not under investigation.\u201d Additional reporting by Karen Freifeld and Mark Hosenball; writing by Susan Heavey and David Alexander; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Jonathan Oatis"}

This drive, he said, was fueled by his rivalry with Apple founder Steve Jobs.\nGetty Images Apple CEO Steve Jobs holds up the new iPhone that was introduced at Macworld on January 9, 2007 in San Francisco, California. \"Early on we were speed nuts, staying all night [at the office, thinking], 'Oh, you're five percent slower as a programmer? You don't belong here.' It was very hard-core,\" he told the magazine.\nIn the same interview, Microsoft's current CEO Satya Nadella discussed Gates' leadership style at Microsoft, noting that the billionaire has a way of making people want to do their best.\n\"Bill is a galvanizing force,\" said Nadella, who has held the CEO title since 2014 . \"Whenever somebody meets with Bill, they want to do their best work. You can't replicate that.\"\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has held the CEO position since the retail giant's 1996 launch, nearly 22 years ago.\nWhat started as a small e-commerce site has expanded rapidly in recent years, with Amazon's purchase of the grocery chain Whole Foods last year.

It rose 0.7 percent to 3,818 yuan a ton by the close. [IRONORE\/]\nThe new rules are a sign China will continue to deepen its efforts to push supply-side reform and reduce overcapacity in the sector.

FILE PHOTO: A China yuan note is seen in this illustration photo May 31, 2017. REUTERS\/Thomas White\/Illustration\/File Photo \nThe report sent U.S. Treasury yields to 10-month highs and sent the dollar lower. Economists cautioned, however, that China would not be able to make large changes to the composition of its reserves as it needs them to manage its renminbi exchange rate. \nChina has the world\u2019s biggest currency reserves, approximately $3 trillion, and is the biggest foreign holder of U.S. government debt, with $1.19 trillion in Treasuries as of October 2017, according to data from the Treasury Department. \nThe Bloomberg report, which cited people familiar with the matter without identifying their seniority or input into the report, quoted the sources as saying the market for U.S. government bonds is becoming less attractive relative to other assets. They also cited trade tensions with the United States as a reason to slow Treasury purchases, the report said. \nBloomberg said the Chinese officials did not specify why trade tensions would cause a cutback in Treasuries purchases. \nU.S. Treasury Undersecretary David Malpass, speaking to reporters in Brussels, dismissed any concerns about China\u2019s demand for U.S. Treasuries. \n\u201cThe U.S. Treasury market is a deep, robust market within the world and so we are confident that our economy, with the economy strengthening, that it will remain a deep, robust market,\u201d Malpass said when asked to comment on the report. \nMalpass, who heads international affairs for Treasury, also reiterated his concerns about China\u2019s emphasis on its state-owned enterprises and government subsidies that distort capital allocation. LITTLE ROOM TO MANEUVER \nChina\u2019s State Administration of Foreign Exchange did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on the Bloomberg report. The People\u2019s Bank of China could also not be reached for comment outside business hours. \nMajor government bond yields extended earlier gains after the report. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury US10YT=RR hit a 10-month high of 2.59 percent in European trade and was up 4 basis points on the day. That pushed the dollar to a six-week low against the Japanese yen. \nWall Street\u2019s major indexes fell, stalling the rally that marked the start of 2018. \nBut some economists noted that China had already eased Treasury holdings and would not be able to more aggressively reduce holdings without hurting its portfolio, given its need for stable and liquid dollar assets. \n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many places you can stick that money,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. \nChina uses its holdings of foreign currency bonds to keep its currency at the rate where it wants it, and given this desire for stability, there might not be much room for maneuver on the composition of its reserves. \nBut Ashworth noted that the move could serve as a warning that China could quickly shift U.S. borrowing costs higher if the Trump administration started a trade war with Beijing. \nThe administration is considering several new tariff moves in the coming weeks, including broad restrictions on steel and aluminum imports and punitive actions against China arising from an investigation into Beijing\u2019s intellectual property practices. \nThe report comes amid increasing nervousness about bond weakness after the Bank of Japan said on Tuesday it will trim its purchases of Japanese government bonds, raising speculation it will reduce its monetary stimulus this year. \n\u201cPeople were already jittery about Treasuries,\u201d said Aaron Kohli, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York, noting the Chinese news is \u201cpiling on.\u201d Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe, Tommy Wilkes, Saikat Chatterjee, Ritvik Carvalho in London; Karen Brettell and Saqib Ahmed in New York; David Lawder, Jason Lange and David Chance in Washington and Jan Strupczewski in Brussels; Writing by Frances Kerry; Editing by Sujata Rao and Nick Zieminski"}

This was true for roughly half of patients over age 90. \nDuring the next several years, 50 patients died. Not surprisingly, the largest percentage of deaths was among patients in their 90s. No one died of the skin cancers, however. \nIn more than one in three patients above age 80, and in more than half of those above 90, simply removing the lesion for biopsy left the patients cancer-free. In other words, the researchers say, \u201ca large minority of patients\u201d would not have needed more extensive treatments. \nTreatments for non-melanoma skin cancers range from immunomodulatory creams, to destructive therapies such as freezing, burning, shaving and lasers, to surgery, said Tholpady. \nFurther, his team points out, more than half of the patients who were in their 90s died within a year. \u201dThese small (cancers) would never have caused a problem,\u201d the authors write. Given that half of these oldest patients were free of cancer after their biopsies, \u201ca strong argument can be made for a watchful-waiting approach for the amenable nonagenarian,\u201d they add. \nDr. Brian Gastman, director of melanoma surgery at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, said a lot of money is spent every year on non-melanoma skin cancer, much of it in the elderly. \n\u201cParticularly in the oldest-old, life expectancy \u201cin theory would be much less than any non-melanoma skin cancer would take to actually cause death, and many are not generally life-threatening,\u201d Gastman told Reuters Health by an email. \nThe idea that some non-melanoma skin cancers in elderly patients can be monitored without formal treatment is \u201cintriguing,\u201d said Gastman, but the new data are not definitive enough to change the standard of care. \nThe authors agree. \n\u201cFuture studies are needed to investigate if a watchful-waiting approach is cost-effective and has higher patient satisfaction than surgical excision in this elderly population,\u201d they conclude. \nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2Cmo5db JAMA Surgery, online December 20, 2017."}

REUTERS\/Rupak De Chowdhuri\/File Photo In the current 2017\/18 season sugar mills in India, the world\u2019s biggest consumer of the sweetener, is expected to produce just enough to meet its annual consumption of about 25 million tonnes.\nHowever, output is expected to jump next season, which starts in October, raising the possibility of a drop in domestic prices. That could make it difficult for mills to pay millions of cane farmers on time, just as Prime Minister Narendra Modi prepares for a national election in early 2019.\nPreparing for the potential glut, the Indian government will ask both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh to lower their import tariffs for sugar exports from India, said the official, who asked to remain anonymous because he is not authorised to talk to media.\nAbout half a dozen Bangladesh refineries, which turn raw sugar into refined, or white, sugar could be interested in securing supplies from India, said Abinash Verma, director general of the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).\nBangladesh, which currently imports raw sugar from Brazil, the world\u2019s biggest producer, will find it easier and more economical to import from neighbouring India, Verma said.\nSri Lanka, which allows duty-free sugar imports from Pakistan, could also be keen to import white sugar from India, he said.\n\u201cBetween Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, India can look at exporting about 3 million tonnes, provided Colombo and Dhaka agree to India\u2019s request of concessional tariffs,\u201d Verma said.\nIndia, the world\u2019s biggest sugar producer behind Brazil, is likely to churn out more than 25.1 million tonnes in the current marketing season, according to the ISMA.\nHowever, plentiful rains in western and southern India are expected to boost 2018\/19 output.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get some concrete sense about next year\u2019s production in July,\u201d Verma said.\nIndia is likely to start the new marketing year on Oct. 1, with an opening stock of 4 million tonnes of sugar, almost unchanged from a year ago, he said.\nVerma played down talks of large-scale imports from Pakistan into India.\n\u201cSince there is hardly any price parity, we do not foresee bulk imports from Pakistan, with barely 2,000 tonnes shipped into India so far,\u201d Verma said.\nReporting by Mayank Bhardwaj; Editing by David Goodman\n "}

The property is fully leased to a publicly-traded global pharmaceutical distribution company through 2027. The tenant invested heavily in the property which is a mission critical facility servicing the southeast region. The purchase price was approximately $31 million.\nAtlanta is the largest economy in the Southeast U.S. and the region's hub for finance, commerce, communications, transportation, education and cultural activity. Atlanta has earned the reputation for being one of the most business-friendly cities in the U.S., with more than 75% of Fortune 1000 firms having operations in the metro area, and 15 of the Fortune 500 companies choosing Atlanta for their headquarters. The population of Atlanta is expected to grow by an average of 2.1% annually over the next five years according to economy.com , indicating the current growth rate among industrial tenants attracted to the local consumer base should continue.\nThe northeast submarket where Mason Mill Distribution Center is located is Atlanta's largest and has historically been the favorite of institutional investors and tenants. The close proximity to the Golden Triangle executive housing, access to skilled labor and the immediate interstate infrastructure provide an ideal location for higher employee count operations required by large, multinational tenants. This area has higher barriers to entry due to topography, few available developable land sites, and the increased resistance by municipalities to permit industrial development, which is curtailing new starts compared to other adjacent submarkets.\n\"We are pleased to add this high-quality industrial property to our portfolio, as we increase exposure to core assets in high-barrier-to-entry markets,\" said Allan Swaringen, President and CEO of JLL Income Property Trust. \"The fundamental tailwinds benefitting the industrial real estate sector are numerous, and we expect to continue to capture upside associated with this trend as long as it continues. This investment brings our aggregate industrial allocation to nearly $560 million and nearly six million square feet, and represents 23 percent of the value of the overall JLL Income Property Trust portfolio.\"\nMason Mill Distribution Center is a state-of-the-art distribution facility with best-in-class features, including 32-foot ceiling height, ESFR sprinklers, LED lighting, a cross-dock design, 100% air conditioned and also features 376 parking spots.\nJLL Income Property Trust is an institutionally managed, daily valued perpetual life real estate investment trust (REIT) that gives investors access to a growing portfolio of commercial real estate investments selected by an institutional investment management team and sponsored by one of the world's leading real estate services firms.\nFor more information on JLL Income Property Trust, please visit our website at www.jllipt.com .\nAbout JLL Income Property Trust (NASDAQ: ZIPTAX ; ZIPTMX ; ZIPIAX ; ZIPIMX ),\nJones Lang LaSalle Income Property Trust, Inc. is a daily valued perpetual life real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and manages a diversified portfolio of high quality, income-producing office, retail, industrial and apartment properties located primarily in the United States.

If you missed out on them, then the year was probably a disappointment,\u201d a senior banker said.\nM&A loan volume dropped 9% to US$240bn in 2017 as activity remained sporadic. This was despite the ready availability of bridge loan financing and quick and cheap refinancing through the bond market as well as the rising Schuldschein market.\nJumbo loans dominated and the five biggest loans of the year were all acquisition related.\nIn January, British American Tobacco closed the largest loan of the year, placing US$25bn of bridge loans and \u00a35.68bn (US$7.72bn)of forward starting revolving credit facilities backing its acquisition of the remaining 57.8% stake in Reynolds American it did not already own.\nIn March, UK consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser syndicated US$21.2bn-equivalent of loans supporting its US$17.9bn acquisition of US baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co.\nGerman infrastructure group Hochtief closed a \u20ac15bn (US$18.05bn)loan in November backing its \u20ac17.1bn bid for Spanish motorway operator Abertis, after Italian transport infrastructure company Atlantia backed its rival \u20ac17bn cash-and-shares bid in May with a \u20ac14.7bn loan.\nFinnish utility Fortum closed a \u20ac12bn loan in September backing its \u20ac8.05bn bid for German conventional generation and energy trading group Uniper.\nREFINANCING RETURNS Refinancing, traditionally the main driver of the EMEA syndicated loan market, rebounded strongly in 2017 up 31% to US$564bn making up a substantial 63% of the market, as the second half of the year saw some companies refinance early while conditions remained positive.\nIn 2016 refinancing made up just 47% of the market as most companies remained comfortable having locked in low-priced loans until 2019 to 2021.\nA number of big hitters came back to refinance their loans either through new credit facilities or amend and extends, including Nestle, which completed its annual renewal of \u20ac11bn-equivalent of loans in October.\nItalian utility Enel signed a \u20ac10bn loan refinancing in December, replacing a \u20ac9.44bn facility that was due to mature in February 2020. Prior to that, German car maker BMW signed a \u20ac6bn refinancing in October on benchmark pricing.\nBanks expect more refinancing in 2018 as 2019 maturities loom and ahead of potential interest rate rises and a possible tapering of the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programmes.\nLEVERAGED FRENZY Leveraged lending rose nearly 40% to US$256bn in 2017 compared to US$182.72bn in 2016, reaching a 10-year high not seen since the financial crisis.\nThe first half of 2017 saw volume of US$142bn as borrowers took advantage of deep liquidity to reprice and refinance existing facilities on a more attractive basis.\nFirst half activity was enough to bolster total annual volume and compensate for a decline in second half volume, which totalled US$114bn, as sponsors and investors focused on new money transactions.\nThe pickup in event-driven financings during the second half of 2017 pushed buyout activity to US$49bn above the US$41bn seen in 2016. Fewer but larger buyout transactions came to the market in 2017 with 100 deals completed in the year, down from 120 in 2016.\nA number of public-to-privates provided some jumbo financings, much to the relief of new and existing CLOs and managed accounts desperate for new paper.\n\u201cRefinancings and repricings dominated the first half of 2017 but buyout activity picked up in the second half providing some much needed new blood to Europe\u2019s leveraged loan market. Take privates were the buzz word in the second half,\u201d a senior loan banker said.\nA \u20ac2.95bn-equivalent financing backing US private equity firm Hellman & Friedman\u2019s DKr33.1bn (US$5.3bn) take-private of payments firm Nets was the largest leveraged loan of the year.\nThe financing comprised a \u20ac1.86bn term loan B, which was the largest single tranche euro term loan B since the financial crisis, sources said. Despite its size, the borrower paid a tight margin of 325bp over Euribor, the tighter end of 325bp-350bp pricing guidance, characterising a year where demand far outweighed supply.\nOther large P2Ps included a US$2.6bn cross-border loan financing that closed in November and backed the buyout of UK-based payment processing company Paysafe as well as a \u20ac1.4bn loan and a \u00a3266m loan for German generic drugmaker Stada that formed part of a larger loan and bond financing backing its \u20ac5.2bn buyout.\nStada was the largest leveraged loan of the third quarter, followed by a \u20ac1.09bn and \u00a3200m term loan for Dutch-headquartered bottle manufacturer Refresco, backing its acquisition of the bottling activities of listed Canada-based Cott Corp.\nThe pipeline has been building and the first quarter of 2018 looks set for a good start with the likes of an approximate \u20ac5.5bn leveraged financing backing US private equity firm KKR\u2019s \u20ac6.83bn acquisition of Unilever\u2019s margarine and spreads business. The leveraged loan element will total up to \u20ac3.9bn-equivalent, sources said.\nHSBC topped the 2017 EMEA syndicated loan bookrunner league table, with a US$41.88bn market share and 167 deals. BNP Paribas claimed second place with US$38.45bn and 223 deals, while Deutsche Bank was third with a US$35.94bn market share and 118 deals.

Traders noted that, despite comments from ECB President Mario Draghi on Thursday afternoon, they remain convinced that easy monetary policy in the region is coming to an end.\n\"Draghi failed to surprise the market,\" Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank, told CNBC over the phone. \"The economic data is too strong,\" she said, adding that investors are therefore convinced that the central bank will have to tighten its policy, despite giving the opposite message on Thursday.\nAfter a routine rate decision for the euro zone's central bank, Draghi spoke at a press conference Thursday, telling reporters that the recent volatility in the exchange rate is a \"source of uncertainty.\" He added that it would therefore require monitoring.\nshow chapters Draghi: Inflation will converge close to our target 6 Hours Ago | 01:46 However, he used the same wording back in September \u2014 a repetition that markets perceived as a lack of concern over the strength of the euro and thus an indication that the ECB will end up tightening its policy. Draghi nonetheless reiterated that the bank will keep its stimulus for as long as needed and stated that there are \"very few chances\" that it will change interest rates this year.\nThe euro has been on an upward trend against other currencies, including the U.S. dollar, for the past few weeks as the region's economy keeps improving and political risks dissipate. However, a stronger euro could hurt European exports and affect inflation in the euro zone \u2014 which the central bank has tried to support in the last few years \u2014 potentially prompting a change in its policy.\nNo change in policy Earlier on Thursday, the ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged. Its interest rate on the main refinancing operations, the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility were kept at zero, 0.25 and -0.40 percent, respectively.\nshow chapters Swiss National Bank chairman: Do not see a currency war 5 Hours Ago | 00:42 Earlier in the month, the ECB's December meeting minutes said the central bank should revisit its communication stance in \"early\" 2018, prompting market participants to forecast policymakers were preparing to reduce their massive monetary stimulus program. The minutes, which were published on January 11 , immediately pushed the euro more than 0.7 percent higher against the dollar, extending the single currency's rally throughout the opening days of the calendar year.\nBroad economic recovery By the end of trade on Wednesday, the euro had gained more than 2 percent since the start of 2018, as a broadening recovery bolstered expectations the ECB may be forced to unwind its policy stimulus sooner than forecast. The euro zone is seeing its best economic growth in a decade, leading economists and policymakers to upwardly revise their economic forecasts for several major European countries. Late last year, the ECB increased its growth forecast for 2018 to 2.3 percent, up from 1.8 percent previously.\nKrisztian Bocsi | Bloomberg | Getty Images The euro sign sculpture illuminated near the former European Central Bank headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany. Nonetheless, the ECB has long-struggled to bring up core inflation to its aim of about 2 percent and the central bank is not projected to meet its target level until 2020 at the earliest.\nLate last year, the bank said headline inflation would be at 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.2 percent in 2018.\nIn October, the ECB announced a reduction in the level of its monthly purchases from 60 billion euros ($71 billion) to 30 billion euros. At that time, the bank also said that its quantitative easing program would stay in place until September 2018. It kept the door open to further extensions in the program, depending on the economic conditions of the euro area."}

GMP is an approximately 215-mile, multi-play crude oil transportation system located in the STACK\/Merge, Granite Wash and Mississippi Lime plays, delivering crude oil to a one million-barrel GMP-owned storage facility at Cushing, Oklahoma.\nNavigator is currently expanding the GMP system, constructing approximately 44 miles of additional pipeline further into the STACK play, and an additional 250,000 barrels of storage capacity. The expansion is expected to be operational in February 2018. Once complete, the GMP system will include pipeline capacity of approximately 210,000 barrels of oil per day, and approximately 1.8 million barrels of storage.\nIn support of the significant volume growth within the STACK\/Merge and Woodford resources plays, Navigator plans to further expand the footprint and overall capacity of the GMP system. Working with producer partners, substantial new gathering infrastructure is also anticipated. The considerable scale of the existing GMP system and its ability to segregate multiple grades of crude allows Navigator to offer customers a fulsome, differentiated suite of services to transport and store crude oil.\nNavigator Leadership\nNavigator is led by a majority of the same leadership team that successfully guided the company to a full asset sale to NuStar Energy L.P. (NuStar) in 2017. The seasoned management team is led by Matt Vining as chief executive officer, and includes two additions: Nick Kubala as vice president of engineering, and Vidal Rosa as vice president of operations.\nKubala brings 10 years of engineering experience in a variety of different roles to the Navigator team. Prior to Navigator, he was manager of engineering and construction at Align Midstream LLC, where he was responsible for the engineering, development, and construction of Align\u2019s pipeline and processing assets.\nRosa brings more than 20 years of industry experience to the Navigator team including various roles in operations and business development.

The dollar, already under pressure versus the yen after the Bank of Japan moved to trim its long-dated government bond purchases earlier this week, slid 0.6 percent versus a currency basket, its biggest one-day drop in a month. Spot gold was up 0.9 percent at $1,324.84 an ounce at 1211 GMT, having earlier touched its highest since Sept. 15 at $1,326.56. U.S. gold futures for February delivery were up $12.30 an ounce at $1,326.00. \"Gold is fuelled by the weak dollar after the China news came out,\" Commerzbank analyst Daniele Briesemann said. \"U.S. Treasury yields are continuing to rise - that should be a headwind for gold, but it seems to be ignored after the news late morning. It all comes down to the weak dollar.\" \"Maybe with the opening of the U.S. we could see more gains in gold due to an even weaker dollar,\" he added. The U.S. currency slumped on Wednesday after a report that China was reconsidering its stance on U.S. treasury purchases, with the greenback posting its biggest single-day drop against the Japanese yen in nearly eight months. Officials reviewing China's foreign-exchange holdings have recommended slowing or halting purchases of U.S. Treasuries, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Major government bond yields hit multi-month highs on Wednesday as investors reevaluated the likelihood of continued easy-money policies by the world's major central banks following the BoJ move. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit 2.57 percent for the first time since March. The dollar's slide helped gold shrug off the impact of rising global Treasury yields, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-interest bearing bullion. \"If the reports turn out to be true and China no longer sees Treasuries as an attractive option, the repercussions could be significant as the country is one of the biggest holders of U.S. debt,\" OANDA said in a note. \"The tightening effect of such measures would likely have an impact on how many times the Federal Reserve raises interest rates this year, which is why we've seen a corresponding drop in the dollar.\" Among other metals, palladium was down 0.2 percent at $1,098.22 an ounce, after hitting a record high on Tuesday at $1,111.40. Tightening emissions standards and a switch away from diesel cars to more palladium-heavy gasoline models has shored up demand expectations for the autocatalyst metal. Silver was up 1.2 percent at $17.15 an ounce, while platinum was 0.4 percent higher at $969.40 an ounce.

{"published":"2018-01-09T12:30:00.000+02:00","title":"Silicon Valley Reconsiders the iPhone Era It Created","text":"111 COMMENTS A tussle this week between prominent investors and Apple Inc. over iPhone use by young people comes amid a nascent re-evaluation of the smartphone\u2019s social consequences within the industry that spawned it. \nThe smartphone has fueled much of Silicon Valley\u2019s soaring profits over the past decade, enriching companies in sectors from social media to games to payments. But over the past year or so, a number of prominent industry figures have voiced concerns about the downsides of the technology\u2019s ubiquity. \nThey include Apple executives who helped create the iPhone and now express misgivings about how smartphones monopolize attention, as well as early investors and executives in Facebook Inc. who worry about social media\u2019s tendency to consume ever more user time, in part by pushing controversial content.\nThose are the kinds of concerns spotlighted in a letter to Apple on Saturday from Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, or Calstrs, which control about $2 billion of Apple shares. The letter urged the tech giant to develop new software tools that would help parents control and limit phone use more easily, and to study the impact of overuse on mental health.\nReader Reaction Reader reactions spanned from asserting that policing smartphone usage should fall to parents, while others agreed that it was up to manufacturers like Apple to take an active role in promoting healthy habits. See what readers had to say. \nOn Monday, Tony Fadell, a former senior Apple hardware executive involved in the iPhone\u2019s creation, also called on Apple to do more, saying on Twitter that adults are struggling just as much as children with smartphone overuse. Mr. Fadell, who started publicly voicing concerns about smartphones last spring, said Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google should add features to their mobile-phone operating systems to allow people to track device usage.\n\u201cJust like we need a scale for our weight we need a scale for our digital lives,\u201d Mr. Fadell said in an interview. He said he became concerned about the issue in recent years as he saw families at resorts spending time with devices rather than each other, or couples taking selfies on ski slopes rather than enjoying the views.\nApple late Monday issued a statement defending its parental controls and other protections for children who use its iPhones, saying that it started offering some of them as early as 2008. It said many of those tools can be found in the settings section of its devices.\nRelated Video On the iPhone\u2019s 10th birthday, former Apple executives Scott Forstall, Tony Fadell and Greg Christie recount the arduous process of turning Steve Jobs\u2019s vision into one of the best-selling products ever made. (Originally published June 25, 2017) Mr. Fadell\u2019s comments echoed similar remarks last year by venture capitalists affiliated with Facebook, including Chamath Palihapitiya and Roger McNamee. Mr. Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive, and Mr. McNamee, an early investor and adviser, have raised concerns about social media\u2019s tendency to encourage users through emails and notifications to open an app, causing people to live in front of their screens.\nFacebook last year acknowledged for the first time the negative consequences of time spent on its service, saying that passively consuming information on Facebook leads many users to report \u201cfeeling worse.\u201d And Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend this year working to address misuse of its products in part by \u201cmaking sure time spent on Facebook is time well spent.\u201d \n\u201cThere\u2019s a dawning realization of the effects these companies have had on us and a sense that we should no longer just go along with it,\u201d said Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates.\nThe smartphone has transformed society unlike any previous device. Its ability to substitute for the radio, television, computer and game console has made it so powerful that U.S. consumers now spend more than three hours a day on average on their mobile devices, according to research firm eMarketer. That is an increase of more than one hour from 2013.\nA handful of developers have responded to rising smartphone use by introducing apps designed to help curtail time on devices, including Checky, which tracks how often users unlock a device, and Menthal, which provides a scorecard for device usage. Alex Markowetz, who co-founded Menthal, said Apple should already offer a similar time-spent measurement on the iPhone because customers increasingly want to protect their most important assets: time and intellect.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one resource you should be willing to pay for to look after,\u201d Mr. Markowetz said.\nMr. Fadell, who helped develop the iPhone\u2019s hardware, said he has broken \u201cout sometimes in cold sweats\u201d thinking about the device\u2019s social impact. Speaking at the Computer History Museum last May, Mr. Fadell compared creating the device to Steve Martin\u2019s movie \u201cThe Jerk.\u201d In the movie, Mr. Martin portrays an inventor who creates a bridge to hold glasses on people\u2019s nose. The bridge sells well until people go cross-eyed and sue Mr. Martin\u2019s company.\n\u201cI think about that and when the kids are looking at the digital screen and different pictures are coming up and there\u2019s grandpa, me\u2014am I going to be hated by them for what we created? Or are we going to be like Alexander Graham Bell?\u201d Mr. Fadell said.\nWrite to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com"}

REUTERS\/Jason Le\/File Photo \nThe Beijing branch of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) issued a notice last week ordering LeEco CEO Jia Yueting to return to China to sort out a mounting debt pile linked to his firms and protect investors\u2019 rights. \nJia said in a statement that he had asked his brother, Jia Yuemin, to meet the regulator face-to-face last Friday to provide a report after the notice was issued. \n\u201cI am deeply sorry and blame myself for the negative impact of LeEco\u2019s debt crisis,\u201d he said in the statement that was posted on his official WeChat account on Tuesday. \n\u201cThe fundraising for Faraday Future in the United States is making significant progress and there are many tasks I need to push forward in order to ensure the production and timely delivery of the FF91,\u201d he said, referring to a luxury electric vehicle (EV) that LeEco is developing with Faraday Future. \nQuestions have been raised about the outlook for the FF91, given LeEco\u2019s spiraling cash problems as well as its decision to pull out of a joint project with British sports carmaker Aston Martin to develop RapidE electric car. \nLeEco, an entertainment, electronics and electric vehicles group, has struggled to pay its debts after rapid expansion into multiple sectors sparked a cash crunch, a plunge in the shares of a listed unit and led to multiple defaults. At its peak LeEco owed creditors 10 billion yuan ($1.54 billion). \nStruggling to support goals that included beating Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Motors ( TSLA.O ) in premium EV making, Jia has been trying to ride out the cash crunch by taking measures such cutting staff numbers and selling assets. \nJia said he had asked his wife, Gan Wei, and brother to represent him at Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp ( 300104.SZ ) in exercising shareholder rights and handling the sale of assets. Jia stepped down as CEO of the group\u2019s main listed unit in May last year. \nHe also cited a single late payment in July as being one of the key causes of LeEco\u2019s cash-flow problems, saying it led to the freezing of his assets and prompted a slew of early loan recoveries. He said \u201cfalse and malicious\u201d reports had impacted the business. \nJia was placed on an official blacklist of debt defaulters in early December, a move taken by Chinese courts to put pressure on people and entities to repay debts.

Cities from Houston to Boston have stepped up efforts to bring the homeless to shelters. \nThe cold snap complicated efforts by crews to clear snow and ice from roadways after a blizzard clobbered the East Coast on Thursday and Friday, forcing hundreds of schools to close and causing commuter rail services to suspend or reduce service. \nCold and snowy weather was blamed for at least 18 deaths in the past few days, including four in North Carolina traffic accidents and three in Texas. \nKillington, the famous Vermont ski resort, closed on Saturday even though snow conditions were excellent, saying wind chill on the slopes was at least minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 46 degrees Celsius). \n\u201cIt\u2019s just too cold to put folks out there,\u201d the resort said on its website. \nThe brutal cold in parts of the East Coast and Midwest showed no sign of abating this weekend, but a thaw should begin on Monday, said meteorologist Bob Oravec of the National Weather Service\u2019s Maryland-based Weather Prediction Center. Before then, conditions will probably worsen. A woman bundles up against the cold temperature as she walks in Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S., January 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Amr Alfiky \n\u201cSunday morning is going to be the coldest morning\u201d in the weeklong stretch of frigid weather, he said. \nIn many parts of the eastern United States, residents shivered in temperatures of below 0F (minus 18C), Oravec said. Slideshow (4 Images) \nAmong the coldest places in the country on Saturday were the small Minnesota towns of Cotton and Embarrass, where the mercury plummeted to minus 39F (minus 39C), Oravec said. But that fell short of a record low for those hamlets in the northeastern corner of the state, where sub-zero temperatures are not unusual in January. \nNot so with New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, where a measuring station recorded a record low for this date at 8F (minus 13C), Oravec said. \nThe airport had closed from Thursday to Friday morning because of whiteout conditions from heavy snow. Some passengers endured more delays on Saturday after the wing of a China Southern plane clipped the tail of a Kuwait Airlines jet on the tarmac. \nAfter shutting down on Tuesday, Charleston International Airport in South Carolina remained closed on Saturday, with runaways still inactive after 5 inches (12.7 cm) of snow. \nThe East Coast\u2019s first snowstorm of 2018 featured gusts of more than 70 miles per hour (113 km per hour), dumping 22 inches (56 cm) of snow in parts of Maine and 17 inches (43 cm) in parts of Massachusetts before ending on Friday, the National Weather Service said. \nThe storm was powered by a rapid drop in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters called a bombogenesis, or a \u201cbomb cyclone.\u201d Additional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles, Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee and Harriet McLeod in Charleston, South Carolina; Editing by Frank McGurty and Lisa Von Ahn"}

Wortman has joined the Firm as a Partner in the Consumer Finance Litigation group in the New York office. At Blank Rome, Mr. Wortman will serve as a litigator and counselor to clients facing scrutiny under consumer financial protection statutes and regulations at both the federal and state level, including individual and class action defense, regulatory proceedings, and administrative investigations. He joins Blank Rome from Warshaw Burstein LLP.\n\u201cWe are very excited to welcome Scott to Blank Rome,\u201d said Alan J. Hoffman , the Firm\u2019s Chairman and Managing Partner. \u201cScott\u2019s experience covers a broad spectrum of federal matters related to consumer finance litigation and regulation, bringing valuable perspective to the Firm, particularly in this era of heightened enforcement. Additionally, Scott recognizes the implications of various state regulations placed on consumer financial services companies, and can advise them on everything from licensing rules to requirements set by state attorneys general, as well as codes, structures, and statutes regulating the lending industry.\u201d\nMr. Wortman\u2019s experience includes litigating and resolving numerous matters as related to the Truth in Lending Act, Telephone Consumer Protection Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, related consumer torts, associated state consumer protection laws, and administrative and regulatory actions.\n\u201cBlank Rome\u2019s Consumer Financial Services Industry Team plays an integral role in the regulatory, compliance, litigation, bankruptcy, and government enforcement matters facing our clients,\u201d said Wayne Streibich , Chair of Blank Rome\u2019s Consumer Financial Services Industry Team and Consumer Finance Litigation group. \u201cScott\u2019s understanding of where current litigation trends and the evolving regulatory structure are taking the consumer financial services market, coupled with his experience in class action, government enforcement, and individual actions, will further enhance and differentiate Blank Rome\u2019s practice in the consumer lending and servicing sector. Scott\u2019s skill set will assist Blank Rome in continuing to provide forward-looking business advantages for our clients.\u201d\nIn addition to providing litigation counsel to his clients, Mr. Wortman helps financial services firms comply with privacy and data security laws, and assists with due diligence for financial services transactions. For example, on the technology side, law firms are now considered by many federal and state regulators to be vendors. The New York State Department of Financial Services (\u201cDFS\u201d) was the first agency to require that vendors of DFS-licensed financial services companies also comply with the cybersecurity rules set for those organizations. Mr. Wortman helps organizations, like law firms, come into compliance with those rules and regulations.\n\u201cIt is truly an honor to join Blank Rome\u2019s Consumer Finance Litigation practice group,\u201d said Mr. Wortman. \u201cBlank Rome has a view for the future and an interest in technology, particularly as it relates to emerging industries like cryptocurrency and FinTech, which is a perfect match for my practice. Furthermore, the Firm\u2019s national presence is extremely important to my clients, many of whom are managing consumer finance regulations across the country. I look forward to starting the New Year at Blank Rome and working with all of my new colleagues across the Firm\u2019s practices to strengthen relationships with our clients, and helping them create compliance solutions for changing regulatory frameworks.\u201d\nAligned with Blank Rome\u2019s significant commitment to pro bono and community investment, Mr. Wortman draws on his past experience as the executive director of the Center for Behavior Services, of which he now serves as vice chairman of the board of directors. In this role, Mr. Wortman\u2019s work is dedicated to providing housing relief for individuals who were once incarcerated and are completing work release programs. Through Blank Rome\u2019s pro bono program, Mr. Wortman will continue to make actionable impact in support of marginalized individuals in need of housing.\nMr. Wortman earned his J.D. from the New York Law School, and his B.A. from Queens College, City University of New York.\nAbout Blank Rome LLP\nFounded in 1946, Blank Rome is an Am Law 100 firm with 13 offices and over 600 attorneys throughout the United States and in Shanghai who represent businesses and organizations ranging from Fortune 500 companies to start-up entities around the globe.

Nobody has been convicted for her murder. Titiev continued her work, despite colleagues saying he received threats to desist. \nThe interior ministry said police had found what looked like 180 grams of cannabis in Titiev\u2019s car after stopping him to check his documents. The substance has been sent for checks, it said. \nThe illegal possession of such a quantity of cannabis is punishable with a jail term of between three and 10 years and a fine. Titiev says the drugs were planted. \nKatya Sokirianskaia, director at the Conflict Analysis and Prevention Centre and someone with extensive experience working in the region, told Reuters Titiev\u2019s detention looked like an attempt to squeeze Memorial and \u201call remaining seeds of activism\u201d out of Chechnya. U.S. SANCTIONS \nCritics have accused the Kremlin of turning a blind eye to rights abuses in Chechnya saying it values stability above the rule of law. Chechnya fought two wars against Russia after the 1991 Soviet collapse, but now, in return for generous subsidies and a wide degree of autonomy, pledges loyalty to Moscow. \nA Kremlin spokesman on Wednesday referred a question about Titiev\u2019s case to the police, saying specific allegations against the activist had been made. \nSokirianskaia said Chechen officials had stepped up their rhetoric against rights defenders after the United States in December sanctioned Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed head of Chechnya, for alleged rights abuses. \nKadyrov was removed from the Facebook and Instagram social networks as a result, platforms he used assiduously for public relations purposes. \n\u201cThe Chechen authorities directly blamed human rights defenders for this,\u201d said Sokirianskaia. \nKadyrov, who calls himself a foot soldier of President Vladimir Putin, denies any abuses, casting his critics as being motivated by foreign grants and a desire to weaken Russia. \nTanya Lokshina, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, said framing people for drug crimes had \u201dbecome an increasingly frequent tactic used by Chechnya\u2019s authorities\u201c to punish and discredit their critics.\u201d \nNils Muiznieks, the Council of Europe\u2019s commissioner for human rights, called on Russia to free Titiev immediately, saying he\u2019d been detained \u201cunder dubious charges that lack credibility.\u201d Editing by Richard Balmforth"}

But it has maintained its $67 ceiling of resistance for months \u2014 a level Moreno doesn't think will hold for much longer.\nMoreno pointed to the chart's stochastic oscillator, a tool that measures whether a stock is overbought or oversold.\n\"The oscillator just recently ... crossed above the center line. When it does that, Moreno says that's a sign that the stock is ready to gallop \u2014 important since it's only a buck away from the ceiling of resistance,\" Cramer said. \"This four-month period of consolidation, which has been torture, is like a coiled spring, he says, ready to propel the stock higher.\"\nMoreno had a similar outlook for Electronic Arts, which produces Battlefield, The Sims and a host of licensed sports games including FIFA.\n\nLike Activision, Electronic Arts' stock had been consolidating for months before forming a cup-and-handle pattern in December under its $110 ceiling of resistance.\nBut even though the stock has trumped its ceiling, closing Wednesday at $112.25, its trajectory remains murky. While its relative strength index, a key momentum indicator, has been trending higher, its accumulation\/distribution line, a tool that measures money flow, has stayed flat.\n\"This is going to need to pick up before Moreno will really believe that EA is ready to run, but once it does, he thinks the stock could have a ton of upside,\" Cramer said.\nSo as the gaming industry continues its seemingly unstoppable uptrend in 2018, Cramer and Moreno expect the rising tide to lift these boats.\n\"The video game space remains one of the hottest secular growth groups around, and I think these stocks have more room to run in 2018, including Take-Two Interactive,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"But the charts ... suggest that Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard could end up giving you better performance this year as they start to play catch-up to this tremendous out-performer run by Strauss Zelnick .\"\nWATCH: Cramer's charts bullish for video game names show chapters Cramer's charts show video game stocks like Take-Two have more room to run      17 Hours Ago | 10:46 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

{"published":"2018-01-08T22:15:00.000+02:00","title":"For stocks to continue hitting new highs, they need to pull back first","text":"What a start to the year.\n\nThe stock market posted one of its best weeks in over a year and all the major averages hit records.\n\nHowever, let's be honest: those who are looking for this rally to continue nicely through the rest of the first quarter should be hoping for a pullback right here.\n\nThat's right \u2014 a pullback at this juncture would help the market digest its recent gains and work off stocks' overbought condition, which will actually give it a better chance of rallying further in the future. \n\nAfter all, that's exactly what we're looking for. The stock market has become very, very overbought; the S&P 500 's relative strength index has now moved above 85, and sentiment has become very, very bullish. So bullish, in fact, that it has now reached levels that are usually followed by short-term pullbacks. \n\nNot only have we heard many bullish comments from pundits and billionaires alike, but the latest Daily Sentiment Index data show futures traders have become wildly bullish on the stock market.\n\nSomething else to chew on here is what truly drove last week's impressive price action. The credit seems to be going to the expected impact of tax cuts and the synchronized global expansion we are seeing. That's great, and probably true. But did things really improve that much last week?\n\nYes, we got some better-than-expected data last week (at least until the employment report on Friday) both domestically and overseas. Still, they were not shockingly high numbers, and we did not see significant moves in any other market.\n\nInstead, consider this theory: the data were simply good enough to help the stock market rally a bit; but then the algorithms kicked in and took the market higher, which caused so-called performance fear to kick in for institutional investors who don't want to fall behind at the very start of the year. That, in turn, took the market higher and in turn pushed algorithms to buy more, and these two issues kept feeding on one another.\n\nOf course, this does not mean the market cannot go much higher over time; it could even go higher within a couple of weeks. We simply already knew the economy was growing on a synchronized basis, and the tax bill was passed before the holidays. Thus, we question whether last week's rally is something that will see a lot of upside follow-through in the near term.\n\nUltimately, our call in the very short term is the expectation of a stock market pullback this week. Once these broad indexes work off their overbought conditions, we'll want to see more solid earnings and how exactly companies will implement tax breaks. Then, we'll have a better idea of whether today's valuations are indeed justified. \n\nUntil we hear something about this global synchronized growth and the implications from the tax bill that are not already known, a pullback here would be healthy, and normal.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

He fears irrelevance and can\u2019t stand not seeing his name in the headlines,\u201d Elliott said. \n\u201cHe should grow up, and realise that this issue is more important than any one person. It is about implementing the democratically expressed wishes of the British people in a serious and sensible way.\u201d \nElliott praised May for her conduct of the negotiations which are now turning to the details of how Britain will trade with the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc after Brexit. \n\u201cTheresa May and her government are doing a good job in the negotiations and we should give them our full support,\u201d he said. \u201cBickering and carping from the sidelines undermines the national interest at this important juncture in the talks.\u201d \nOn Thursday, a ComRes poll for the Daily Mirror newspaper of 1,049 adults showed that although more people think there should not be a second referendum (51 to 43 percent), if there were to be a re-run, voters say they would opt to stay in the EU by 55 to 45 percent.

Those options let him purchase the shares at prices between $12.985 and $26.795, significantly lower than where Intel was trading at the time.\nHe sold another 245,743 shares that he already owned at a weighted average of $44.55. That brought down the total number of shares he owns to 250,000 \u2014 which is the minimum number of shares that the CEO of Intel is required to own, according to a Motley Fool report. Krzanich sold all of those shares for a little over $39 million, apparently netting about $25 million.\nThe filing showed that the sales were part of a 10b5-1 plan, which was created on Oct. 30, just a month before Krzanich sold the shares. The 10b5-1 is a trading plan that company executives set up to sell stocks they own at a pre-determined time so that they are not accused of insider trading.\nMultiple outlets, however, have reported that Intel and other chip makers were notified of the security vulnerabilities in June. \nSecurity researchers released documentation this week of critical vulnerabilities in modern processors used on almost every computer around the world. The hardware bugs \u2014 known as Meltdown and Spectre could allow programs to steal data including \"passwords stored in a password manager or browser, your personal photos, emails, instant messages and even business-critical documents.\"\nWhile Meltdown is specific to Intel processors, and can be patched, Spectre affects Intel, AMD and ARM processors \u2014 meaning almost every device that uses a chip \u2014 and is harder to fix.

Somebody was doing some updates on a Linux kernel and they improperly posted that this was due to this flaw,\" Krzanich said. \"That's why we're responding to it today.\"\n\u2014 CNBC's Matt Rosoff and Anita Balakrishnan contributed to this report."}

It is never fun to go through those experiences, of course, but they are always valuable.\u201d \nThe pair, which last year missed the world podium for the first time since 2012, cannot pinpoint the moment when things started to sour. Neither do they attribute their troubles to Radford skating with a herniated disc at the worlds, a competition he said was \u201ccompletely exhausting and scary.\u201d \n\u201cI have never felt so much fear going into a competition,\u201d Radford, 32, said. \n\u201cWhen I look back on that moment, it really does seem to have happened for a reason. Those changes were made because of what happened at the worlds. Time will tell.\u201d STAYING FRESH \nDuhamel and Radford, who won silver in the inaugural team event in Sochi, used the momentum of the Olympic season to win bronze at the 2014 world championships. \nThey were unstoppable after that. \nBut the pair\u2019s post-Sochi meteoric success ultimately took its toll.

Mandatory Credit: Sergei Belski-USA TODAY Sports\/File Photo \nDuhamel and Radford were finding it difficult to remain original when they were the ones setting the standards. \n\u201cIn an artistic sport like figure skating, the most difficult thing to do is stay fresh,\u201d Radford said. \nIn recent years the pair have pushed the boundaries of athleticism with the throw quad Salchow. \nIn this element of their free programme, Radford tosses Duhamel, who spins four times in the air before landing backwards on one foot. \nThe treacherous jump, if well-executed, could help the pair move closer to Olympic gold. \n\u201cWe know what our potential is, if we skate two clean programs we can win that gold medal,\u201d Radford said. \n\u201cBut at this point in our careers, leading into the Olympics, it\u2019s like we just want to go out there and have a great experience and a good skate.\u201d \nThe pair won the Skate Canada grand prix event in October with 222.22 points after having finished second in the short programme behind Aliona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany. \nThe pair finished third at the Skate America grand prix event, with Duhamel falling on the side-by-side jump and putting her hand down on the throw quad Salchow. \nThey also came in third at the Grand Prix Final in Japan in December, with Duhamel falling on the throw quadruple Salchow. \n\u201cWe have a lot of things to improve from this competition as we go their ability forward to the Olympics,\u201d Duhamel told reporters. \u201cI think the most important for us will be to do a clean short programme at the Olympics.\u201d \nAlthough Duhamel and Radford recognise their podium potential, their recent trials have made observers question their ability to shine at their last Games. \n\u201cI think a lot of people will write us off and we\u2019re fine with that,\u201d Duhamel said. \u201cLet everyone else have the pressure and we can show up, do our jobs and hopefully be back on top.\u201d Reporting by Steve Keating; Additional reporting by Elaine Lies in Nagoya; Writing by Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty"}

{"published":"2017-12-30T18:38:00.000+02:00","title":"New California laws cover immigration, marijuana, education","text":"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California state lawmakers in 2017 passed nearly 900 bills that Gov. Jerry Brown then signed into law. Most of them take effect Monday. The new laws cover topics ranging from the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, to the state's new recreational cannabis market, to the price of a college education.\nHere are some of the laws taking effect with the new year:\nIMMIGRATION\nPolice will no longer be able to ask people about their immigration status or participate in federal immigration enforcement actions under a law making California a sanctuary state. The law also allows jail officials to transfer inmates to federal immigration authorities only if they have been convicted of certain crimes.\nIt was among numerous bills designed to thwart the policies of President Donald Trump's administration.\nAlso starting Monday, immigration officials will need a warrant to access workplaces or employee records and landlords will be barred from disclosing tenants' citizenship. Another new law will prohibit university officials from cooperating with immigration officers.\nAn additional bill will bar law enforcement officials from detaining a crime victim or witness only because of an actual or suspected immigration violation, or turning them over to immigration authorities without a warrant.\nCANNABIS\nSales of recreational marijuana will be legal under a 2016 voter initiative that created the nation's biggest legal drug market.\nBut it will be illegal to take and drive a under bill taking effect Jan. 1 that outlaws smoking and ingesting marijuana, just as it's already unlawful for drivers or passengers to drink alcohol while driving. A separate law that took effect in June bars the possession of open containers of cannabis while driving.\nON THE JOB\nThe state minimum wage will increase to $10.50 per hour for businesses with 25 or fewer employees and to $11 per hour for those with 26 or more employees.\nSmall businesses with between 20 and 49 people will have to offer 12 weeks of unpaid maternity and paternity leave to employees.\nEmployers can't ask job applicants about their past salaries, a measure designed to narrow the pay gap between men and women.\nCalifornia will become the 10th state to require both public- and private-sector employers of five or more employees to delay background checks and inquiries about job applicants' conviction records until they have made a conditional job offer, a measure known as \"ban the box.\"\nThose arrested but not convicted of a crime may ask a judge to seal their records, a move advocates say will help them get hired.\nHEALTH-RELATED\nPharmaceutical companies must give advance notice before big price increases, although a drugmakers' trade group is suing to block the measure.\nIt will be illegal to deny admission to long-term care facilities based on gender identity or sexual orientation or to repeatedly fail to use a resident's preferred name or pronoun.\nCLIMATE CHANGE\nOld-fashioned incandescent light bulbs will start disappearing from shelves because they can no longer meet energy efficiency standards under a 2007 federal law. That leaves compact fluorescent lights or light-emitting diode bulbs under the regulations, which take effect nationwide in 2020. The federal law let California impose the higher standards two years early. Although the industry is fighting the change in court, a federal judge is letting the restriction take effect while the case continues.\nEDUCATION\nThe first year of community college may be free for full-time, in-state students under a law that waives the $46 per unit fee for one academic year for first-time students. Lawmakers still must provide the money in the next budget. California follows Tennessee in creating the program, though California previously offered free tuition until 1984.\nPublic schools must test yearly for lead in their water supplies under a law passed in response to problems in San Ysidro schools.\nStudents in grades 7-12 must be taught about sexual abuse and human trafficking prevention.\nSchools will be prohibited from \"lunch shaming,\" or publicly denying lunch to students or providing a snack instead because their parents haven't paid meal fees.\nPublic schools serving low-income students in grades 6 to 12 must provide free tampons and menstrual products in half of restrooms.\nFIREARMS\nAmmunition purchased in another state, online or through a catalog can't be brought into California except through a licensed ammunition dealer under Proposition 63, approved by voters in 2016. The initiative also sets a new process and deadlines for gun owners to give up their weapons if they are convicted of a felony or certain violent misdemeanors.\nSuperintendents can no longer allow people with permits to carry concealed guns on school grounds under a separate new law. Only about five school districts previously had such policies.\nCRIMINAL JUSTICE\nRepeat drug offenders will no longer automatically get an additional three years added to their sentences.\nCriminals who videotape or stream their crimes on social media could face longer sentences under a law that allows judges to consider the recordings as aggravating factors in sentences for certain violent crimes.\nOfficials must consider paroling inmates who are age 60 or older and have served at least 25 years under a law that largely mirrors a 2014 federal court order designed to help reduce prison overcrowding.\nIntentionally transmitting the AIDS-causing virus HIV is being reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor, the same punishment as transmitting other communicable diseases.\nJUVENILE OFFENDERS\nCalifornia inmates serving life sentences for crimes they committed as juveniles will get the chance to leave prison after 25 years, making state law conform to recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions.\nAnother bill expands California's youthful parole program to age 25. State law already required that inmates who were under 23 when they committed their crimes be considered for parole after serving at least 15 years.\nFamilies of youths in the juvenile justice system won't be charged fees that advocates say many can't afford to pay under a separate law. Another will require offenders age 15 or younger to consult with attorneys before waiving their rights.\nOne more bill will require that records be sealed for dismissed juvenile court petitions or after a juvenile completes a diversion program, while another will let a judge seal juvenile records even for serious or violent offenses after the offender has completed the sentence."}

While the developers agree that investment assets may require SEC oversight, they have tended to make the case for why utility tokens do not. \nBut the commentary piece makes it clear the SEC isn't making much distinction, and that securities law applies to at least some cryptocurrencies. \n\"The SEC will vigorously pursue those who seek to evade the registration, disclosure and antifraud requirements of our securities laws,\" the piece said. \"In addition, the SEC is monitoring the cryptocurrency-related activities of the market participants it regulates, including broker-dealers, investment advisers and trading platforms.\" \nThe SEC has become tougher on initial coin offerings. In July, the commission used a case study to indicate that securities law may apply to digital coin offerings and issued an investor warning. In September, the SEC launched a cyber unit to increase enforcement on cyber-based threats to retail investors, including ICO fraud. The commission has also temporarily suspended trading in some tiny stocks due to questions about the companies' claims around initial coin offerings or other token-related announcements. \nBut increased SEC oversight doesn't necessarily spell doom for ICOs, which are banned completely in China. Several leaders in the digital currency world expect increased regulation on cryptocurrencies and related business models will help the industry to mature. \n\"The willingness to pursue the commercialization of innovation is one of America's great strengths,\" the commission chairmen said, noting that \"some of the dot-com survivors are among the world's leading companies today.\" \n\"This longstanding, uniquely American characteristic is the envy of the world. Our regulatory efforts should embrace it.\" "}

(Reuters) - The judge overseeing the bankruptcy of Takata Corp\u2019s ( TKTDQ.PK ) U.S. unit on Wednesday cleared the way for the company\u2019s creditors to vote on its Chapter 11 plan, which critics say limits the legal rights of those injured by its deadly airbags. \nTakata and its U.S. entity TK Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy in June after more than 100 million of its airbags were recalled because they could inflate with too much force and spray metal fragments. \nThe airbags have been linked to at least 180 injuries and 18 deaths, including one in Louisiana that was identified last month. \nDuring Wednesday\u2019s hearing, the judge reviewed the adequacy of TK Holdings\u2019 disclosures, which attempt to summarize and translate the dense legalese of the company\u2019s proposed reorganization plan. \nCritics have said the plan favors automakers over car owners. They used the hearing to test arguments that could be raised again at a Feb. 13 confirmation hearing, when U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon in Wilmington, Delaware, will decide if the plan is fair and meets other requirements. \nShannon raised the possibility on Wednesday that he might not approve a proposal contained in the reorganization plan to establish a fund to compensate those with personal injury claims caused by airbags in vehicles made by Honda Motor Co Ltd ( 7267.T ). \nThe trust would pay compensation based on the injury, ranging from $10,000 for bruising to $5 million for death or loss of eyesight, according to court documents. \nCar owners would be barred from suing Honda and other car makers could opt to join the trust arrangement. \nSander Esserman, a lawyer representing car owners seeking to recover costs related to the recall, criticized the trust proposal because it limited the rights of consumers by barring punitive damages and paying compensation in installments. \nHonda\u2019s attorney, Jessica Boelter of Sidley Austin, said the company was owed $9.4 billion from the recall, which she said was the biggest claim of any automaker. \nTakata plans to sell its viable operations to Key Safety Systems, an affiliate of China\u2019s Ningo Joyson Electric Corp ( 600699.SS ), for $1.6 billion. The proceeds will fund restitution claims for automakers and help pay personal injury and wrongful death claims. \nReporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Del.; Editing by Matthew Lewis\n "}

The speculation started with the Bank of Japan, but all central banks are expected to take a tighter stance towards monetary policy. The U.S. 10-year yield rose to 2.55 percent, the highest since March. 6 Hours Ago | 06:37 \nThe bond market is getting a wake-up call from global central banks that the post-financial crisis era of easy money and super low interest rates is coming to an end. \nIn what was a sizzling move for the Treasury market, the 10-year yield zipped higher Tuesday amid talk that the Bank of Japan could finally be ready to wind down its easy policies. The 10-year yield broke above the key 2.50 percent level and was trading as high as 2.55 percent, the highest since March. \nThe 10-year is key since it is a benchmark that mortgages and many other consumer and business loans are based on. \nStrategists said as the market fixated on the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank was also a focus. The ECB cut its bond buying in half as of last week, and there is increasing speculation it could cut back altogether before the end of the year. Both central banks are well behind the Fed which has already raised interest rates five times and has been unwinding its balance sheet. \nWhile still down the road, moves to limit easing would put both of those central banks closer to the time when they begin to adjust interest rates to more normal levels. The Bank of Japan Tuesday bought fewer longer duration bonds than it has been purchasing, sparking the speculation its program is coming to an end. However, strategists said the changes could be more technical than an indication the central bank is about to change course. \n\"I have argued the Bank of Japan and ECB set long end interest rates in this county as much as the Fed does. Our long end interest rates can move higher. I think the 10-year Treasury is going to hit significantly higher interest rates than they are now,\" said Rick Rieder, global chief investment officer, fixed income at BlackRock. \"We think the 10-year this year is going to 3 percent. I still hold to that.\" \nThe 10-year yield has run up quickly and was trading at 2.44 percent at the beginning of the year. \n\"For what has been a very low volatility market, this is a big day,\" said Rieder. The 10-year was at 2.54 percent in late trading. \nThe U.S. 10-year yield has been in a flattening trend \u2014moving closer to the 2-year yield, which has been rising on the prospect of Fed interest rate hikes. But the 10-year has also been held down because of low interest rates in other part of the world that make U.S. yields look more attractive. Yields move opposite price. \n\"I think it started with Japan. Obviously, they're not making any huge shifts in their monetary policy, but this is a movement in that direction of removing some of the accommodation. It's taken global central banks many years to build this up. It's not going to be removed very quickly. Nonethess, it's going to put upward pressure on rates,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management. \nRieder said the market move also comes as inflation appears to be picking up and more Treasury and global sovereign debt is coming to market. Meanwhile, those major central bank bond purchases by the Fed and others are slowing down. \n\"There's at least $1 trillion reduction between the Fed and the ECB this year. That's significant,\" said Peter Boocvkar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. \nMark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said there were other factors that impacted yields Tuesday. \"We also had China come out and suggest they're going to stop relying on a counter cyclical factor in their fixing of the yuan. On net, that means China needs to rely less on intervention in order to support the yuan and that would mean on net, less U.S. dollars and less U.S. dollar investment,\" like Treasurys, said Cabana. \nCabana said Tuesday's move was significant but whether it indicates a turn in the market is yet to be seen. \"It's too soon to tell. The fact we have broken above 2.50 clearly is certainly something we''ve not done for almost a year and it very well may be leading to higher overall levels of rates,\" he said. \nCabana said Fed officials may also have contributed to the market move with talk of moving to a policy of price level targeting rather than using a target for inflation. The difference would be the target price levels would be set for a specific period of time. Cabana said the result could be fewer near term rate increases as inflation builds up.

The drop has not been previously reported. \nThe Trump administration has taken a series of measures to more closely scrutinize legal immigration. These steps have been overshadowed by Trump\u2019s more public efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, such as his calls for a wall along the Mexican border and more arrests of people living in the country illegally. \nLately though, Trump has increasingly been taking aim at chain migration, saying it allows a single immigrant \u201cto bring in dozens of increasingly distant relations,\u201d with \u201cno real selection criteria.\u201d He said a Bangladeshi man who set off a homemade pipe bomb in a crowded New York City commuter hub in December was a prime example of the dangers of the system. \nImmigration advocates counter that no one automatically qualifies for a visa because a relative is already in the United States. All immigrants undergo security vetting and can face years-long waits before they are given a green light. \nThe intensified focus on chain migration has been accompanied by an overall slowdown in adjudications of family-based visas, known as I-130s, the Reuters review shows. \nThe number of approvals dropped by nearly a quarter in the first nine months of 2017 to around 406,000 compared to the same period a year earlier when approvals were more than 530,000, despite a similar number of applications during both periods, USCIS data showed. \nThe drop was even starker when looking only at I-130s approved for relatives who were not immediate family members. Those fell by 70 percent in the same period, from more than 108,000 in the first nine months of 2016 to 32,500 in the same period in 2017. The entire 2017 fiscal year had the lowest number of approvals for extended family visas since 2000. \nUSCIS said that since there are a limited number of visas for this category, it prioritizes processing visas that are more immediately available. The agency also said there are normal year-to-year fluctuations in the number of visas that are filed and decided. \nAt the core of the administration\u2019s long-term policy goal is a belief that immigration should be merit-based. \n\u201cThose people are just coming in based on connection to a family member,\u201d the new director of USCIS, L. Francis Cissna said in a telephone interview, referring to chain migrants. \u201cThat lack of selectivity; it takes us away from where we want to go as a country.\u201d \nCissna said no specific policy guidance has been put in place at USCIS to change the way family-based visas are issued. He also said there were no plans to restrict visas for immediate family members and pointed out that approvals of visas and citizenship applications overall are still high. \nHe has said, however, that his agency is looking closely at all visa categories to root out fraud. USCIS said separately that closer scrutiny could lead to longer processing times.

[nL2N1LY0F5] \nUSCIS has also put in place new interview requirements for U.S. citizens seeking to bring over their fianc\u00e9s. In the first nine months of 2017, approvals of fianc\u00e9 visas dropped by 35 percent over the same period a year earlier, the Reuters data review found. \n\n\u2018ONTO THE MAIN STAGE\u2019 \nImmigration supporters said any efforts by the administration to restrict the entry of family members of migrants was shortsighted. They \u201cbring drive and entrepreneurial spirit to the United States,\u201d said Steve Yale-Loehr, an immigration law expert at Cornell University. FILE PHOTO: A man exits the transit area after clearing immigration and customs on arrival at Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Virginia, U.S., September 24, 2017. REUTERS\/James Lawler Duggan\/File Photo \nChain migration has long been a target of groups that favor more restrictions on legal immigration. The idea, supported by organizations like NumbersUSA, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), failed to gain much traction at the highest levels of power in Washington before Trump took office. \n\u201cWe have been talking about this for a long time but we were kind of out there in the wilderness\u201d said Ira Mehlman from FAIR. \u201cIt was never at this level of discussion before.\u201d \nNow supporters of the ideas of restricting chain migration and tightening standards for legal immigration occupy key positions in the administration. They include Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who remains vocal on the issue, and his long-time aide Stephen Miller, who is now one of Trump\u2019s closest policy advisers. \nThe current USCIS ombudsman Julie Kirchner was previously the executive director of FAIR. \nThe White House and the Department of Justice did not respond to questions about the influence of the groups, which critics say are anti-immigrant, on administration policy. \nJessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at CIS, said she and her colleagues \u201care in fairly regular contact with various administration officials as they solicit suggestions and ideas to improve policies.\u201d She said she had also spoken to officials in the Obama administration, but only occasionally. \nEarlier this month NumbersUSA launched a national advertising campaign against chain migration. A day later the White House posted a presentation on the same subject making many of the same points. \nNumbersUSA director Roy Beck said any similarity in the points was just a coincidence. Still, he is thrilled that his group\u2019s ideas on restricting legal immigration have been \u201ccatapulted onto the main stage in an unprecedented way,\u201d he said in an interview. \nIn April, Trump signed an executive order directing agencies to draft new rules and guidance for the legal immigration system. In August, the White House backed the RAISE Act, proposed legislation sponsored by two Republican lawmakers, that aimed to cut legal immigration by 50 percent over 10 years. \nFor a graphic on chain migration, click tmsnrt.rs\/2CaWNJb Reporting by Mica Rosenberg in New York; Additional reporting by Yeganeh Torbati in Washington; Editing by Sue Horton and Ross Colvin"}

Volkswagen, which has been working with Aurora for the past six months, aims to launch commercial fleets of self-driving electric vehicles in two to five cities beginning in 2021, VW Group\u2019s chief digital officer Johann Jungwirth told Fortune . These \u201cmobility-as-a-service\u201d fleets \u2014 a system VW Group is currently developing \u2014 will initially include smaller self-driving vehicles (like the SEDRIC pod unveiled in 2017) that people can hail as well as larger vans. Jungwirth says Aurora\u2019s self-driving tech could be applied to other vehicle platforms as well, including autonomous trucks, delivery vans, even roving mailbox stations. \nVW hasn\u2019t identified these initial launch cities, but Jungwirth said some will be in the U.S. \n\u201cFor me, this is a very big deal; it\u2019s a potential partnership of the century, said Jungwirth, who noted the company\u2019s ultimate goal is for anyone in the world to be able access self-driving vehicles and get to where they need to go with \u201cpush of a button.\u201d \nVW Group is betting Aurora, which provides the package of software, hardware, and data services that make up the self-driving system, will get it there faster. \nAurora will also work with Hyundai to bring Level 4 self-driving vehicles to market by 2021. Under that partnership, Aurora\u2019s tech will be integrated into Hyundai models, starting with the automaker\u2019s new-generation hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle. Testing is expected to begin this year. \nBoth automakers want to commercialize self-driving vehicles globally. \nThe separate partnerships announced Thursday are a milestone for Aurora\u2019s founders, Sterling Anderson, Drew Bagnell, and Chris Urmson, all early pioneers of the technology who led autonomous vehicles programs at Google (goog) , Tesla (tsla) , and Uber (uber) . Urmson led the Google self-driving program until 2016, Anderson was the former head of Tesla\u2019s semi autonomous Autopilot program, and Bagnell helped launch Uber\u2019s efforts in autonomy. \nWhile Volkswagen and Hyundai \u2014 with their millions of branded vehicles globally \u2014 are well-known, Aurora is far from a household name. The company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., and Pittsburgh, has operated largely in secret since it launched last January. \nAurora provides the \u201cfull-stack solution\u201d for self-driving vehicles. This means the company will work with Volkswagen and Hyundai, and possibly other automakers in the future, to design and develop the right package of sensors, software, and data services needed to deploy fully autonomous vehicles. Aurora is focused on Level 4 autonomous systems, and eventually Level 5. Level 4 is a designation by SAE International that means the car takes over all of the driving in certain conditions. In Level 5 autonomy, a vehicle is driverless in any and all circumstances and environments. \nAurora might be tiny by every measure, but these comparative giants are counting on the company to help bring commercial self-driving vehicles to world faster. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been quite thrilling,\u201d said Urmson, who is CEO of Aurora. In many ways, Urmson is in a similar role as when he led Google\u2019s self-driving project, which spun out to become its own business called Waymo in 2016. \n\u201cBut it\u2019s quite different when it\u2019s, you know, \u2018our company;\u2019 we were able to set the mission independently and attract the talent,\u201d Urmson said. \u201cAnd the fact that two of the world\u2019s largest auto manufacturers share that vision with us and are willing to place a bet on us to partner with them to move this technology forward is humbling and also kind of exciting.\u201d \nVolkswagen will deploy autonomous test vehicles developed with Aurora on public roads in 2018. Aurora has been working to integrate its self-driving system into VW\u2019s vehicle platforms. VW vehicles are already on the road, said Anderson, who is chief product officer. However, Aurora is working on a custom vehicle with Volkswagen that is not quite ready yet, Anderson said, adding those vehicles will also be on the road testing. \nThe number of test vehicles will grow to \u201ctriple digits\u201d in 2019, and \u201cfour digits\u201d in 2020, before going into production in 2021, Jungwirth said. Ultimately, the self-driving system could be integrated across VW Group\u2019s many brands include Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, Bentley, Skoda and Porsche. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

Intel and ARM insisted that the issue was not a design flaw, but it will require users to download a patch and update their operating system to fix. \n\u201cPhones, PCs, everything are going to have some impact, but it\u2019ll vary from product to product,\u201d Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in an interview with CNBC Wednesday afternoon. \nResearchers with Alphabet Inc\u2019s ( GOOGL.O ) Google Project Zero, in conjunction with academic and industry researchers from several countries, discovered two flaws. \nThe first, called Meltdown, affects Intel chips and lets hackers bypass the hardware barrier between applications run by users and the computer\u2019s memory, potentially letting hackers read a computer\u2019s memory and steal passwords. The second, called Spectre, affects chips from Intel, AMD and ARM and lets hackers potentially trick otherwise error-free applications into giving up secret information. \nThe researchers said Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) and Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) had patches ready for users for desktop computers affected by Meltdown. Microsoft declined to comment and Apple did not immediately return requests for comment. \nDaniel Gruss, one of the researchers at Graz University of Technology who discovered Meltdown, called it \u201cprobably one of the worst CPU bugs ever found\u201d in an interview with Reuters. \nGruss said Meltdown was the more serious problem in the short term but could be decisively stopped with software patches. Spectre, the broader bug that applies to nearly all computing devices, is harder for hackers to take advantage of but less easily patched and will be a bigger problem in the long term, he said. \nSpeaking on CNBC, Intel\u2019s Krzanich said Google researchers told Intel of the flaws \u201ca while ago\u201d and that Intel had been testing fixes that device makers who use its chips will push out next week. Before the problems became public, Google on its blog said Intel and others planned to disclose the issues on Jan. 9. Google said it informed the affected companies about the \u201cSpectre\u201d flaw on June 1, 2017 and reported the \u201cMeltdown\u201d flaw after the first flaw but before July 28, 2017. \nThe flaws were first reported by tech publication The Register. It also reported that the updates to fix the problems could causes Intel chips to operate 5 percent to 30 percent more slowly. ( bit.ly\/2CsRxkj ) \nIntel denied that the patches would bog down computers based on Intel chips. FILE PHOTO: Intel's logo is pictured during preparations at the CeBit computer fair, which will open its doors to the public on March 20, at the fairground in Hanover, Germany, March 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Fabian Bimmer\/File Photo \n\u201cIntel has begun providing software and firmware updates to mitigate these exploits,\u201d Intel said in a statement. \u201cContrary to some reports, any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time.\u201d \nARM spokesman Phil Hughes said that patches had already been shared with the companies\u2019 partners, which include many smartphone manufacturers. \n\u201cThis method only works if a certain type of malicious code is already running on a device and could at worst result in small pieces of data being accessed from privileged memory,\u201d Hughes said in an email. \nAMD chips are also affected by at least one variant of a set of security flaws but that it can be patched with a software update. The company said it believes there \u201cis near zero risk to AMD products at this time.\u201d \nGoogle said in a blog post that Android phones running the latest security updates are protected, as are its own Nexus and Pixel phones with the latest security updates. Gmail users do not need to take any additional action to protect themselves, but users of its Chromebooks, Chrome web browser and many of its Google Cloud services will need to install updates. \nAmazon Web Services, a cloud computing service used by businesses, said that most of its internet servers were already patched and the rest were in the process of being patched. \nThe defect affects the so-called kernel memory on Intel x86 processor chips manufactured over the past decade, The Register reported citing unnamed programmers, allowing users of normal applications to discern the layout or content of protected areas on the chips. \nThat could make it possible for hackers to exploit other security bugs or, worse, expose secure information such as passwords, thus compromising individual computers or even entire server networks. \nDan Guido, chief executive of cyber security consulting firm Trail of Bits, said that businesses should quickly move to update vulnerable systems, saying he expects hackers to quickly develop code they can use to launch attacks that exploit the vulnerabilities. \u201cExploits for these bugs will be added to hacker\u2019s standard toolkits,\u201d said Guido. \nShares in Intel were down by 3.4 percent following the report but nudged back up 1.2 percent to $44.70 in after-hours trading while shares in AMD were up 1 percent to $11.77, shedding many of the gains they had made earlier in the day when reports suggested its chips were not affected. \nIt was not immediately clear whether Intel would face any significant financial liability arising from the reported flaw. \n\u201cThe current Intel problem, if true, would likely not require CPU replacement in our opinion. However the situation is fluid,\u201d Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities in New York said in a note, adding it could hurt the company\u2019s reputation.

And Canada, which plans to legalize recreational and medical marijuana nationwide by fall , has some of the most \"420-friendly\" markets around.\nMedMen CEO and co-founder Adam Bierman took the stage on Wednesday at a cannabis conference hosted by Canaccord Genuity in Vancouver. He plans a reverse takeover with a listed shell company rather than an initial public offering.\n\"There is so much excitement now around legalization nationally coming in Canada. There is so much excitement about the fact that California, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts all legalized recreational marijuana,\" Bierman said.\n\"The Canadian public markets offer access to a lot of capital, with a lot of certainty and a lot of speed, and there is this appetite among global investors to invest in a U.S. play,\" he said. \"Specifically, global investors want to invest in a U.S. play that has California exposure. Now is the time where it makes the most sense.\"\nSource: MedMen MedMen operates sleek, airy dispensaries that are designed to attract marijuana customers of all types \u2014 a far cry from the psychedelic-style head shops of days past. The company also has two funds with about $150 million to encourage investment in marijuana businesses. They caught the attention of some big names in finance, such as former BlackRock Chief Investment Officer Chris Leavy, who chaired the first fund, and former Goldman Sachs investment banker Ruth Epstein.\nMost of these assets have been rolled into MedMen Enterprises in preparation for a reverse takeover to list on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE), an alternative exchange. Bierman anticipates MedMen will list sometime in the second quarter of 2018. MedMen is currently searching for a partner.\nCanada's largest exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), lists few cannabis companies, according to information provided by the exchange. The combined capitalization of big names that are listed there, such as Canopy Growth and Aphria , among others, exceeds $20 billion. All companies currently listed on TSX are based in Canada.\nThe CSE is a bit more lenient. The exchange currently trades close to 60 cannabis-related companies, many that are headquartered in the U.S. The market caps for these companies are significantly smaller. U.S. companies listed on the CSE, such as Alternate Health and iAnthus Capital, have a combined market cap of about $230 million, according to public information on the CSE's website.\nIn the U.S., the major exchanges have stringent listing requirements, including revenue and market capitalization hurdles.\nThis poses a major problem for marijuana companies. Until recently most investors viewed the entire cannabis industry as far too risky. Some creative investment solutions have emerged, such as ETF Managers Group's Alternative Harvest ETF, but most institutional investors still won't touch the stuff.\nSource: MedMen \"To get on NYSE and Nasdaq you have to be huge,\" CSE CEO Richard Carleton said. \"In Canada you continue to be able to develop public companies in the public space. We know how to do smaller deals for smaller companies on the stock exchange.\"\nContinued legal restrictions and hurdles to list on major exchanges in the U.S. are prompting more American cannabis companies to eye Canadian exchanges.\n\"I have a strong pipeline of Canadian and U.S. companies that have applied to list on the exchange,\" Carleton said. \"That tells me that there is a lot of room to grow in terms of build-out of the legal cannabis structure in the U.S.\"\nThe local financial system benefits as well. In this case, Canada will have an advantage on intellectual property, investment dollars and tax money from the cannabis industry, as well as developing investment opportunities in cannabis.\n\"This is the United States' industry to lose,\" Dayton said. \"Because of the federal-state conflict we have here, countries like Canada, Germany, Brazil, Israel have a unique opportunity to take this industry from the U.S.\"\nWATCH: TD Ameritrade says pot and bitcoin drive record trading levels show chapters TD Ameritrade CEO: Pot and bitcoin drive record trading levels 8:30 AM ET Wed, 24 Jan 2018 | 03:41"}

{"published":"2018-01-17T22:17:00.000+02:00","title":"Stock market's rapid January rise has already surpassed many full-year forecasts from Wall Street","text":"Stock prices could soon be outrunning the herd.\nThe S&P 500 has risen so quickly this month that it has already topped or matched many of Wall Street analysts' freshly minted 2018 full-year forecasts, collected in CNBC's strategist survey. The median target for year-end is currently 2,975, about a 6 percent gain from current levels. The S&P 500, however, has already added nearly 5 percent since Jan. 1.\nWhen it broke 2,800 for the first time Tuesday morning, the S&P had run through four of 18 strategists' 2018 targets, and it is now heading for four more \u2013 at the 2,850 level. The S&P jumped more than 20 points Wednesday, to just over 2,800 after Tuesday's sell-off.\nHalf the strategists have targets of 3,000 or more, and the highest is 3,150 at UBS.\nThe question is whether strategists will ratchet up numbers, like they did last year, as the S&P surged nearly 20 percent into the year-end. Or, will analysts hold onto the view that 2018 could be more volatile with more dips than the market has seen in quite a while. Tuesday's trading would suggest the latter, after the S&P 500 surged to 2,807 before falling back to close at 2,776.\n\"The market's acting like it is in the early stages of the silly season,\" said Wells Fargo Investment Institute strategist Scott Wren, noting the erratic trading that sent stocks sharply higher Tuesday morning before gains were wiped out. Wren's year-end target of 2,850 is not that far from Tuesday's high, and he says there's upside risk to his forecast.\n\"Where we could be wrong is our GDP number is too low and that inflation stays down and the Fed doesn't really do anything. That would potentially push things higher,\" Wren said. \"If our earnings estimate was low and our GDP number was low, that's an upside risk.\" Wren says he's got a 2.9 percent GDP forecast for this year.\nBut even though Wren says there's plenty of chasing going on with investors fearful of missing out, that trend still has a ways to go before the bull run is over. \"I think we're in the early stages of that. It could play out over a year or two,\" he said.\nBut there are also warning signs, and some forecasters are sticking with their targets, even though the market has already passed them by. Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson, for one, is keeping his target of 2,750 by Dec. 1, but in a note Tuesday, he conceded that the market could end well above his target and meet what he calls his bull case for 3,000. Wilson set the 2,750 target in November, and had expected the market to peak at that level in 2018.\n\"The bottom line is that we have entered the late cycle euphoria stage we predicted a year ago. Because the tax cuts occurred earlier and are larger than we expected, it is more likely the S&P 500 will reach our bull case of 3,000 before it's over. We just want to make sure investors appreciate this is higher, not lower risk than the rally we experienced last year\u2014the opposite of what we are hearing from many clients and other commentators,\" Wilson wrote in a note.\nThe surge in stocks has also come in the weeks following passage of the tax bill that slices the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, starting this year. That caused analysts to rethink earnings targets, and many upped earnings expectations, as a result. But those adjustments are continuing, and stocks could move higher in response, analysts say.\nCRFA strategists bumped their 2018 target to 2,800 in December, but are now waiting to see what companies say about the tax bill impact during the fourth quarter earnings calls before they revisit their forecast.\n\"Part of our thesis was the tax reform numbers weren't yet baked in. Earnings growth was closer to 11.5 percent, and now it's at 14 percent. That has moved up rapidly and it's still moving,\" said Lindsey Bell, CFRA strategist. \"We're getting a little nervous about the valuations. This year we're only a handful of days into the new year and the S&P is off to a spectacular start\u2026We just thought, let's see what earnings season brings.\""}

Adjusted sales volumes were also lower in Egypt, primarily due to the impact of improving Brent oil prices on the cost recovery mechanisms in Apache\u2019s production sharing contracts. As a result of these factors, the company expects fourth-quarter adjusted international production in the range of 138,000 to 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day and base-level production volumes to be lower than planned going into 2018.\nIn the United States, fourth-quarter production is expected to be at the high end of the company\u2019s guidance range of 218,000 to 224,000 per day BOE, driven primarily by strong quarter-over-quarter growth in the Permian Basin.\nJohn J. Christmann IV, Apache's chief executive officer and president, said, \u201cRobust Brent crude prices enabled our international operations to generate strong free cash flow during the fourth quarter despite the reduction in production volumes. In the Permian, we delivered our second quarter in a row of strong oil production growth; and, at Alpine High, we achieved our production target of more than 25,000 BOE per day by the end of December.\u201d\nTo further assist analysts with their fourth-quarter production and earnings models, the company is also providing the following estimates:\nRealized loss on oil and gas price derivatives (before tax): $49 million\nDry hole costs (before tax): $45 - $50 million\nEgypt tax barrels: 32,000 to 36,000 BOE per day\nFourth-quarter 2017 earnings call\nApache Corporation will release fourth-quarter and year-end results on its website at www.apachecorp.com and investor.apachecorp.com as well as on Twitter (@ApacheCorp) at 7 a.m. Central time Thursday, Feb. 22, 2018, followed by a conference call to discuss its results at 1 p.m. Central time.\nThe conference call will be webcast from Apache's website at www.apachecorp.com and investor.apachecorp.com , and the webcast replay will be archived there as well.

Elaine Lies 4 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - To quad or not to quad would not even be a question for any man aiming for the podium at this year\u2019s Olympics, as more of the complicated jumps fill routines and bring in the points. \nBut how far the sport - and skaters\u2019 bodies - will go in pursuit of the jumps, which require four complete revolutions before landing, is unknown. \nAt the recent Grand Prix Final in Japan, Nathan Chen, who has steadily racked up jumping records this year, including landing seven clean quads at the U.S. Championships this past spring, won the men\u2019s competition with tries for at least five quads in his free skate. \nHot on his heels was Japan\u2019s Shoma Uno, the first skater to successfully land a quad flip in international competition, who ultimately won the free part of the competition with a quad-filled programme but trailed Chen overall by half a point. \nBut both cleanly landed only a few of the quads, prompting questions about whether it was not smarter to lower the level of their programmes in the interest of success. \n\u201cIf you keep on putting quads into a programme, it does kind of put your stability at risk,\u201d Uno told a news conference. \n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to show the crowds perfection, I want to show them that I\u2019m growing as a skater. So I\u2019ll go on with the challenging routines.\u201d \nQuad jumps have a 30-year history in competition, dating from Canada\u2019s Kurt Browning, who in 1988 became the first person to land a legal quadruple jump - a quad toeloop. \nSince then, five different varieties of the high-risk jump have become such an essential part of men\u2019s skating that no man has won Olympic gold quadlessly since 1994 - with one exception. \nThat was U.S. skater Evan Lysacek, who at the 2010 Vancouver Games defeated Russian defending champion Yevgeny Plushenko who said Lysacek had danced \u201crather than skating like a man.\u201d \nNot everyone loves the trend towards athleticism required by the jumps. FILE PHOTO: Figure Ice Skating - ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final - Men Free Skating - Nagoya, Japan - December 8, 2017. Nathan Chen of the U.S is seen in action. REUTERS\/Issei Kato\/File Photo \nTwo-time U.S. Olympian Johnny Weir, who confessed that when he was competing quads were his \u201cnemesis,\u201d said he felt emphasis on the jumps - which command high points, especially in the second half of any program - has perhaps gone too far. \n\u201cIt isn\u2019t as enjoyable to watch as it was from our era,\u201d Weir told Reuters in a telephone interview. \u201cNow it seems skaters will try to do quads that they aren\u2019t comfortable with because of the points.\u201d \nDefending Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu and Spain\u2019s Javier Fernandez, both of whom can land jumps and are beautiful skaters, have achieved a good balance of athleticism and artistry, he added, whereas quads tend to be \u201ctechnique, mathematics and body type.\u201d \nPatrick Chan, who at 27 is one of the older skaters on the circuit and came second to Hanyu in Sochi, has also expressed reservations. \n\u201cNathan\u2019s trump card is the quads, mine is a little more understated,\u201d he told Reuters in Toronto. \u201cFor me, it is the fact I have more experience. \u201d \nAnd the women may follow, though so far only retired Japanese skater Miki Ando has landed a quad in competition, at the junior level and back in 2002. \n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that the younger generation has started to actively study these jumps,\u201d Evgenia Medvedeva, who will be the gold medal favourite if she is able to compete at the Games, said at a Moscow news conference after a Grand Prix event. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s the next step of figure skating.\u201d \nThere is talk about possibly limiting the number of quads, but skaters oppose the idea. Russia\u2019s Mikhail Kolyada, who took bronze at the Grand Prix Final, said the jumps are important to add energy to routines, which attracts audiences. \nBut rather than capping the number of quads, perhaps more points should be given for other elements, U.S. Olympian Adam Rippon told Reuters. \n\u201cI think if you made different point opportunities, you\u2019d see different skaters come forward so it\u2019s not just that a sloppy programme with quads always wins,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt would be different skaters bringing different parts of skating. It\u2019s not just jumps.\u201d Additional reporting by Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber in MOSCOW and Steve Keating in TORONTO, writing by Elaine Lies; editing by Amlan Chakraborty"}

Korea talks are significant but not foolproof","text":"North Korea and South Korea appear to be embracing talks aimed at reducing tensions between the two neighbors and nemeses, just days after North Korea's leader threatened that he has a \"nuclear button\" ready on his desk.\nRare talks to improve inter-Korean relations appeared to be going well Tuesday, with North Korea saying that it will send as many athletes as possible to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea in February .\nTalks in the border village of Panmunjom seemingly went so well that South Korean delegates suggested a \"family reunion\" for next month's Lunar New Year, to reunite relatives separated in both countries since the 1950-53 Korean War and one of only a number of sporadic reunions that have been held over the years.\nSouth Korea also proposed inter-Korean military talks to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula and the South's Foreign Ministry said later on Tuesday that it was willing to consider temporarily lifting sanctions against North Korea to facilitate the Olympic visit.\nNorth Korea's delegates meanwhile said in a keynote speech following the discussions that they hoped \"to solve all inter-Korean issues through dialogue.\" News also came later on Tuesday that North Korea had completed technical maintenance needed to reopen a military hotline with South Korea.\nHigh alert Both sides concluded the first round of talks promising further discussions, though somewhat tellingly the North Korean delegation returned to the Panmungak (a North Korean building in the infamous demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea) on the north side of the border for lunch, according to NBC News.\nThe fast-thawing relations are in stark contrast with the atmosphere at the start of the year, when North Korean President Kim Jong Un gave a New Year's Day address in which he said the Communist state's nuclear weapons could reach anywhere in the United States \u2014 an important ally with South Korea \u2014 and threatened that he has a nuclear button on his desk.\nThe address provoked a furious response from President Donald Trump who tweeted that he had a \"much bigger and more powerful\" nuclear button . The comments prompted fears that one or the other of the impulsive leaders could press their buttons, making this week's rapprochement even more extraordinary.\nAlison Evans, deputy head of Asia-Pacific Country Risk, IHS Markit told CNBC Tuesday that the talks were a \"positive change\" but not foolproof.\n\"It's easy to be cynical about these talks and think that North Korea is perhaps trying to get something out of South Korea that it wants, but nonetheless there are reasons to be enthusiastic about these talks, they are the first ministerial talks since December 2015 and indeed daily contact between the South and North Korea governments and military has been cut since February 2016 \u2026 So I still think this is a positive change,\" Evans said.\nshow chapters North Korea likely to conduct further missile tests this year: Expert 13 Hours Ago | 02:18 \"(However) I think there are reasons to still be on high alert,\" she said. \"North Korea is open to talks and wants to improve relations with South Korea but I still think that North Korea is committed to developing its nuclear weapons and its ballistic missiles and in that vein, we're still likely to see more tests later this year.\"\nMore missiles, more problems North Korea has largely been seen as a rogue state by the international community for its pursuit of a nuclear program and has been on the receiving end of international condemnation and sanctions.\nIt has attracted disapproval from most quarters (although China remains an ostensible ally) for its continued nuclear tests and missile launches, the international concern being that it could attach a nuclear warhead to a missile.\nIn September 2017, North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test since 2006. In all, Pyongyang has tested a total of 23 missiles since Trump took office, and 15 of those tests involved nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. The November 2017 launch of which appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, flew further than any of Kim Jong Un's previous tests. The North claimed it could reach anywhere in mainland America.\nKPPA\/Pool via Bloomberg Cho Myoung-gyon, South Korea's unification minister, left, and Ri Son Gwon, chairman of North Korea\u2019s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, shake hands while posing for photographs during a meeting in the village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in Paju, South Korea, on Tuesday, Jan. 9, 2018. The launches have ratcheted up tensions between the state and the U.S., with Trump warning North Korea after the November missile launch not to make a \"fatal miscalculation.\"\nAlthough North Korea has been given some priority by Trump, the U.S. has said it will only consider negotiations to end the nuclear weapons crisis if the state ceases to fire ballistic missiles, something that North Korea appears unlikely to give up.\nIan Bremmer, head of Eurasia Group, said on Monday that the latest talks were a positive sign, as well as North Korea's attendance at the Winter Olympics, but added that the state was likely to return to its missile testing.\n\"The North Koreans see their only effective defense against a more antagonistic and unpredictable United States as strengthening their proven deterrent capability against the American homeland. That means perfecting ICBM launch and reentry capabilities; which likely includes a (considerably more provocative) full horizontal test into the Pacific Ocean,\" Bremmer said in a note Monday.\n\"President Trump and, most recently, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, say they'll accept no negotiations absent a willingness on the part of North Korea to cease tests (and potentially commit to denuclearization); North Korea sees significant expansion of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs as a precondition to any negotiation.\""}

The rules are aimed at tackling \u201cdisorder\u201d in the banking sector, including the abuse of rights by major shareholders and the prevalence of \u201cinvisible shareholders\u201d. \nAnd in separate measures announced on Saturday, the CBRC said it would require firms to step up their risk management and disclosure around entrusted loans, a form of business-to-business financing. \nUnder the new commercial lender shareholding regulations, a single investor can hold 5 percent or more, considered a major shareholding, of no more than two commercial banks, or a controlling stake of no more than one lender. \nAny stake purchase of more than 5 percent must be approved by the CBRC and major shareholders of commercial lenders cannot hold interests in the same institution via financial products. \nThe measures, which follow draft regulations released in November, also require major shareholders to disclose their ownership structures up to the ultimate beneficial holder. \nThe regulatory moves could have implications for companies such as Anbang Insurance Group, which holds multiple stakes in commercial lenders. \nAs of Sept. 30, Anbang Insurance Group held a 15.54 percent in China Minsheng Bank 600016 as a result of a direct stake held by Anbang Life and through two separate financial products, company filings show. \nThe Beijing-based insurer also held a greater than 13 percent interest in China Merchants Bank Co ( 600036.SS ) through its property and casualty insurance unit during the same period. \nThe CBRC\u2019s new rules regulating entrusted loans, published on its website on Saturday, include strengthening risk management, supervision, and disclosures on the source and intended use of the funds. \nEntrusted loans are a form of inter-company financing in which one firm serves as the ultimate lender and records the loan asset on its balance sheet while banks act as intermediaries for a fee. \nThe entrusted loans market has grown rapidly in recent years and had some positive effects, the CBRC said, but a lack of standardized regulations meant there were \u201ccertain hidden risks\u201d. \nIn recent months, Chinese regulators have introduced a series of new measures aimed at controlling risk and leverage in the financial system, with everything from lending practices to shadow banking under the microscope.

{"published":"2018-01-03T12:44:00.000+02:00","title":"Altcoin Bitcoin Rivals Ripple, Litecoin Catching Up | Fortune","text":"By Bloomberg 10:44 AM EST \nBitcoin alternatives are closing the gap with the market leader after names like stellar and cardano became red hot as 2017 was closing. \nThe biggest cryptocurrency\u2019s share of market value has fallen to a record 36 percent from 56 percent a month ago, according to CoinMarketCap prices for coins and tokens. Stellar, designed for cross-border payments, has more than doubled in the first trading days of this year, achieving a record market cap of more than $13 billion. \nThat kind of move raises questions as to whether speculators will drive up second-tier digital coins at the expense of bitcoin, even though they have different purposes. The paper value of all cryptocurrencies combined has more than doubled to almost $700 billion in the past month. \n\u201cThe altcoins today, in large part, are not trying to be bitcoin competitors,\u201d said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research LLP in London. \u201cThey are doing something else entirely \u2014 ethereum as a smart-contracts platform, iota as a machine-economy token, ripple for interbank payments, and so on.\u201d How each is used \u201cshould become increasingly relevant as the novelty of crypto wears off.\u201d \nRelative performance is now a multibillion-dollar question as professional investors search for ways to value digital assets that seem to defy traditional techniques, such as profit and dividend potential for equities, or industrial-demand outlooks for commodities. Correlation, for example, is one of many technical-analysis tools used across asset classes in forecasting, and altcoins historically have moved mostly in step with bitcoin. \nWhile there were many periods of disparity, on balance the group rose or fell together, a Bloomberg survey of more than 5,000 data points show from CoinMarketCap and CoinCap prices. With bitcoin rivals now making bigger gains, it matters more whether the group continues moving mostly in sync \u2014 as they largely have done ever since the early days when enthusiasts were mostly computer programmers and libertarians. \nWhile naysayers insist the crypto market has many signs of a bubble, speculating has been promising for many who bought second-tier coins. Ethereum, the second-largest by market value, has roughly tripled in the last two months. Cardano is up more than 40-fold in the period. That compares with an approximate doubling for bitcoin, which went more mainstream in December by sporting its first U.S. futures contracts. \nBitcoin was little changed on Wednesday and hasn\u2019t gained for two successive days since touching a record high on Dec. 18. \nThe technical shortcomings of bitcoin signal its benchmark status may be taken away someday by a second-generation rival, according to Mike McGlone, a commodity strategist at Bloomberg Industries who likens the market to internet-based companies a few decades ago. \nFor a look at using Bloomberg functions to compare with dot-com bubble, click here. \n\u201cWhen the frenzy subsides, 2Gs should continue to gain on bitcoin, which has flaws and where futures can be shorted,\u201d McGlone wrote in a note last week. \u201cEthereum appears prime to assume benchmark status, though bitcoin forks ripple and litecoin are the primary up-and-coming contenders.\u201d \nWith a $216 billion market value on Dec. 31, bitcoin was often the first stop \u2014 and maybe the last \u2014 for investors who then maybe dabbled in smaller, more volatile tokens. A surge in investor interest typically benefits the smallest more, simply because they have smaller market values, said Spencer Bogart, a partner at Blockchain Capital LLC in San Francisco. \n\u201cThis goes both directions though: often when crypto markets are falling you see a rotation out of the long-tail of crypto assets and into bitcoin, the \u2018king of crypto,\u2019 which is rightfully perceived to have the most staying power in the ecosystem,\u201d Bogart said. Crypto Party \nAs the crypto party grew bigger, the crashers \u2014 blue-suited investors and hedge funds \u2014 have purchased mostly bitcoin, and they have different buying criteria than early converts who may have moved on to less-liquid units like dash or monero, according to industry observers. The diluted investor base may weaken the yoke to bitcoin, the biggest by market value, they say. \n\u201cThe capital base of these markets is evolving rapidly,\u201d said Kyle Samani, managing partner of Multicoin Capital, a digital-asset hedge fund in Texas. \u201cBefore the recent bitcoin bull run, the investor base in crypto was mostly engineers, nerds, and libertarians. \u201d \nIn the U.S., Samani of Multicoin Capital says he sees a division between what\u2019s on offer at the popular Coinbase exchange, and everything else. \n\u201cMost retail investors are only buying assets available on Coinbase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should continue to see a decoupling between what\u2019s on Coinbase versus other altcoins.\u201d SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT "}

North Korea is keen to talk, but remains steadfast on its nuclear program. Seoul seeks to allow North Korean athletes at Winter Olympics. Published 11 Hours Ago 1 Hour Ago | 00:50 \nSouth Korea on Tuesday offered talks with North Korea amid a standoff over its weapons programs, a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he was open to negotiations but that his country would push ahead with \"mass producing\" nuclear warheads. \nThe offer for high-level talks next Tuesday had been discussed with the United States, the South's unification minister said, while a decision on whether to push back a massive joint military drill between South Korea and the United States until after the Winter Olympics was pending. \nTension has been rising over North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes, which it pursues in defiance of years of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both Pyongyang and the White House. The North sees the regular war drills between the South and the United States as preparations for war. \n\"We look forward to candidly discussing interests from both sides face-to-face with North Korea along with the North's participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics,\" Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon told reporters. \n\"I repeat: The government is open to talking with North Korea, regardless of time, location and form.\" \nCho said he expects the dialogue at the border village of Panmunjom, if it happens, to be focused on North Korea's participation at the Olympics in February, but other issues would likely arise, including the denuclearization of North Korea. \nShould the talks be held on Jan. 9, it would be the first such dialogue since a vice-ministerial meeting in December 2015. \nThe offer landed after a New Year's Day speech by Kim who said he was \"open to dialogue\" with Seoul, and for North Korean athletes to possibly take part in the Winter Games, but he persistently declared North Korea a nuclear power. \nAfter welcoming Kim's address, South Korean President Moon Jae-in had asked his government earlier in the day to move as quickly as possible to bring North Korea to the Olympics. \nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the recent positive comments from both sides about improving relations, and Kim's remarks about participating in the upcoming Olympics, were a \"good thing\". \n\"China welcomes and supports North Korea and South Korea taking earnest efforts to treat this as an opportunity to improve mutual relations, promote the alleviation of the situation on the Korean peninsula and realize denuclearisation on the peninsula.\" \nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that sanctions and other pressures were starting to have a big impact on North Korea but he withheld judgment on Pyongyang's offer to talk. \n\"Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time,\" Trump wrote in a Twitter post, using his nickname for Kim. \"Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!\" 'Deep breath' needed \nAnalysts said Kim's address was an attempt to weaken the U.S.-South Korean alliance. \nChun Yung-woo, a former South Korean national security adviser, said Seoul should have taken more time before reacting to Kim's comments. \n\"I regret the government had even lost the flexibility to spend one day or two taking a deep breath and meticulously analysing Kim Jong Un's ulterior motive before hastily issuing a welcoming statement,\" he said. \n\"The government will have to strive more to come up with a countermeasure not to get caught in a trap set by Kim Jong Un.\" \nChoi Moon-soon, governor of Gangwon Province where the Olympics are to be held next month, has proposed South Korea send cruise ships to bring North Korean athletes and officials to Pyeongchang, according to South Korean media. \nChoi met North Korean sports official Mun Woong in China on Dec. 18 on the sidelines of a international youth football tournament where North and South Korea soccer teams competed, the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper reported. \nThe governor did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment. \nThis week's exchanges follow a year dominated by fiery threats from Kim and Trump, who vowed to destroy North Korea if threatened, even as U.S. diplomats pushed for a diplomatic solution. \nNorth Korea, which regularly threatens to destroy the United States, South Korea and Japan, tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile in November, which it said was capable of delivering a warhead to anywhere in the United States. \nKim said in a New Year's Day speech on Monday he would consider sending a delegation to the Olympics. \n\"North Korea's participation in the Winter Games will be a good opportunity to showcase the national pride and we wish the Games will be a success. Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility,\" Kim said. \nNorth Korea would focus in 2018 on \"mass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment\". \n\"The whole territory of the U.S. is within the range of our nuclear strike and a nuclear button is always on the desk of my office and this is just a reality, not a threat,\" he said, while emphasising that the weapons would only be used if North Korea was threatened. \nThe Commerce Ministry in China, North Korea's lone major ally, also said it would continue to fully implement United Nations sanctions on North Korea. \nTrump said on Twitter last week that China has been \"caught\" allowing oil into North Korea and said such moves would prevent \"a friendly solution\" to the crisis.

Investors' eyes are currently focused on a number of political developments in Latin America's largest economy, such as a corruption trial for leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva at the end of January. Should a conviction against the popular former leader be upheld, he would barred from running in October presidential elections, which would please investors who widely seem him as the left's best chance of winning. In recent days, the cabinet of conservative President Michel Temer has accelerated a reshuffle, as multiple cabinet members prepare to run for Congress in the coming elections. \"Political maneuvering accelerated and a strong inflow of foreign investors is supporting a stock market rally at the beginning of 2018,\" analysts at Guide Investimentos wrote in a note to clients. The Bovespa climbed 1.31 percent in afternoon trading, hitting intraday record highs for the second straight session, and the index looked on track to book its ninth straight trading day in the black. The worst performing major market in the region was Argentina, where investors began booking gains after 11 straight bull sessions. The Merval equities index had ticked up a relatively modest 0.33 percent after lingering in the red for much of the day, while the country's peso currency had fallen 0.78 percent. Analysts said there were lingering jitters in the market over the Argentine central bank's decision in late December to ease the official inflation target for 2018. \"Monetary policy continues to be a focus of uncertainty, even after the change in the inflation target to 15 percent annually was made official,\" analysts at Delphos Investment wrote.

REUTERS\/Yves Herman Missouri, home to Monsanto\u2019s headquarters, along with other farm states including Iowa and Indiana, said in court documents on Tuesday that the warnings would be misleading because there is no definite link between glyphosate and cancer.\nMidwest businesses would need to include warnings on glyphosate products if California requires them or stop selling such goods because they may end up in the Golden State, according to the states\u2019 filing.\nCalifornia added glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto\u2019s Roundup herbicide, to its list of cancer-causing chemicals in July 2017 and will require products containing the chemical to carry warnings by July 2018.\nThe state acted after the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded in 2015 that glyphosate was \u201cprobably carcinogenic.\u201d\n\u201cThe mandate imposes confusing and potentially inconsistent obligations on non-resident businesses, creating a strong incentive to abandon glyphosate markets altogether,\u201d the states\u2019 filing said.\nFor more than 40 years, farmers have applied glyphosate to crops, most recently on soybeans that Monsanto genetically engineered to resist the herbicide. Roundup is also sprayed on residential lawns and golf courses.\nThe controversy in California is a headache for the company as it faces a crisis around another herbicide based on a chemical known as dicamba that has been linked to U.S. crop damage.\nMonsanto, which is being acquired by Bayer AG for $63.5 billion, developed the dicamba-based product following an increase in weeds resistant to glyphosate.\nThe 11 states are supporting a federal lawsuit Monsanto, the National Association of Wheat Growers and other agricultural groups filed in November to stop the state from requiring glyphosate warnings.\nMonsanto said Wednesday it had discussed California\u2019s mandate with officials in agricultural states as it proceeded with the lawsuit.\nCalifornia\u2019s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), which is named in the lawsuit, declined to comment. The office previously said it stands by the decision to include glyphosate on the state\u2019s list of products known to cause cancer, as required under a rule known as Proposition 65.\n\u201cProposition 65 is 30 years old and for every one of those years there have been strenuous attempts to kill it on the ground that it\u2019s different from other states,\u201d said David Roe, the rule\u2019s primary author.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve always failed.\u201d\nReporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Matthew Lewis\n "}

Assad has defeated rebels in many parts of western Syria with critical help from Russia and Iran. \nThe recent military escalation in western Syria has included an unprecedented attack by a squadron of drones on Russian military bases and has cast a shadow over Moscow\u2019s efforts to convene a Syria peace congress later this month. \nThe Hezbollah-run news service said the army and its allies were repelling a \u201cfierce assault\u201d by the Nusra Front, formerly al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in the Syrian war, and groups linked to it. \nRebels fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) said in a statement they had set up a joint operations room to repel the offensive and to take back areas seized by the government in northeastern Hama and southern Idlib. \n\u201cThe operation is to hit the belly of the regime deep into liberated territories and to encircle their advancing forces,\u201d said Abdul Hakim al Rahamon, a senior official in Jaish al Nasr, an FSA faction taking part. \nTahrir al-Sham (HTS), an alliance led by the Nusra Front, the dominant force in Idlib, said it had already made gains. \n\u201cWith Allah\u2019s blessings we drew plans and prepared ourselves and are encircling them,\u201d said Abu al Naji, a commander from Tahrir al Sham. \u201cWe have killed many.\u201d \nRebels said they had captured some 15 villages and seized 60 government fighters. A Syrian military source denied this and dismissed rebel talk of a counter attack as propaganda. The source said fierce battles were however underway in the area and army advances were continuing. \nRebel sources said warplanes had struck Khan Sheikhoun and Saraqeb, two major population centres in Idlib province that are among several towns that have been targeted in the latest offensive. \nThe latest push by the army and its allies has alarmed Turkey which has been deploying forces inside northern Idlib and setting up bases which it says are part of agreements with Iran and Russia over a descalation zone in Idlib. \nThe Turkish government said the Idlib offensive was endangering the effort to reach a resolution of the conflict and accused the Syrian government of using the pretext of fighting militants to wage a widescale attack. \nAnkara is concerned that wider fighting in the province could bring tens of thousands of Syrians fleeing from the battlefields on its borders far beyond the numbers now fleeing. \nMany Syrians living in rebel-held areas see Turkey\u2019s military intervention as a bulwark against a relentless bombing campaign by Syrian and Russian airforces they blame for killing and injuring hundreds of civilians in urban areas in recent months, away from the frontlines.

Hopefully Lockheed will say something [in its earnings report] that causes a quick dip,\" he said.\nTuesday: Pfizer, McDonald's, Advanced Micro Devices Pfizer : Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer will report earnings on Tuesday, but Cramer warned that investors shouldn't expect it to wow investors like AbbVie's quarter did.\n\"[AbbVie] is up $15 today thanks to, get this, earnings growth . Not buybacks, actual growth,\" Cramer said. \"I wouldn't hold your breath if you're waiting for that kind of thing from Pfizer.\"\nMcDonald's : Cramer praised the fast-food chain's turnaround under CEO Steve Easterbrook ahead of its Tuesday earnings report.\n\"Easterbrook has turned this aging hulk around to the point where it's now doing three times the same-store sales of Starbucks in the U.S., and while I don't have a man-crush on him, I'm certainly blown away by how he keeps delivering,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\nAMD : Encouraged by Intel's successful quarter , Cramer expected good earnings results from AMD and hoped CEO Lisa Su would tell an optimistic story.\nWednesday: Boeing, Microsoft, Facebook Boeing : The Dow's top dog reports earnings on Wednesday. Despite Cramer's bullish long-term outlook for the company, he hoped this quarter would bring out sellers so that investors could get an opportunity to buy the roaring stock.\nMicrosoft : Cramer's outlook on Microsoft improved after Intel reported that the rate of decline in personal computer sales was slowing, even as sales were still down 2 percent.\n\"This relative improvement, along with the strength in the data center business, allowed Intel to thrive,\" he said. \"Microsoft wins with both the P.C. and the data center, with the latter fitting into the company's booming Azure cloud business.\"\nFacebook : Even though Cramer predicted Facebook would blow away the earnings estimates with its report, he expected management to talk down revenues and talk up expenses on the conference call.\n\"That will spook people,\" he warned. \"To make matters worse, Facebook will open the selling window for their shareholders who work at the company and we will see some first-class stock dumping from their top executives. So even if the numbers are as fabulous as I'm anticipating, the action's just going to be nightmarish.\"\nThursday: Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple Alibaba : The Chinese e-commerce giant will deliver its earnings report on Thursday, and Cramer expects a \"total blowout, because they're the masters of under-promise and over-deliver.\"\nThe \"Mad Money\" host recommended that investors either buy the stock before the quarter drops, or wait for the typical \"down leg\" in the stock post-earnings.\nAlphabet : Cramer hoped for news of repatriation or a share buyback program from the massive Google parent, but had otherwise dim expectations for its earnings report.\n\"I think Alphabet disappoints and then spends the rest of the quarter trading up as people realize [that] maybe that quarter wasn't so bad,\" he said. \"Be careful.\"\nAmazon : \"I see Amazon saying that it's going to spend a fortune building a new headquarters and that hurts the stock even after a fabulous quarter, giving you still one more chance to buy,\" Cramer said in anticipation of Amazon's Thursday earnings report.\nApple : Cramer wanted to prepare investors for the inevitable analyst-led shakedown of consumer products giant Apple after it reports earnings on Thursday.\n\"They'll seize on weakening sales of the new iPhone X, so I've just got to get you ready. I'm not so glib as to say that there won't be anything wrong with the quarter. There will be. There may be plenty of things wrong. But even if it's perfect, the analysts will find some way to make Apple look bad. It's what they do,\" he said.\nEven so, Cramer said the potential for Apple to start a share buyback program or boost its dividend was real, giving shareholders a potential catalyst for another rally.\nFriday: Exxon Mobil, Chevron Cramer expected the usual pattern to occur for multinational oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron when they report their quarterly results on Friday.\n\"The first will likely be lackluster and the second will be unabashedly positive,\" he said. \"That's been the pattern for a year now. I bet this time will be no different.\"\nFinal thoughts \"Here's the bottom line: the Super Bowl of earnings, unlike the actual Super Bowl, never lets you down in terms of sheer excitement,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"I can't wait for the week to begin.

Now, members of Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives are starting to look ahead to potential alternatives to lead their party and country. \nMerkel\u2019s immediate fate depends on the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which votes on Sunday on whether their leaders should pursue coalition negotiations with her Christian Democrats after striking a preliminary deal last week. \nA \u201cno\u201d vote could force fresh elections as well as renewed debate on the issue of succession. \nInterviews by Reuters with more than a dozen party lawmakers indicate that the coalition talks have brought pressure from Merkel\u2019s party for new faces to be included in the next cabinet and prompted early conversations on a succession plan. \n\u201cWe need to talk about how the Union can renew itself,\u201d said Paul Ziemiak, who chairs the youth wing of the Union of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU), which run together in national elections on the same ticket. \nMerkel herself decided to seek a fourth term only after long reflection, and said in November 2016 she was seeking to stay on \u201cif health allows\u201d. In 1998 she was quoted as saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a half-dead wreck when I leave politics.\u201d On the other hand, she has not ruled out running for a 5th term. \nThe departure of Merkel, whose time in office has overlapped with four French presidents and four British prime ministers, risks creating a leadership vacuum in the European Union at a critical and uncertain time. \nTo smooth the transition, many in the CDU favour the idea of a gradual transition. That could involve handing the party chairmanship over first. \nOthers want Merkel to go sooner, however, frustrated with her handling of the refugee crisis, which hurt the party in Sept. 24\u2019s national election. Lamenting their loss of support to the far right, they complain she lacks the common touch. \nOne CDU lawmaker, who admired Merkel\u2019s mastery of detail but complained she lacks empathy, said that handing over the chancellorship early would strengthen her successor and the party in the next election, due in 2021. \n\u201cTactically, a chancellor has an incumbency advantage. That means there could be a change within the legislative period,\u201d the lawmaker said. SUPERCHARGED DEBATE \nThe succession debate has been supercharged by the inclusion of a clause in the preliminary coalition deal with the SPD that envisages a review of the next government\u2019s progress after two years to assess whether any changes to its mission are needed. \n\u201cA good time for Merkel to resign,\u201d one CDU lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said of the review. FILE PHOTO - Junge Union Deutschlands (Young Union of Germany) chairman Paul Ziemiak speaks during the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party congress in Karlsruhe, Germany December 14, 2015. Junge Union Deutschlands is the youth organisation of CDU and its Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union (CSU). REUTERS\/Kai Pfaffenbach \nThe risk of a handover at that point is that the SPD, if it agrees to govern with the conservatives, could pull the plug on the coalition and force fresh elections. But the situation also could come to a head far sooner. \nSunday\u2019s SPD vote is an immediate hurdle. If fresh elections are held, a small minority of lawmakers on the right of the CDU and in the CSU hope she would not run again for chancellor, according to those who spoke to Reuters. \nOthers reject this idea. \n\u201cWe are not of the view that if the SPD votes \u2018no\u2019 on Sunday, that this is the fault of the Union or the chancellor,\u201d said Detlef Seif, deputy EU spokesman for Merkel\u2019s conservative parliamentary bloc. \nMerkel has said she would run again for chancellor in the event of new elections. Voters still respect her, polls show. FILE PHOTO - German Deputy Finance Minister Jens Spahn speaks during an interview with Reuters in Berlin, Germany October 4, 2016. REUTERS\/Joachim Herrmann \nA Forsa poll published on Thursday showed support for Merkel\u2019s CDU\/CSU bloc rose to 34 percent, slightly above its election result of 32.9 percent. Support for the SPD slipped to 18 percent, below the 20.5 percent it achieved in the election. \nMany conservatives favour an orderly transition. \n\u201cI think a sensible succession arrangement must be found within the Union, but not at the moment given all that the chancellor has achieved, and not in the middle of a legislative period,\u201d said Seif. \nOne way, discussed by some other CDU lawmakers, of achieving an orderly handover would see Merkel relinquish the CDU party chair to a designated successor in 2020 while remaining chancellor, a scenario which would allow the person to raise their profile. \nMerkel has in the past said she believes the party chair and chancellorship should be held by the same person. \nThe CDU botched its last leadership handover. \nLate chancellor Helmut Kohl handed over the chairmanship to Wolfgang Schaeuble after his defeat at the 1998 election, only for them both to be compromised by a party funding scandal. Merkel then took over as leader, calling for a new start. \nSchaeuble, highly respected by conservatives for imposing fiscal discipline on the euro zone during his time as finance minister, is perhaps the only CDU figure who could lead a putsch to oust Merkel. A trusted, if awkward, ally for Merkel, he is unlikely to do so. \nYounger contenders are circling, notably deputy finance minister Jens Spahn. \n\u201cGermans love orderly processes, but when it comes to handing over the chancellorship it doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d said Carsten Nickel at advisory firm Teneo Intelligence. \u201cI think there will be a lot of movement in the CDU in the next four years.\u201d Editing by Sonya Hepinstall"}

These products are currently being registered with the US and European health authorities.\nThis range includes two series of microcatheters:\nThe first series was designed and developed to propose an optimization of microcatheters intra-arterial navigation to interventional radiologists, even in case of tortuous vascular network and hardly accessible lesions.\nThe second series possess the same optimized navigation qualities, while also incorporating unique anti-reflux technology. This effect is achieved thanks to side holes located in the terminal part of the catheter, which create a fluid barrier preventing the reflux of embolization microspheres.\nThis new technology makes it possible to administer more embolization microspheres to the targeted treatment area while also preventing them from refluxing upstream to arteries irrigating healthy tissues (non-targeted areas that need to be preserved).\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/2DaNLKk\nStandard microcatheter, positioned in the artery irrigating the tumor: the embolization microspheres travel not only downstream (desired effect) but also upstream (undesired effect), in an artery irrigating healthy tissues that need to be preserved.\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/2mfvCUj\nAnti-reflux microcatheter: the anti-reflux technology sends all the embolization microspheres downstream into the area to be treated. The healthy tissue continues to be irrigated by blood free of microspheres.\nInterventional radiology covers all the image-guided procedures which allow to diagnose and treat patients in a minimally invasive way. The scope of procedures is very large and includes, among the most wellknown, dilatation of stenotic arteries, tumor ablations, replacement of cardiac valves, vertebroplasty, etc. This market is several billion euros but is difficult to globally evaluate because of its heterogeneity. The segment that is mainly targeted today by Guerbet is arterial embolization for tumors and aneurysms; it is valued at about 600 million euros. In this segment, the part of microcatheters is around 120 million euros and is growing at an annual rate of 5% to 10%.\n\"This acquisition will fuel Guerbet's growth in interventional radiology and will round out its current portfolio. This new range of microcatheters will allow us to help interventional radiology teams deliver a higher quality of care during image-guided embolization procedures\" said Yves L'Epine, Guerbet's CEO.\n\"We are very pleased with this agreement between Guerbet and Accurate. We are confident that Guerbet has significant assets and resources that will enable our range of microcatheters to become market leader, in particular the microcatheters possessing the unique anti-reflux technology. It allows to augment embolization of target area while preventing damage to healthy tissues which must be preserved\" said Doctor Michael Tal, inventor and co-founder of Accurate.\nUnder this agreement, Guerbet will acquire 100% of Accurate's capital share, with an initial payment of 19.5 million euros and additional payments spread over several years depending on the achievement of regulatory and commercial objectives. The total amount of the acquisition will not exceed 57 million euros. The transaction is expected to start generating sales by the end of this year and be accretive from the 4 th quarter of 2019.\nAccurate, founded in 2015, will retain its structure in Israel and will continue to be led by its inventor, co-founder and CEO Eran Miller.\nAbout Guerbet\nGuerbet is a pioneer in the contrast agent field, with more than 90 years' experience, and is a leader in medical imaging worldwide. It offers a comprehensive range of pharmaceutical products, medical devices and services for diagnostic and interventional imaging, to improve treatment of patients. With 7% of revenue dedicated to R&D and more than 200 R&D employees distributed amongst its three centers in France and the United States, Guerbet is a substantial investor in research and innovation.

{"published":"2018-01-20T02:00:00.000+02:00","title":"Facebook, Twitter Take New Steps to Combat Fake News and Manipulation","text":"Jonathan Vanian, FORTUNE Saturday, January 20, 2018 Credit: Justin Tallis\u2014AFP\/Getty Images comments \nFacebook and Twitter both revealed on Friday more about how they plan to deal with the spread of fake news and propaganda on their services. \nFacebook said that it would ask its users to tell it which news sources they read and trust to help it decide which ones should be featured more prominently. These responses will help \u201cshift the balance of news you see towards sources that are determined to be trusted by the community,\u201d CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained in a Facebook post. \nMeanwhile, Twitter said in a blog post that it would email nearly 678,000 users that may have inadvertently interacted with now-suspended accounts believed to have been linked to a Russian propaganda outfit called the Internet Research Agency (IRA). \nThe announcements come amid intense scrutiny by U.S. lawmakers over both Facebook and Twitter\u2019s role in letting Russians and others spread misinformation during the 2016 presidential election. The goal, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, was to divide Americans on politically charged issues like race, religion, and gun control. \nZuckerberg announced the Facebook news just days after his company said it would revamp its news feed to show users more family-friendly posts from friends or acquaintances that Facebook believes will spur more user interaction. \n\u201cThere\u2019s too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarization in the world today,\u201d Zuckerberg said about the polling of users about the sites they have confidence in. \u201cSocial media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don\u2019t specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them.\u201d \nHe added: \u201cThis update will not change the amount of news you see on Facebook. It will only shift the balance of news you see towards sources that are determined to be trusted by the community.\u201d \nIt\u2019s unclear how Facebook\u2019s shift will solve the problem of so-called filter bubbles, in which people only see information that aligns with their existing beliefs. Some raised the possibility that crowd sourcing the list of credible news outlets could be manipulated. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. \nFor its part, Twitter minimized the impact of the Russian-linked accounts, saying that they merely represented \u201ctwo one-hundredths of a percent (0.016%) of the total accounts on Twitter at the time.\u201d \n\u201cHowever, any such activity represents a challenge to democratic societies everywhere, and we\u2019re committed to continuing to work on this important issue,\u201d Twitter said. \nTwitter has said that it had discovered 3,814 IRA-connected accounts in total, including 1,062 accounts that it uncovered just recently. It said it had also identified 50,258 bot accounts linked to the Russian government that spread misinformation during the 2016 election, including 13,512 accounts found just recently.

{"published":"2018-01-08T23:48:00.000+02:00","title":"Bond markets look beyond easy ECB money to first rate rise","text":"LONDON (Reuters) - The timing of a European Central Bank rate rise is fast taking over as the main driver of borrowing costs in the euro area as investors begin to sense that the bank\u2019s massive stimulus scheme may end sooner rather than later.\nWhen the ECB said it would halve monthly bond purchases to 30 billion euros ($36 billion) from Jan. 1 but keep the scheme until Sept. 30, there was an expectation its asset buying would only be wound down gradually thereafter over a period of months.\nGiven the ECB has said rates would remain unchanged until \u201cwell past\u201d the program had ended once and for all, many investors assumed interest rates would stay on hold at least until late 2019.\nBut in the past two weeks, some ECB officials have suggested the 2.55 trillion euro asset-purchase program could end altogether in September - potentially bringing forward the timing of the bank\u2019s first rate rise since 2011.\nAccording to money market pricing EUROIS, investors have brought forward expectations of an increase by about six months to early 2019, suggesting a rate rise could come well before Mario Draghi\u2019s term as ECB chief ends in October next year.\nYields on short-dated bonds, the most sensitive to changes in interest rates, have also started to move higher, indicating that expectations of tighter monetary policy are starting to outweigh the impact of so-called quantitative easing (QE).\nFive-year bond yields in Germany, the euro zone\u2019s biggest economy, rose 10 basis points in December DE5YT=RR, the biggest monthly jump in six. Two-year German bond yields are near five-month highs at minus 0.62 percent DE2YT=RR while 10-year bond yields hit two-month highs last week DE10YT=RR.\n\u201cRight now long-term rates are determined by the timing of a first rate hike rather than the flow of QE,\u201d said Peter Chatwell, head of rates strategy at Mizuho in London.\nANTICIPATING THE END At the start of December, euro zone government bond yields were near multi-month lows, even though some asset managers said they should be higher given the reduction in bond buying to come and the risk of tighter monetary policy.\nAnalysts say the market shift came after comments from the ECB\u2019s Benoit Coeure and Ewald Nowotny. Coeure, the man in charge of the bank\u2019s asset-buying program, said on Dec. 30 there was a reasonable chance it would not be extended.\nNowotny said in an interview published on Jan. 2 that QE could end in 2018 if the euro zone economy continues to grow strongly and on Sunday, the Bundesbank\u2019s Jens Weidmann said the ECB should set a date to end QE.\nThe ECB\u2019s \u201cforward guidance\u201d on rates staying low for the foreseeable future has been credited with capping medium-term borrowing costs for governments and firms alike and is one policy tool the bank can use after QE ends.\nBut that guidance, and its ability to anchor borrowing costs, could be put to the test if the euro zone economy continues its strong expansion, inflation creeps up and markets sense a rate rise may be coming sooner rather than later.\nCentral bankers know that preparing the ground for a withdrawal of stimulus is crucial. In May 2013, then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke sent global bond markets into a tailspin by suggesting the U.S. central bank\u2019s bond buying could be reduced - an event known as the \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d.\n\u201cRate hikes are not a 2018 story but even the mention of that means that markets are very unprepared,\u201d said Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy for EMEA at State Street Global Markets.\n\u201cMarkets are going to be increasingly watching any signs of when rates may rise beyond the tapering news flow which has broadly been factored in,\u201d he said.\nCORE INFLATION Money market prices suggests investors have in recent weeks bought forward their expectations for the first rate rise by about six months, closer to March 2019.\nThe difference between the overnight bank-to-bank interest rate for the euro zone (Eonia) and forward Eonia rates is about 5 to 6 basis points in 18 months\u2019 time.\nAnalysts say that means investors are pricing in a 50-60 percent chance of a 10 bps increase in the ECB\u2019s deposit rate - the minimum it is likely to increase - from minus 0.4 percent.\nING senior bond analyst Martin van Vliet said the earliest occasion for the ECB to provide some clarity on the outlook for interest would be June, given it only announced the reduction to its QE program in October.\n\u201cIt is definitely going to be a year where the QE premium is priced out,\u201d he said.\nThe switch in focus to the timing of an ECB rate rise also means inflation data could have a greater impact on markets than in recent years, analysts said.\nInflation in the euro zone remains stubbornly low at 1.4 percent - or just 1.1 percent when volatile food and energy prices are stripped out - well below the ECB\u2019s target of an inflation rate of nearly 2 percent.\nYet purchasing managers surveys showed that the euro zone economy ended 2017 with its strongest growth in seven years, driven by accelerating services and manufacturing activity across all major economies.\n\u201cThis year will be all about core inflation, core inflation, core inflation,\u201d said Frederik Ducrozet, senior economist at Pictet Wealth Management in Geneva.\n($1 = 0.8356 euros)\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; additional reporting by Saikat Chatterjee; editing by David Clarke\n "}
