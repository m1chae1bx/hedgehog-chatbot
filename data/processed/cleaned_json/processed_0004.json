{"published":"2018-01-04T18:04:00.000+02:00","title":"Self-driving start-up takes on the giants with self-taught algorithms","text":"Before the car can drive without a human, one must first get behind the wheel.\nAs the driver accelerates, stops and turns on local streets, sensors on the car record what he sees and track how he responds. Then a team of engineers builds software that can learn how to behave from that data.\nThe software is installed in the car, and it can drive on its own. In the end, the car mimics choices made by the human driver.\nThis is how things work at Aurora Innovation, a start-up founded by three veterans of autonomous vehicle research, including Chris Urmson, who previously led the self-driving car project at Google.\nThe company\u2019s methods are part of a change sweeping across the world of self-driving cars: a kind of so-called machine learning technology that promises a chance for little companies like Aurora to compete with the giants of both the tech and automotive industries. With it, researchers can build and improve autonomous vehicles at a far more rapid pace \u2014 one of the reasons Aurora believes it can close the gap on companies that have been working on self-driving technology for years.\nOn Thursday, the year-old start-up said that it had agreed to supply self-driving technology to the Volkswagen Group and Hyundai, two of the world\u2019s largest car companies. Johann Jungwirth, the chief digital officer at the Volkswagen Group, which owns Audi, Porsche, and six other major automotive brands including the flagship VW brand, said the company has been working with Aurora for several months, with an eye toward developing both autonomous cars and driverless taxi services.\nIn 2010, when Mr. Urmson and his colleagues at Google launched the autonomous vehicle movement , writing the computer code to guide their vehicles was a painstaking, line-by-line effort. But in recent years, a type of computer algorithm called a deep neural network has come in from the edges of academia to reinvent the way many technologies are built , including autonomous vehicles.\nThese algorithms can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data. \u201cIt used to be that a real smart Ph.D. sat in a cube for six months, and they would hand-code a detector\u201d that spotted objects on the road, Mr. Urmson said during a recent interview at Aurora\u2019s offices. \u201cNow, you gather the right kind of data and feed it to an algorithm, and a day later, you have something that works as well as that six months of work from the Ph.D.\u201d\nThe Google self-driving car project first used the technique to detect pedestrians. Since then, it has applied the same method to many other parts of the car, including systems that predict what will happen on the road and plan a route forward. Now, the industry as a whole is moving in the same direction.\nBut this shift raises questions. It is still unclear how regulators and lawyers \u2014 not to mention the general public \u2014 will view these methods. Because neural networks learn from such large amounts of data, relying on hours or even days of calculations, they operate in ways that their human designers cannot necessarily anticipate or understand. There is no means of determining exactly why a machine reaches a particular decision.\n\u201cThis is a big transition,\u201d said Noah Goodhall, who explores regulatory and legal issues surrounding autonomous cars at the Virginia Transportation Research Council, an arm of the state Department of Transportation. \u201cIf you start using neural networks to control how a car moves and then it crashes, how do you explain why it crashed and why it won\u2019t happen again?\u201d\nThe seeds for this work were planted in 2012. Working with two other researchers at the University of Toronto, a graduate student named Alex Krizhevsky built a neural network that could recognize photos of everyday objects like flowers, dogs and cars . By analyzing thousands of flower photos, it could learn to recognize a flower in a matter of days. And it performed better than any system coded by hand.\nSoon, Mr. Krizhevsky and his collaborators moved to Google, and over the next few years, Google and its internet rivals broke new ground in artificial intelligence, using these concepts to identify objects in photos and to recognize commands spoken into smartphones, translate between languages, and respond to internet search queries.\nOver the holiday break at the end of 2013, another Google researcher, Anelia Angelova, asked for Mr. Krizhevsky\u2019s help on the Google car project. Neither of them officially worked on the project. They were part of a separate A.I. lab called Google Brain. But they saw an opportunity.\nRather than trying to define for a computer what a pedestrian looked like, they created an algorithm that could allow a computer to learn what a pedestrian looked like. By analyzing thousands of street photos, their system could begin to identify the visual patterns that define a pedestrian, like the curve of a head or the bend of a leg. The method was so effective that Google began applying the technique to other parts of the project, including prediction and planning.\n\u201cIt was a big turning point,\u201d said Dmitri Dolgov, who was part of Google\u2019s original self-driving car team and is now chief technology officer at Waymo, the new company that oversees the project. \u201c2013 was pretty magical.\u201d\nMr. Urmson described this shift in much the same way. He believes the continued progress of these and other machine learning methods will be essential to building cars that can match and even exceed the behavior of human drivers.\nMore from The New York Times: \nThe Big Tech Trends to Follow at CES 2018 \nResearchers Discover Two Major Flaws in the World's Computers \nExpect 2018 to Be More Sane? Sorry, It's Not Going to Happen \nMirroring the work at Waymo, Aurora is building algorithms that can recognize objects on the road and anticipate and react to what other vehicles and pedestrians will do next. As Mr. Urmson explained, the software can learn what happens when a driver turns the vehicle in a particular direction at a particular speed on a particular type of road.\nLearning from human drivers in this way is an evolution of an old idea. In the early 1990s, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University built a car that learned relatively simple behavior. Last year, a team of researchers at Nvidia, the computer chip maker, published a paper showing how modern hardware can extend the idea to more complex behavior. But many researchers question whether carmakers can completely understand why neural networks make particular decisions and rule out unexpected behavior.\n\u201cFor cars or flying aircraft, there is a lot of concern over neural networks doing crazy things,\u201d said Mykel Kochenderfer, a robotics professor who oversees the Intelligent Systems Laboratory at Stanford University.\nSome researchers, for instance, have shown that neural networks trained to identify objects can be fooled into seeing things that aren\u2019t there \u2014 though many, including Mr. Kochenderfer, are working to develop ways of identifying and preventing unexpected behavior.\nLike Waymo, Toyo"}

{"published":"2018-01-05T14:00:00.000+02:00","title":"Greenbrier Reports First Quarter Results","text":"LAKE OSWEGO, Ore., Jan. 5, The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. (NYSE: GBX) today reported financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2017.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nNet earnings attributable to Greenbrier for the quarter were $26.3 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, on revenue of $559.5 million. Quarterly results included $3.4 million ($2.3 million after-tax or $0.07 per diluted share) of expense related to resolution of litigation in a foreign jurisdiction. Additionally, the tax rate for the quarter was 33.3% attributable to discrete items and the geographic mix of earnings. Compared to the previous annual tax rate guidance of 29%, the impact of the higher quarterly rate is $0.07 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $76.9 million, or 13.7% of revenue. Orders for 3,200 diversified railcars were received during this quarter, valued at over $290 million. New railcar backlog as of November 30, 2017 was 26,500 units with an estimated value of $2.56 billion. New railcar deliveries totaled 4,400 units for the quarter. Board declares a quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share, payable on February 16, 2018 to shareholders as of January 26, 2018.\nWilliam A. Furman, Chairman and CEO, said, \"Greenbrier advanced several key initiatives during the quarter and is on track to achieve our goals for the year. While the new railcar market in North America is challenging, broad-based demand for Greenbrier's products and services remains steady and we expect will trend higher as we advance through fiscal 2018. During the recent quarter, Greenbrier received 3,200 orders for a broad range of railcar types including covered hoppers, tanks, automotive carrying units and our first orders for open top hoppers for use in aggregate service. Greenbrier's disciplined balance sheet management has resulted in a strong cash position and very low net debt, enabling us to invest strategically and return capital to shareholders. Good backlog visibility combined with a strong balance sheet provides the flexibility we need to build railcars when and where customers need them, across four continents.\"\nFurman concluded, \"Based on first quarter results, we are confident in our guidance for the year. As fiscal 2018 progresses, we will continue integration of our new manufacturing investments and will continue to expand internationally. Greenbrier is well positioned to achieve its ambitious business objectives for fiscal 2018 as growth in North American and international markets drives increased revenues, deliveries and EPS compared to fiscal 2017.\"\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on current business trends, industry forecasts and production schedules for fiscal 2018, and excluding the expected benefits of the recent tax reform act, Greenbrier believes:\nDeliveries will be approximately 20,000 \u2013 22,000 units including Greenbrier-Maxion (Brazil) which will account for up to 10% of deliveries Revenue will be $2.4 \u2013 $2.6 billion Diluted EPS will be $4.00\nAs noted in the \"Safe Harbor\" statement, there are risks to achieving this guidance.

REUTERS\/Antoni Slodkowski\/File Photo \nThe Reuters journalists, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were detained on Dec. 12. They are being investigated on suspicion of breaching the Official Secrets Act, a little-used law that dates from the days of British colonial rule. \nThey had worked on coverage of a crisis in the western state of Rakhine, where a military crackdown that followed militant attacks on security forces in August led to an exodus of more than 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to refugee camps in Bangladesh. \nThe two are due to appear in court on Wednesday. It will be their second appearance in court and the prosecutor could request that charges are filed against them. \n\u201cThis situation amounts to a serious intimidation against journalists in general and from Reuters in particular,\u201d said Kristian Schmidt, representative in Yangon of the EU\u2019s 28 states, said in the letter dated Jan. 8. \n\u201cJournalists should ... be able to work in a free and enabling environment without fear of intimidation or undue arrest or prosecution,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWe therefore call on your government to provide the necessary legal protection for these two journalists, to ensure the full respect of their fundamental rights and to release them immediately.\u201d \nWa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were detained after they were invited to meet police for dinner in Yangon. \nThe Ministry of Information has cited the police as saying they were \u201carrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces\u201d. It said they had \u201cillegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media\u201d. \nGovernment officials from some of the world\u2019s major nations, including the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have called for their release. \nReuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J. Adler has called for the immediate release of the two. \n\u201cAs they near their hearing date, it remains entirely clear that they are innocent of any wrongdoing,\u201d Adler said in a statement on Monday. \nAuthorities have blocked access to media seeking to cover the military crackdown in the north of Rakhine State.

Both airlines told the news organization that it would help their staff help customers. \nThe carriers previously had an agreement that achieved much the same thing, but that ended in 2015 after Delta complained it was having to deal with more American Airlines passengers than vice versa. \nHowever, that was an interline agreement, allowing passengers to combine flights with both airlines in a single itinerary\u2014this time round, the carriers aren\u2019t going as far.

Elaine Lies 4 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - To quad or not to quad would not even be a question for any man aiming for the podium at this year\u2019s Olympics, as more of the complicated jumps fill routines and bring in the points. FILE PHOTO: Figure Ice Skating - ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final - Men Free Skating - Nagoya, Japan - December 8, 2017. Nathan Chen of the U.S is seen in action. REUTERS\/Issei Kato\/File Photo \nBut how far the sport - and skaters\u2019 bodies - will go in pursuit of the jumps, which require four complete revolutions before landing, is unknown. \nAt the recent Grand Prix Final in Japan, Nathan Chen, who has steadily racked up jumping records this year, including landing seven clean quads at the U.S. Championships this past spring, won the men\u2019s competition with tries for at least five quads in his free skate. \nHot on his heels was Japan\u2019s Shoma Uno, the first skater to successfully land a quad flip in international competition, who ultimately won the free part of the competition with a quad-filled programme but trailed Chen overall by half a point. \nBut both cleanly landed only a few of the quads, prompting questions about whether it was not smarter to lower the level of their programmes in the interest of success. \n\u201cIf you keep on putting quads into a programme, it does kind of put your stability at risk,\u201d Uno told a news conference. \n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to show the crowds perfection, I want to show them that I\u2019m growing as a skater. So I\u2019ll go on with the challenging routines.\u201d \nQuad jumps have a 30-year history in competition, dating from Canada\u2019s Kurt Browning, who in 1988 became the first person to land a legal quadruple jump - a quad toeloop. \nSince then, five different varieties of the high-risk jump have become such an essential part of men\u2019s skating that no man has won Olympic gold quadlessly since 1994 - with one exception. \nThat was U.S. skater Evan Lysacek, who at the 2010 Vancouver Games defeated Russian defending champion Yevgeny Plushenko who said Lysacek had danced \u201crather than skating like a man.\u201d \nNot everyone loves the trend towards athleticism required by the jumps. FILE PHOTO: Figure Skating - ISU World Team Trophy - Men's Free Program - Tokyo, Japan - 21\/4\/17 - Nathan Chen of U.S. competes. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon\/File Photo \nTwo-time U.S. Olympian Johnny Weir, who confessed that when he was competing quads were his \u201cnemesis,\u201d said he felt emphasis on the jumps - which command high points, especially in the second half of any programme - has perhaps gone too far. \n\u201cIt isn\u2019t as enjoyable to watch as it was from our era,\u201d Weir told Reuters in a telephone interview. \u201cNow it seems skaters will try to do quads that they aren\u2019t comfortable with because of the points.\u201d \nDefending Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu and Spain\u2019s Javier Fernandez, both of whom can land jumps and are beautiful skaters, have achieved a good balance of athleticism and artistry, he added, whereas quads tend to be \u201ctechnique, mathematics and body type.\u201d \nPatrick Chan, who at 27 is one of the older skaters on the circuit and came second to Hanyu in Sochi, has also expressed reservations. \n\u201cNathan\u2019s trump card is the quads, mine is a little more understated,\u201d he told Reuters in Toronto. \u201cFor me, it is the fact I have more experience. \u201d \nAnd the women may follow, though so far only retired Japanese skater Miki Ando has landed a quad in competition, at the junior level and back in 2002. \n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that the younger generation has started to actively study these jumps,\u201d Evgenia Medvedeva, who will be the gold medal favourite if she is able to compete at the Games, said at a Moscow news conference after a Grand Prix event. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s the next step of figure skating.\u201d \nThere is talk about possibly limiting the number of quads, but skaters oppose the idea. Russia\u2019s Mikhail Kolyada, who took bronze at the Grand Prix Final, said the jumps are important to add energy to routines, which attracts audiences. \nBut rather than capping the number of quads, perhaps more points should be given for other elements, U.S. Olympian Adam Rippon told Reuters. \n\u201cI think if you made different point opportunities, you\u2019d see different skaters come forward so it\u2019s not just that a sloppy programme with quads always wins,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt would be different skaters bringing different parts of skating. It\u2019s not just jumps.\u201d Additional reporting by Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber in MOSCOW and Steve Keating in TORONTO, writing by Elaine Lies; editing by Amlan Chakraborty"}

One option was a sale of the business, it said. \nLifeScan makes devices to monitor blood glucose levels, which are key to controlling diabetes. Animas and Calibras -- which J&J acquired in 2012 -- make insulin delivery devices. In October, Animas, which makes insulin pumps, said it would shut its business in the United States and Canada amid increased competition and after failing to find a buyer. \nChinese interest in the J&J unit comes as the market for diabetes care in China is expected to grow rapidly. Almost one in three of the world's diabetes sufferers lives in China, according to World Health Organisation estimates. \nAmong the potential bidders is a consortium being formed by Shenzhen-listed Sinocare, which develops and manufactures blood sugar monitoring systems, and China Jianyin Investment (JIC), a unit of sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp. The group has hired an advisor to work on a bid, according to two sources. \n\"The evaluation of potential strategic options for LifeScan and Calibra Medical Inc. is ongoing and we do not have an announcement regarding these businesses at this time,\" J&J said in a statement in response to Reuters request for comment. \nThe company has hired Goldman Sachs to work on the sale, according to three of the people. The bank declined to comment. \nSinocare's investors relations office said it could not confirm the information when contacted by Reuters. JIC and CIC did not respond to requests for comment. The sources declined to be identified. \nAsia accounts for more than 60 percent of global diabetes cases, with increasing levels of wealth, unhealthy diets and more sedentary lifestyles sparking \"diabetes epidemics\" in the region, according to BMI Research. \nGeorge Lin, chief financial officer of Hua Medicine, a diabetes-focused drug developer, told Reuters on Wednesday that according to the most recent market research there were more than 110 million diabetes patients in China alone. \n\"The market right now in the world is already close to $50 billion,\" he said, referring to diabetes drugs. \"In China, it is expected to grow from $6.6 billion in 2016 to $20 billion by 2025. This is a very large, fast-growing market.\" \nLin left a senior role at Bank of America Merrill Lynch to join Hua in December. \nIt is not yet clear if potential Chinese buyers are interested in the whole of J&J's diabetes care business or one or more of the member companies. \nSinocare, which has a market capitalisation of about $1.8 billion, in 2015 teamed up with Citic Securities to bid for Bayer's diabetes devices business that was eventually sold to Japan's Panasonic Healthcare Holdings, majority-owned by U.S. investment firm KKR. \nJIC, wholly owned by CIC, mainly invests in the industrial manufacturing, consumption and information technology sectors, according to its website. \nCIC's vice-chairman and president, Tu Guangshao, said at a panel discussion during the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong this week that it would look for more investment opportunities in the healthcare industry. \nThe sale of the diabetes business has also attracted interest from global private equity players, according to the people with knowledge of the process. But analysts said China could offer a tonic to J&J's struggling diabetes care unit and a turnaround opportunity for regional investors. Revenues at J&J's diabetes care unit have been falling since 2012, a Reuters study of the company's financial results found. In the first nine months of 2017, sales slid 7.7 percent year-on-year. In 2016, it suffered a similar decline. \nAny sale by J&J of its diabetes device units would fit with a drive to exit from lower-margin, commoditized categories such as glucose meters and strips, but analysts said Asian buyers may be able to squeeze more out of the assets. \n\"Could a Chinese company extract more value from this than a multinational? It's possible because they have different expectations of profitability than multinationals so they can be happy with lower margins,\" said Franck Le Deu, Hong Kong-based senior partner at consultancy McKinsey. \n\"One complication of being in diabetes for a Chinese company is that you need a broad portfolio to be able to compete, and a broad footprint because it's a very dispersed market,\" he added. \"So the investment levels needed to be competitive in diabetes are quite high, it's not an easy game to play.\" Related Securities "}

Sunni volunteers, who have joined the Abbas Fighting Division, take part in a field training in Kerbala, Iraq December 20, 2017. Picture taken December 20, 2017. REUTERS\/Thaier Al-Sudani \nThe task will not be easy. The paramilitaries, or Popular Mobilisation Forces, are mostly trained and backed by Iran, so Abadi risks angering his most powerful regional backer. \nIraq\u2019s Shi\u2018ite majority also see the PMF\u2019s 150,000 fighters as their saviours. Several militia commanders plan to run against Abadi in parliamentary elections in May and some have warned they will resist attempts to dismantle them. \nAbadi\u2019s plan envisages taking back the militias\u2019 heavy weapons and cutting their strength by half, according to military and intelligence sources. \nThe army is already taking an inventory of PMF weaponry, such as the armoured vehicles and tanks the government gave them to fight Islamic State. \nNext, Abadi will order his military and police commanders to take back those heavy weapons under the pretext of repairing them. The defence ministry will then remove over-age or physically unfit fighters, two military sources said. \n\u201cThe plan will be implemented with extreme caution and precision in order to prevent a negative backlash from the PMF commanders,\u201d said an army colonel who was briefed on it by his commander. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep a second army within one state; this is the key objective of the plan.\u201d \nThe plan will be closely followed by Iran and the United States. The groups are one of Iran\u2019s many levers of influence in Iraq, while for Washington they are a reminder of Tehran\u2019s growing reach in the Middle East. \nLawmakers close to Abadi and one of his political advisers say he is coming under \u201ctremendous pressure\u201d from the West and Sunni regional allies to dissolve the PMF now that Islamic State, or Daesh, is no longer a major threat. \n\u201cPrime Minister Abadi is getting messages from allies in the war against Daesh encouraging him to dismantle the PMF as a condition to keeping their support flowing in future,\u201d the adviser said on condition of anonymity. \nIn a phone call last month, French President Emmanuel Macron encouraged Abadi to dismantle the PMF, said the adviser, who was briefed on the call. \nWith Islamic State crushed in Iraq, Abadi will find it harder to avoid clamping down on the militia, according to a lawmaker from his Dawa Party. \n\u201cAbadi would respond to pressure from his Western and Gulf allies to dissolve the PMF by saying he needs them to fight Daesh, but now Daesh is finished and there are no more excuses to keep the PMF,\u201d the lawmaker said. \nIn any case Abadi does not trust the Iranians, whose militia allies act like a state within a state, said a Shi\u2018ite lawmaker close to the prime minister. \n\u201cAbadi sees the support of the West, the United States and regional Arab states as indispensable in making Iraq more stable in future,\u201d the lawmaker said. \nBut militia commanders, such as Ali al-Hussaini from the Imam Ali Brigades, say the PMF played a major part in defeating Islamic State and dismantling them would be a \u201cbig mistake\u201d. \n\u201cWe have millions of followers who will defend our rights against any attempt to target us,\u201d he said. \nNonetheless, a joint committee from the army, police, and intelligence services will review the number of PMF fighters and make recommendations to Abadi, who will decide who will stay and who will be retired, said a military intelligence colonel who is close to the military chief of staff\u2019s office. \nAbadi would also order his commanders to restructure their own forces. \nAnother army colonel said taking heavy weapons from the militias would not be easy, as they control hundreds of headquarters, arms stockpiles, camps, and even small rocket factories. IRANIAN INFLUENCE \nDisarming the militias is one of Abadi\u2019s most delicate challenges. They are generally more effective than the Iraqi security forces and often defy Baghdad with the support of Tehran. Sunni volunteers, who have joined the Abbas Fighting Division, take part in a field training in Kerbala, Iraq December 20, 2017. REUTERS\/Thaier Al-Sudani \nThey also have the blessing of Iraq\u2019s most influential Shi\u2018ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. \nIraqi Shi\u2018ite militia commanders are openly loyal to Tehran, Iranian advisers are seen on Iraqi battlefields, and Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Abadi in June against weakening the militias. \nThe PMF gained prominence after Sistani called on Iraqis to take up arms against Islamic State when it seized a third of the country in 2014. \nSince then the militias have become more assertive, riding around cities in vehicles flying their own flags. They are accused of terrorising minority Sunnis, which they deny. \nSecurity sources and analysts say any attempt by Abadi to muzzle the PMF could invite a backlash from Shi\u2018ites, who expect the militias to protect them in the event of renewed sectarian conflict in Iraq. \nAny backlash could lead to the election of an alliance of Iranian-backed political parties to enough seats in parliament to end Abadi\u2019s bid for a second term. \nAbadi\u2019s success against Islamic State and in quashing a Kurdish bid for independence in Iraq may tempt him into over-confidence in acting against the militias, said Jasim al-Bahadli, a Baghdad-based expert on Shi\u2018ite armed groups. Slideshow (10 Images) \n\u201cPlaying hard with the PMF could be a double-edged sword; they have broad popularity that Abadi should not underestimate.\u201d FIERY CLERIC \nTo counter the PMF\u2019s popularity, Abadi has turned to the cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who once led an armed rebellion against U.S. occupation forces and was named the most dangerous man in Iraq by the Pentagon. \nThe pair held a secret meeting in the holy Shi\u2018ite city of Karbala on Nov. 11 to discuss Sadr helping the government disarm the militias, according to aides for both men who attended the meeting. \nSadr sees the militias as a threat to his role as a kingmaker in Iraq\u2019s turbulent politics. \nDuring their meeting, Abadi asked Sadr to support him in his bid to \u201ccleanse the country\u201d of corrupt politicians and those who might try to use armed groups to influence the election, an adviser to Sadr said. \n\u201cThey talked about putting an end to the militias operating above the law, fighting corruption, and of course supporting Abadi\u2019s bid to be prime minister for a second term,\u201d he said. \nSeveral lawmakers close to Abadi and sources close to Sadr said the prime minister had secured the cleric\u2019s support to stop the PMF interfering in the election. \n\u201cSadr can put hundreds of thousands on the streets in solidarity with Abadi with one call, he would make Abadi\u2019s opponents think twice before challenging him,\u201d said a senior Shi\u2018ite politician close to Sadr. \nIndeed, Sadr plans to do just that in the very near future, another source close to him said. STRONG CHALLENGER \nSources close to Sadr said he also promised to persuade Sistani to support Abadi\u2019s plans to restrain the militias. \nThat could give Abadi an edge over the militias, which comprise more than 66 groups, over 40 of which are backed by Iran, accord"}

FILE PHOTO: Bob de Jong of the Netherlands reacts after the men's 5000m event at the ISU World Cup speed skating competition in Heerenveen, the Netherlands December 13, 2014. REUTERS\/Michael Kooren\/File Photo \nA long-distance specialist with four Olympic medals including gold in the 10,000m in Turin in 2006, De Jong arrived in the country last May to help train their skaters. \nThe Koreans are better known for their prowess in short track, but the Dutchman is bringing his vast experience to bear on honing their technique over the longer distances. \nSouth Korea sprang a surprise when they won five medals on the long track in Vancouver, with the country finishing with 14 medals in total in 2010, their best haul at a Winter Games. \nThe hosts are targeting a total of 20 medals at next month\u2019s Games, but De Jong is just focussing on getting the best out of his skaters. \n\u201dThey\u2019ve got a longer short track history,\u201c he told Reuters from Seoul. \u201dFour years ago (in Sochi) they got two medals (on the long track) so it was not that good, and even in the coming Olympics it\u2019ll be really hard to get medals. \n\u201cI know the international level, it\u2019s higher. I don\u2019t want to talk about a target of how many medals we can take. First focus on good skating, even I did that in my own career.\u201d \nMost of the skaters De Jong is working with have converted from short track and the seven-times world champion explained how they have had to unlearn years of training in a different technique to prepare for the longer runs. \n\u201dI\u2018m not a transfer coach. They\u2019re already long track skaters,\u201c he said. \u201dBut you can see on the long track they have the background of short track skaters. \n\u201cThe most important part is using your bodyweight in the straights and that\u2019s kind of new for the short track skaters because they are not (used to) skating straights.\u201d LANGUAGE BARRIER \nDe Jong is also teaching the Koreans how to conserve energy while cornering.

Mandatory Credit: Jim Urquhart-USA TODAY Sports\/File Photo \n\u201cIn the short track, the corners are four steps and you really slow down in rhythm, but for long track you need a higher rhythm,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThey\u2019re so comfortable with the low rhythm in the corners, but if you do that in the long track, your legs will be blowing up.\u201d \nDe Jong said Olympic records could fall in Gangneung and is pushing his skaters to get as close to those times as possible to give them their best shot at a medal. \n\u201cA couple of skaters, they are really close (to the Olympic records),\u201d he said. \u201cLee Seung-hoon is absolutely one of the biggest skaters here in Korea and he\u2019s in good shape to make a good performance.\u201d \nLee, who took gold in the 10,000m at the Vancouver Games ahead of Ivan Skobrev and De Jong himself, could race in the mass start, 1,500m, 5,000m, 10,000m, and team pursuit. \n\u201cThe team pursuit with the three skaters are getting really good times,\u201d De Jong said. \u201cOne of the men\u2019s teams was really close to breaking the world record this year already.\u201d \nLee Sang-Hwa and Kim Min-sun are carrying the country\u2019s medal hopes in the women\u2019s 500m, while Kim Bo-reum could challenge in the mass start and 1,500m. \nLanguage is biggest barrier De Jong has faced in South Korea and while he is loving his time in the country, the 41-year-old is also having to adapt to the culture. \n\u201dFor me the language is really hard,\u201c he said. \u201dI\u2019ve got my translator in the team, the video analyst is also translating a lot of things for me, but the biggest thing is body language. \n\u201dI think to explain the technique it\u2019s quite easy to do it by body language. \n\u201dIt\u2019s such a big difference in culture. In Korea they have a lot of respect. Sometimes the skaters have to tell me more information about how they feel, what they think about the training, but in their culture it\u2019s not normal to tell. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not about good or bad. It\u2019s a culture thing. I don\u2019t want to change it and I can\u2018t. It\u2019s impossible to change a culture.\u201d Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford"}

He was the creator of the critically acclaimed CBS sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond which aired for 9 seasons and won more than 70 Emmys.\nRosenthal's new show Somebody Feed Phil, available on Netflix, said the idea came from Ray Romano's real-life lack of interest in travel.\n\"It started on Raymond, it started when we went to Italy with the show,\" Rosenthal told CNBC's On the Money in an interview.\n\"Ray had never been to Europe ,\" he added.\nNot only that, but Rosenthal said Romano didn't really want to go. However, Romano's perspective changed after filming the episode in Italy.\n\"That's when the light bulb went off, because I got such a high seeing it happen to him, I thought what if I can do this for other people?\"\nSomebody Feed Phil showcases 6 cities: Bangkok, Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Mexico City, Saigon, and New Orleans where he eats an assortment of food from high-end restaurants to street vendors.\nOne of the chefs featured is Jay Fai, a street vendor in Bangkok, who prepared a crab omelet that Rosenthal deemed \"one of the best things you'll ever eat.\"\nAnd he's not alone in his opinion. After filming the episode, Fai earned a Michelin star , the first ever in Bangkok. \nSo how does Rosenthal pick which cities to feature?\nHe said he wants to start with \"Earth's greatest hits, the best, most accessible places to go.\"\nBangkok may not seem like an obvious choice to many, but Rosenthal disagreed.\n\"Everyone speaks English, it's a big modern city, all the conveniences, you're going to have a hotel, you're going to have a bed\u2026the food is unbelievable,\" Rosenthal explained.\nIn his New Orleans episode, Rosenthal says you'll see beignets, jambalaya, as well as a few unexpected surprises such as an Israeli restaurant called Shaya, as well as a \"veggie reuben\" made with collard greens instead of meat.\nThis isn't Rosenthal's first travel show. I'll Have What Phil's Having was produced by PBS and ran in 2015. But according to the Hollywood Reporter, the show was too expensive to make . \nNetflix , which is spending billions on original content , picked up the show under a new title.\nOn working with Netflix, Rosenthal said the company gives him a lot of creative freedom.\nHe added, \"You don't worry about competition because it's like you go into a store, and everything's there on the shelf for you.

We will fight for the rule of law, fight for Hong Kong, fight for the future, fight for the next generations.\u201d \nTwo protesters who dressed up as People\u2019s Liberation Army soldiers said they were concerned about the reach of China\u2019s security apparatus. Others called for full democracy as the only lasting means to safeguard the city\u2019s way of life. \nThe organisers of the march said some 10,000 people had showed up. Police, however, put the figure at 6,200. Slideshow (7 Images) \nThe demonstration was largely peaceful, though some protesters who tried to later gather in a forecourt of the government\u2019s headquarters skirmished briefly with security guards. \nThe so-called \u201cCivic Square\u201d was where the 2014 pro-democracy protests first kicked off when a group of protesters stormed over a fence and faced off with local police. \nDespite the defiance on show, some said they feared Hong Kong would continue to be squeezed by Beijing. \n\u201cEveryone\u2019s doing what they can,\u201d said Andy Lau who was among the marchers. \u201cIf we have the right to demonstrate then we should. But I\u2018m not feeling positive. I think things will get worse.\u201d \nThe Hong Kong government, in a statement, said it \u201cfully respects the right of Hong Kong people to take part in processions and their freedom of expression\u201d. \nChina\u2019s leader Xi Jinping has said that while Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy under \u201cone country, two systems\u201d, Beijing still holds supreme authority over the city and won\u2019t tolerate any challenge to its authority.

This expanded applicability of our DiePak carriers could significantly expand our market for highly parallel bare die test and burn-in of devices where safety, security, or consumer confidence is critical.\n\u201cSo far this fiscal year, we have received additional orders from our two lead customers for FOX-XP systems for additional capacity and capability to address new devices. We continue to be very happy with our relationship and partnership with both of these customers and their subcontractors \/ suppliers. We are also actively engaged with several additional opportunities related to our FOX-XP and FOX-1P wafer level and singulated die \/ module test and burn in systems, and we are seeing good traction with these potential new customers. This added visibility adds to our confidence that we can continue to add new customers and applications to our FOX-P family of products going forward.\n\u201cWe continue to maintain our confidence in our revenue growth forecast for this fiscal year, and reiterate our previously provided financial guidance for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2018 of full year total revenue growth of at least 50% over fiscal 2017 and to be profitable for the year. With nearly $15 million in revenue on the books for the first half of the fiscal year, a healthy backlog of $12.2 million at the end our fiscal first half, and the additional orders announced since the start of our second half, we believe we are well positioned to achieve this expectation.\u201d\nManagement Conference Call and Webcast\nAehr Test Systems will host a conference call and webcast today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (2:00 p.m. PT) to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2018 operating results.

And the problem is a key factor driving soybean buyers from the U.S. to Brazil, where warmer weather helps offset the impact of higher crop yields on protein levels. \nA decade ago, the United States supplied 38 percent of soybeans to China, the world's top importer, compared to 34 percent from Brazil. Now, Brazil supplies 57 percent of Chinese imports compared to 31 from the United States, according to China's General Administration of Customs. \nSoybeans are by far the most valuable U.S. agricultural export, with $22.8 billion in shipments in 2016. Declining protein levels and market share pose another vexing problem for soy farmers already reeling from a global grains glut and years of depressed prices. \nThe U.S. soybean industry also faces rising competition from a growing number of synthetic and organic alternative feeds that provide more protein for less money. \nThese are troubling trends for the $41 billion U.S. soybean sector, but the industry's response has yet to take on much urgency. That's because the erosion of protein levels has come over many years, and many industry players still have short-term economic incentives to prioritize higher yields over higher protein. \n(For graphic on soybean yield, protein content and market share, see: http:\/\/tmsnrt.rs\/2CXgKQE) \nProtein levels have fallen as biotechnology and other breeding advances have pushed yield per acre to record highs, which dilutes protein content. But U.S. farmers can still make more money producing higher volumes of lower-protein crops because they only get an additional 3 to 5 cents a bushel for higher-protein beans. \nOver the long term, however, falling protein levels could have dire consequences for the U.S. industry as a whole - especially in China, which buys two-thirds of all soybeans traded in the world market to feed its vast livestock operations. \n\"China needs soybeans, and we're at risk of becoming a residual supplier if we don't work on protein improvements,\" said North Dakota farmer Jared Hagert, a director and past chairman of the United Soybean Board (USB), an industry association. \nHIGHER YIELDS, LOWER PROTEIN \nThe USB and other industry advocates are starting to take the protein problem seriously. The industry group will spend $5.6 million in fiscal year 2018 on research and other efforts to boost protein, up from $3.7 million last year. \nThey face a tough task. Like many farmers, the agribusiness giants that develop seed technology, such as Monsanto Co and DowDuPont Inc, have little incentive to focus on raising protein levels. \nSeed developers have had great success boosting yields through traditional breeding methods and genetic engineering to make crops use less water, tolerate weed killers and grow better in colder or drier climates. But they have yet to crack the genetic code that would raise protein content without hurting yield, seed breeders said. \nAt DowDuPont, scientists have identified some promising leads in boosting protein without hurting crop yields, said Steve Schnebly, senior research manager with the agriculture division of DowDuPont. But any commercially viable solution could be two decades away, he said, and isn't a company priority. \n\"Our major objective to our farmer customers is maximum yield,\" Schnebly said. \nMonsanto, the world's largest seed producer, currently has no genetic research projects focusing on elevating protein, spokeswoman Christi Dixon said in a written statement. \n\"Market potential and demand doesn't warrant the R&D investment,\" she said. \nThe protein decline coincides with a rise of cheaper and more abundant alternative feeds available to livestock and poultry producers. They include distillers grains, a byproduct of the ethanol production process, and synthetic amino acids that are mixed with corn to mimic soymeal. \nJeff Knott, a swine nutrition consultant and owner of Minnesota-based Ideal Animal Nutrition, creates recipes with such alternatives for hog feed used by producers in several Midwest states. \n\"Compared to 20 years ago, we're probably feeding 70 percent less soybean meal than we used to,\" he said. \"And it's all economically driven.\" \nLOWER PROTEIN, LOWER EXPORTS \nBrazilian soybean producers use the same genetically modified seeds as their U.S. counterparts, and have also seen a reduction in protein content. \nBut Brazilian growers retain an crucial edge in protein thanks to warmer weather and longer days. The nation's soybeans contain 37 percent protein on average, according to data from Embrapa, the government's agriculture research agency. \nThat compares to 34.1 percent for U.S. crops in 2017 - a record low, according to the U.S. Soybean Export Council. \nThe protein shortfall in this season's crop has prompted U.S. processors such as Bunge Ltd to cut the amount of protein they can guarantee in soymeal they sell. \nBrazil's three-percentage-point protein advantage is plenty enough to sway many buyers, especially when combined with the nation's recent efforts to expand production and reduce shipping delays. Since overtaking the United States as the world's top soybean exporter in 2013, Brazil has boosted production by about 40 percent. \nExpanded port capacity in northern Brazil and lower freight costs have widened the country's advantage in China, said a Brazilian trader with a large exporting company. \n\"Brazil's soybeans on average have less impurities and higher protein content,\" said the trader, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. \"Some destinations will pay a premium for that.\" \nProtein is paramount for Chinese importers, two managers at soy crushing plants and one soy meal buyer at a pig producer told Reuters in interviews. \n\"Feed producers mainly consider the cost of the soy meal - the price, and the amount of protein it contains,\" said a swine feed buyer who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak. \"With more supplies from Brazil ... we don't necessarily need to buy beans from the U.S.\" \nSCRAMBLING FOR SOLUTIONS \nThe United Soybean Board has launched a pilot project at a small number of processors and grain elevators - facilities that store and load grain for shipping - to record and analyze the protein content of soybeans delivered by local farmers. \nThe effort aims to provide highly localized data in the hope that farmers will select seed varieties that produce higher-protein crops and that soybean buyers will pay them a premium. \nOther USB efforts include financing genetics research to boost protein, including studies by researchers at the University of Illinois and by scientists at DuPont Pioneer. \n\"We've got to be cognizant as to what kind of product we are providing the end user,\" said Hagert, the USB director. \nAnother study - conducted by the University of Wisconsin and paid for by the Illinois Soybean Association and the U.S. Soybean Export Council - suggests that farmers can better compete with synthetic alternatives by planting beans with a specific amino acid balance. \nSuch soybeans can save hog feeders up to $3 a head and save chicken producers 7 cents a bird, said the study's lead author, John Osthus. \n\"Right now, there are synthetic amino acid companies that are undermining U.S. market share,\" Osthus said. \"If we don't do something about this, we're missing a huge market opportunity.\" \n(Additional reporting by Ana Mano in Sao Paulo and Dominique Patton and Hallie Gu in Beijing; Editing by Simon Webb and Brian Thevenot)"}

Bienaime was speaking with CNBC's Meg Tirrell at the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. Published 13 Mins Ago 31 Mins Ago | 06:47 \nBioMarin's Jean-Jacques Bienaime said the company's hemophilia treatment could fundamentally change the quality of life for patients struggling with the disease. \nHemophilia A is a genetic disorder caused by a missing or defective clotting protein known as factor VIII, which can lead to excessive bleeding after an injury. \nBioMarin has been having marked success in the space. Its treatment recently entered Phase 3 late-stage studies, which would support U.S. and European marketing applications. \n\"The cure word is a big world, but I would say the data we just reported recently at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December is extremely encouraging,\" Bienaime said. \"We took patients that had less than 1 percent of factor VIII expression ... to, for the vast majority of them in the kind of normal range, 50 to 150 percent expression.\" \nBienaime spoke with CNBC at the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. \nDespite the progress in its hemophilia treatment, the company's shares have only climbed 2 percent in the past 12 months. \nTo be sure, while only a small number of patients have received the treatment to date, Bienaime said that such a dramatic increase in factor VIII expression allows patients to participate in physical activities otherwise deemed too dangerous for those living with the disease. \n\"Hemophiliac patients today, although they can be treated with recombinant factor VIII injections, they are very careful about their physical activity,\" added the CEO. \"Here we have patients that now have normal physical activity.\" \nWhile the BioMarin chief did not address questions about the potential price of the gene therapy \u2014 called valoctocogene roxaparvovec \u2014 Bienaime did address the concerns broadly. \n\"I think most of the rhetorical issues have been around egregious price increases. That not our business model,\" he told CNBC. \"Generally, we have increased our price in the U.S. around inflation in the past five years.

The Philadelphia-based biotechnology company also revealed Wednesday morning a set of payment and access programs, including tying payments to how well the therapy works and exploring payment by installment.\nThe treatment is delivered just once, a facet of gene therapy that poses unique pricing questions in an industry fueled by steady payments for chronic therapies.\n\"It's wildly expensive but, to be very frank, I think they've priced it what I'll call responsibly,\" said Dr. Steve Miller, chief medical officer of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts , which is partnering with Spark on distribution and specialty pharmacy services for Luxturna. \"The product is just phenomenally innovative, and we've been talking about gene therapy for over 20 years. We're now at the threshold of having gene therapy reaching patients.\"\nWall Street expectations for Luxturna's price were around a million dollars, and Spark's $425,000 for each eye comes in under that mark.\n\"It came down to the value we believed was inherent in the therapy,\" Spark Chief Executive Officer Jeff Marrazzo said in an interview. He, as well as Miller, spoke with CNBC ahead of the announcement on condition the information not be published until the news was public.\n\"We also heard and did market research with payers ... and wanted to take into account the questions and challenges they had about affordability,\" Marrazzo continued. \"Ultimately this is about access.\"\nGene therapy involves the delivery, using a modified virus, of a healthy copy of a gene to make up for one that's deficient in a way that causes disease. In the retinal dystrophy Spark aims to treat with Luxturna, which the company estimates affects between 1,000 and 2,000 people in the U.S., mutations in a gene called RPE65 lead to impaired vision that deteriorates over time.\nIn clinical trials, patients' sight was assessed by their ability to navigate an obstacle course in different levels of light. Those receiving Luxturna showed significant improvement in their ability to do so at low light after a year.\nPatients who participated in the trial also described, in interviews and in testimony to a panel of FDA advisers, seeing snowflakes for the first time or being able to read again.\nA new form of medical treatment brings with it new challenges, not only in its price. Marrazzo said Luxturna will only be available at half a dozen treatment centers in the U.S. throughout this year, so Spark will ensure financial support and logistics for travel and accommodations.\nThe company also outlined several plans for new payment models that Marrazzo says aim to ensure access for patients, recognize the value of the product for Spark, and remove extra cost and risk for insurers and hospitals.\nOne is an agreement with Harvard Pilgrim, a nonprofit health plan covering 1.2 million people, to pay rebates if a patient's vision doesn't meet certain thresholds in 30 to 90 days, and then 30 months after treatment, under a model known as outcomes-based pricing.\n\"What's important and unique about the product is not just standing behind the efficacy but behind the long-term durability from a single dose,\" Marrazzo said.\nAnother recently approved one-time therapy, Novartis' Kymriah for a form of leukemia, also has an outcomes-based pledge: If the treatment isn't working after a month, Novartis doesn't get paid. That treatment is priced at $475,000.\nBoth Kymriah and another one-time cancer treatment approved in 2017, Gilead's Yescarta, are referred to by the FDA as gene therapies because they involve genetically modifying patients' own immune cells to identify cancer. They're known as CAR-T therapies.\nLuxturna is the first of a crop of treatments that target diseases caused by mutations in specific genes, and thus is referred to by many as the first gene therapy in the U.S.\nSpark also announced a program Wednesday, through a partnership with Express Scripts, to offer a way for insurers to purchase Luxturna directly, avoiding a so-called buy and bill model in which treatment centers administering a drug must purchase it upfront.\nThe goal is to remove the risk for treatment centers in purchasing, handling and waiting for reimbursement of expensive products, and to alleviate for insurers potential markup costs imposed by the treatment centers, Marrazzo said.\nHe said the company is in active discussions with additional insurers, with coverage announcements coming over the next few weeks and months.\nExpress Scripts, which in its role as a pharmacy benefit manager negotiates drug prices and reimbursement on behalf of insurers and employers, \"will work with health plans and plan sponsors to decide where they want [Luxturna] on their plans,\" Miller said. He said Express Scripts will receive a dispensing fee for its work with Spark, \"not dependent on the price of the drug.\"\nFinally, Spark is also exploring a much-discussed idea for paying for expensive, one-time treatments: staggered payments that would spread costs out over time.\nSome of the challenges for this are government requirements tying prices to the lowest available, and the fact that patients switch health insurance providers numerous times over the course of their lives \u2014 an average of every three years, according to Spark.\nMarrazzo said the company is in talks with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, including Administrator Seema Verma, on a proposal that would waive some of those requirements, enabling it to offer an installment payment option and bigger rebates linked to how well the treatment works.\n\"We're at the infancy of what I think could be a lot of innovations in how we pay for these really expensive drugs,\" Express Scripts' Miller said. \"We've got to figure this out, because \u2014 let's be frank \u2014 there are going to be more of these drugs coming to the marketplace for even bigger populations.\""}

The payment date for the distribution is January 10, 2018.\nThe $9.00 per Share distribution represents approximately 42% of ReHo's closing stock price on January 3, 2018.

Because the distribution is expected to exceed 25% of ReHo's Share price, NASDAQ will apply this rule, and ReHo expects, in accordance with this rule, that the ex-dividend date as set by NASDAQ, will be January 11, 2018, the first business day following the payment date for the distribution. Shareholders of record on the record date, January 4, 2018, who sell their Shares prior to the ex\u2011distribution date, January 11, 2018, will not receive the $9.00 cash distribution.\nShareholders who have additional questions or who require further clarification, are advised to contact their broker.\nAbout Retail Holdings\nRetail Holdings N.V. is a holding company with one principal asset, a 54.1% equity interest in Sewko Holdings Limited (\"Sewko\"), the parent company of Singer Asia Limited, a distributor of consumer durable products through public subsidiaries in Bangladesh and India, with a residual equity interest in a similar business in Sri Lanka.

REUTERS\/Stringer\/File Photo They are due to appear in court in the main city of Yangon on Wednesday. It will be their second appearance in court and the prosecutor could request that charges are filed against them.\nFollowing is some information about the case.\nTHE TWO JOURNALISTS Wa Lone\u2019s first job in journalism was with the People\u2019s Age journal. In 2014, he joined the English-language Myanmar Times, covering the 2015 election that swept Nobel peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to power. Wa Lone wrote a children\u2019s book and co-founded a charity that promotes tolerance between different ethnic groups and helps orphans.\nWa Lone joined Reuters in 2016 and made his mark with reports on sensitive subjects. His work on the crisis that erupted in Rakhine State in October 2016 won him a joint honourable mention from the Society of Publishers in Asia in its annual awards. He returned to the region last year, after attacks by Rohingya Muslim militants triggered a crackdown by the army and an exodus to Bangladesh of some 650,000 Rohingya.\nKyaw Soe Oo is an ethnic Rakhine Buddhist who grew up in the state capital, Sittwe. He started his reporting career with the online Rakhine Development News and later worked at the Root Investigative Agency.\nFriends say Kyaw Soe Oo avoided becoming caught up in the tension between Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims but the conflict drew him into journalism.\nHe has been with Reuters since September last year.\nTHE ARRESTS AND ACCUSATIONS Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested on Dec. 12, after they were invited to meet police for dinner in Yangon, on suspicion of violating the Official Secrets Act. The Ministry of Information has cited the police as saying they were \u201carrested for possessing important and secret government documents related to Rakhine State and security forces\u201d.\nThe ministry said they had \u201cillegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media\u201d.\nThe government only announced the arrest of the reporters some 24 hours after they were detained and the two were held at an undisclosed location without contact with families or lawyers for two weeks.\nThey have told relatives they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some documents by two policemen who they met at the restaurant for the first time. They did not read the documents.\nFILE PHOTO: Reuters reporter Kyaw Soe Oo looks out from a police vehicle as he leaves a court in Yangon, Myanmar, December 27, 2017. REUTERS\/Stringer\/File Photo The government has said two police officers were also arrested and charged under the Official Secrets Act. According to the reporters, the police arrested were not those who provided the documents. The government has given no further information on the police arrested.\nTHE LAW The Official Secrets Act dates back to 1923, when Myanmar, then known as Burma, was a province of British India. It carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.\nLegal experts say prosecutions under it have been rare.\nThe most well-documented recent case was in 2014, when the Unity Journal weekly published an article it said exposed a secret military chemical weapons factory.\nPolice arrested the newspaper\u2019s chief executive and four journalists. A civilian court sentenced them to 10 years in prison with hard labour - later reduced to seven years. The case was widely seen as a warning that military affairs remained off-limits even though direct military rule had ended and censorship had been lifted.\nThe five were released under an amnesty in April 2016, soon after Suu Kyi\u2019s party came to power.\nTHE COURT PROCEEDINGS Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were held incommunicado by the police for two weeks before appearing in court on Dec. 27, when they were remanded for another two weeks. During the hearing, they were allowed to meet relatives and a lawyer for the first time since being arrested.\nOnly their lawyer and relatives, along with police and government lawyers, were allowed into the court. The reporters said they had not been mistreated in custody.\nThey are due to appear in court again on Wednesday.\nREACTION Government officials from some of the world\u2019s major nations, including the United States, Britain and Canada, as well as top U.N. officials, have called for the release of the journalists.\nSurakiart Sathirathai, a former Thai foreign minister and the head of a new international advisory panel on the Rohingya crisis, also expressed concern at the arrest of the reporters and said he hoped the case did not lead to broader restrictions on the international media.\nSeveral non-governmental and journalist organisations have called the arrests an attack on the freedom of the press.\nWriting by Robert Birsel; Editing by Alex Richardson\n "}

State law gives insurers more leeway to drop coverage than to raise rates, and some have been taking the opportunity to not renew policies, a trend concerning Jones. \nThe California Department of Insurance lacks authority to regulate how insurers underwrite property insurance, a problem the state\u2019s legislature must fix, Jones said. \nHe unveiled legislative proposals to change computer models that homeowner insurers rely on for house-by-house predictions of risk, now using factors such as local topography and brush cover. Jones wants to require the models to include wildfire mitigation efforts, such as homeowner or community efforts to clear brush, according to the report. \n\u201cThere are no specific statutory standards in place to ensure the models\u2019 accuracy or reliability in rating and underwriting of homeowners\u2019 insurance,\u201d Jones said in the report. \nJones also wants homeowners to be able to appeal the risk scores that models generate which insurers use to make coverage decisions. \nIt was unclear whether legislators would take up Jones\u2019 proposals, but at least one California lawmaker has suggested that insurers give discounts when homeowners reduce their wildfire risks. \n\u201cWe look forward to reviewing Commissioner Jones\u2019 recommendations and working with him and other policymakers to address wildfire safety and recovery efforts, while balancing the need to remain solvent and pay future claims,\u201d said Mark Sektnan, vice president of state government relations for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America. \nHomeowners can already appeal risk scores by talking to insurers who, in turn, can ask risk modeling companies to review the property again, said Janet Ruiz, a spokeswoman for the industry\u2019s Insurance Information Institute. \nThe 2017 wildfires will not change Allstate Corp\u2019s underwriting in the state, said the insurer\u2019s chief executive officer, Tom Wilson, in an unrelated interview on Thursday. Allstate already scaled back its wildfire exposure four to five years ago, said Wilson. \n\u201cBut you do have to make sure over time that you\u2019re collecting the proper amount of money for that,\u201d Wilson said.

The company was losing users to smartphone games. This prompted management to announce that it was launching some mobile offerings. This was realized with \"Pokemon Go,\" and then with later games such as \"Super Mario Run\" and \"Fire Emblem Heroes.\"\nIn the six months to September 30, Nintendo's last official earnings announcements, mobile games raked in 17.9 billion yen ($117.2 million), a 426 percent year-on-year increase. \nBut Nintendo owns just a small stake in The Pokemon Company, which licenses its intellectual property to game developer Niantic. So the overall contribution of \"Pokemon Go\" to Nintendo's earnings is limited. However, it played an important role in 2016 to bring interest back to the Japanese gaming brand.\n\"Pokemon Go had a halo impact on existing Nintendo hardware and software and led to an increase in 3DS sales and related Pokemon games,\" Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at IHS, told CNBC by email.\n\"It certainly helped re-position the brand in the run up to the launch of the Switch along with the announcement of first-party games coming to smartphones and tablets.\"\nNintendo Switch gives boost When the Nintendo Switch was launched last year , there were some skeptical analysts . The console is unusual in that it is a hybrid, allowing users to play on their TV, then pick up the tablet-like device and continue playing the game from where they left off, on the go.\nBut the company announced in mid-December that it had sold more than 10 million Switch units since the March 2017 launch. In October, it upped its forecast for Switch sales saying it expects to sell 14 million units by the end of March 2018. \nAkio Kon | Bloomberg | Getty Images A statue of Nintendo's video-game character Mario \"The successful launch of the Switch is down to a flexible form factor making it attractive to a cross-section of regional consumers and a very strong slate of first-party titles, which have resonated strongly with its target audience,\" Harding-Rolls said.\nFirst-party titles refer to games that Nintendo has produced, such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\" and \"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe,\" the two top-selling games on the Switch.\nWhat next? Keeping up the momentum will be key for Nintendo, according to analysts. With the initial hype around the Switch potentially dying down, Nintendo will need to get other people beyond the core user, to buy the console.\nThis will mean signing third-party developers to make games. Many are already on there, such as Electronic Arts, which makes the popular \"FIFA\" soccer game franchise. But mobile, which is still a small part of the business, will be crucial.\n\"With monetization of Nintendo's mobile games a little hit and miss, I believe it needs to build out a portfolio of games to generate a significant amount of revenue from this part of the market,\" Harding-Rolls said."}

The dollar index, reflecting the dollar's value against a basket of currencies, tumbled 1 percent to about 89.25.\nMnuchin's comments echo statements by President Donald Trump, who famously helped turn a market trend of a stronger dollar last January when he said, prior to his inauguration, that the dollar was \"too strong\" and that U.S. companies can't compete because of it, particularly against the Chinese. The dollar index has lost more than 10 percent since then, and after Mnuchin's comment Wednesday morning, it sank to the lowest level since December, 2014.\n\"Obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities,\" Mnuchin told reporters, according to Bloomberg, adding that the currency's short-term value is \"not a concern of ours at all.\" Mnuchin speaks on a panel in Davos Wednesday morning, at 11 a.m. CET.\n\"We're objectively looking at the situation, and we're waiting to see what he says. If it is a shift in dollar policy, that would be very significant,\" said Ben Randol, G-10 foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nEuropean Central Bank President Mario Draghi also speaks Thursday after an interest rate meeting, and he may too be asked to comment on the surge in the euro. A sharply higher euro could be problematic for Europe's exporters, while a weaker dollar would help U.S. exports.\nHowever, too much dollar weakness also makes U.S. assets, including Treasury debt, less attractive, and pushes the cost of goods higher for businesses and everyday Americans.\nMnuchin's comment carried a particular sting since they follow new tariffs issued this week by the Trump administration on washing machines and solar panels. The U.S. this week is also engaged in a sixth round of talks to renegotiate the NAFTA agreement with Canada and Mexico.\nPresident Donald Trump will speak at Davos on Friday, and U.S. officials, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross are promoting 'America first' policies on trade at the Davos gathering.\nSome strategists believe Mnuchin's comments may have been taken out of context, since the Treasury secretary also spoke at the same time in favor of a strong dollar\u2014U.S. policy since the 1990s.\n\"Longer term, the strength of the dollar is a reflection of the strength of the U.S. economy and the fact that it is and will continue to be the primary currency in terms of the reserve currency,\" Mnuchin was Quote: d as saying.\nBut the market chose to focus on the comment about weakness, possibly because the Davos gathering is viewed as a bastion of globalization and free trade. Later, Ross attempted to change the narrative in an interview on CNBC, when he took issue with the interpretation that the U.S. is in a policy shift, but the dollar continued to weaken.\nThe White House, however, did not say much to clarify the situation, saying only that it believes in a free trading currency and that the dollar is stable.\nMnuchin's comments, if they do indicate a shift, depart from the policy of the past three presidential administrations and Treasury secretaries, going back to Robert Rubin. Prior to Trump, presidents in recent history have refrained from talking the currency up or down.\nThe dollar lost 0.8 percent against the euro, which reached 1.24 in U.S. trading, and 1 percent against the yen."}

Clothing chain Next provided some initial cheer, beating expectations and upgrading its profit forecast.

For instance, computers could be added to networks to make up for the lack of processor speed in individual machines, he added. \nSome popular antivirus software programs are incompatible with the software updates, causing desktop and laptop computers to freeze up and show a \u201cblue screen of death,\u201d researcher Johnson said. \nAntivirus software makers responded by rolling out fixes to make their products compatible with the updated operating systems, he said. In a blog posting on Friday, Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) said it would only offer security patches to Windows customers whose antivirus software suppliers had confirmed with Microsoft that the patch would not crash the customer\u2019s machine. \n\u201cIf you have not been offered the security update, you may be running incompatible antivirus software, and you should consult the software vendor,\u201d Microsoft advised in the blog post. Slideshow (3 Images) \nGovernment agencies also are watching. The Ohio Attorney General\u2019s office is monitoring the situation, a spokesman said by email. \n\u201cIntel continues to believe that the performance impact of these updates is highly workload-dependent and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time,\u201d the world\u2019s No. 1 chipmaker said on Thursday in a release. \nIt cited Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ), Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ), Alphabet Inc\u2019s ( GOOGL.O ) and Microsoft as saying that most users had seen no significant impact on performance after installing the patches. \nThe cloud vendors are among a group of firms that quickly patched their technology to mitigate against the threat from one of those vulnerabilities, dubbed Meltdown, which only affects machines running Intel chips. \nMajor software makers have not issued patches to protect against the second vulnerability, dubbed Spectre, which affects nearly all computer chips made in the last decade, including those from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc ( AMD.O ), and ARM-architecture manufacturers, including Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ). \nHowever, Google, Firefox and Microsoft have implemented measures in most web browsers to stop hackers from launching remote attacks using Spectre. \nGovernments and security experts say they have seen no cyber attacks seeking to exploit either vulnerability, though they expect attempts by hackers as they digest technical data about the security flaws. \nOne key risk is that hackers will develop code that can infect the personal computers of people visiting malicious websites, said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer of cyber security firm Veracode. \nHe advised PC owners to install the patches to protect against such potential attacks. Computer servers at large enterprises are less at risk, he said, because those systems are not used to surf the web and can only be infected in a Meltdown attack if a hacker has already breached that network. \nMicrosoft has issued a patch for its Windows operating system, and Apple desktop users with the most recent operating system are protected. Google has said most of its Chromebook laptops are already protected and that the rest would be soon. \nApple said it planned to release a patch to its Safari web browser within coming days to protect Mac and iOS users from Spectre. \nWhile third-party browsers from Google and others can protect Mac users from Spectre, all major web browsers for Apple\u2019s iOS devices depend on receiving a patch from Apple. Until then, hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users will be exposed to potential Spectre attacks while browsing the Web. Editing by Richard Chang"}

{"published":"2018-01-04T16:11:00.000+02:00","title":"In new rule, Trump tries to deliver a health care promise","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Striving to fulfill a campaign promise, the Trump administration moved Thursday to facilitate the interstate sale of health insurance policies that cost less but may not cover as much.\nThe proposed regulation from the Labor Department would provide more health insurance options for self-employed people and small businesses, but its success depends on buy-in from insurers, state regulators, plan sponsors and consumers themselves. Some groups already have concerns.\nDon't look for revolutionary changes, said analyst Elizabeth Carpenter of the health industry consultancy Avalere Health. \"The impact on the markets and on consumers really may depend on whether it is easy enough for the groups potentially affected to take advantage of the rule,\" she said.\nNo sweeping consequences are seen for the more than 170 million Americans with employer-sponsored coverage, or the nearly 30 million still uninsured.\nThe complex proposal aims to deliver on President Donald Trump's long-standing pledge to increase competition and lower costs by promoting the sale of health plans across state lines. Unable to repeal the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, the administration is pursuing regulations to change the marketplace.\nThe new rule would make it easier for groups, or associations, to sponsor health plans that don't have to meet all consumer protection and benefit requirements of the Obama law. Those requirements improve coverage, but also raise premiums.\nInsurance industry groups are skeptical of Trump's idea, saying it could undermine the current state markets. Patient groups are concerned about losing protections. Some state regulators object to federal interference.\nIn a recent interview, Trump predicted big changes would result from the combination of this expected proposal, known as \"association health plans,\" and the GOP's recent repeal of the ACA's requirement that most people get health insurance or risk fines.\n\"So now I have associations,\" Trump told The New York Times last week. \"I have private insurance companies coming and will sell private health care plans to people through associations. That's gonna be millions and millions of people. People have no idea how big that is. And by the way, and for that, we've ended 'across state lines.' So we have competition.\"\nTrump appeared to be referring to current obstacles that deter an insurer in one state from marketing to customers in another state. Some of those barriers have to do with state regulations that differ in the kinds of benefits that insurers must cover. For example, one state may require robust coverage for children with autism, while another may not.\nUnder the administration's proposal, health plans sponsored by associations would gain enhanced status under a federal law that generally exempts large employer plans from state regulation. Experts are poring over the proposal to determine precisely to what degree such exemptions would apply to the new plans.\nThe Labor Department said the proposal could benefit up to 11 million people who are self-employed or work for small businesses, and lack employer coverage. Association plans, called \"Small Business Health Plans\" in the proposal, would be open to small employers and sole proprietors and their families.\nThe plans could be organized along the lines of an industry, enabling them to market anywhere in the country. Or they could be set up to serve communities, including major metro areas that span several states, such as the tri-state New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area.\nThe department said such plans would not be able to charge individuals higher premiums because of health issues or turn down applicants with medical problems.\n\"The Affordable Care Act's ending of discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions has become almost sacrosanct,\" said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\nHowever, the regulations allow higher premiums based on age, gender and other factors, said legal analyst Timothy Jost. Interested parties have 60 days to comment.\nThe main insurance industry groups, along with organizations representing patients and consumers, worry that the administration's approach could siphon healthy people away from the health law's insurance markets, creating a spiral of rising premiums for people who need comprehensive benefits.\n\"We are concerned that this could create or expand alternative, parallel markets for health coverage, which would lead to higher premiums for consumers, particularly those with pre-existing conditions,\" according to a letter last month to state regulators, signed by America's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.\nEven before Thursday's development, Pennsylvania's acting insurance commissioner, Jessica Altman, had her own concerns. \"Generally speaking, these types of plans are exempt from state law and outside my jurisdiction,\" the Democratic appointee said in an interview. \"That means any issues that consumers have, I won't be able to help them. More and more people would fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government, and I think state regulators would say we really do it better.\"\nThe administration plan won accolades from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., long an advocate of association health plans. But groups on the political left denounced it as another attempt to sabotage former President Barack Obama's health law.\nAssociated Press Health Writer Tom Murphy contributed to this report."}

An effective nuclear deterrent was also less expensive than war, it said. New weapons \nThe draft document noted that Russia and China were modernizing their nuclear arsenals, while North Korea's nuclear provocations \"threaten regional and global peace.\" \nThe draft document said the United States, while honoring all treaty commitments, would pursue development of a new nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile. It would also modify a small number of existing submarine-launched ballistic missile, or SLBM, warheads to provide a nuclear option with a lower payload. \nIn what arms control experts said appeared to be a nod to the threat of a devastating cyber attack, perhaps one that could knock down the U.S. power grid, the document also left open the possibility of nuclear retaliation in \"extreme circumstances.\" \n\"Extreme circumstances could include significant non-nuclear strategic attacks,\" it said. \nKingston Reif, director for disarmament research at the Arms Control Association advocacy group, said the draft document was a departure from long-standing U.S. policy. \n\"It expands the scenarios under which the United States might use nuclear weapons and therefore increases the risk of nuclear weapons use,\" Rief said. \nAlthough it reaffirmed an Obama-era pledge not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states if they joined and adhered to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the draft introduced a caveat. The United States reserved the right to alter that assurance, given the evolving threat from non-nuclear technologies. \nMichaela Dodge, senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said the draft document appeared to be intentionally ambiguous about when and how the United States might retaliate, to better deter adversaries. \n\"If we are explicit about saying (when) we will not retaliate with the strongest weapons we have, we are implicitly telling our adversaries you can plan for these scenarios more freely,\" Dodge said."}

Despite forecasts, these popular market plays are already deep in the hole for 2018, and it's still only January. The momentum of the 2017 market trends carrying into this year has been strong as record amounts of money rush into equities. SHARES Bryan R. Smith | AFP | Getty Images Traders work on the floor at the closing bell of the Dow Industrial Average at the New York Stock Exchange on January 17, 2018 in New York. \nSome of the most popular market plays for 2018 are already deep in the hole, before January is even two-thirds over. \nA broad consensus had formed among strategists and money managers heading into the year along a couple of fronts: Small-cap stocks should begin outperforming big ones after lagging in 2017, and cheaper value stocks would close the performance gap with growth. \nThe reasoning was simple and clear: Corporate tax cuts will disproportionately benefit smaller companies with more domestic operations. And value stocks \u2014 which tend to be more cyclical \u2014 are a better bet when the economy is accelerating and rates are rising. \nIt's early, but neither trade is working well. And the fast start for the broad benchmarks means the performance differential is already pretty stiff. \nHere's a look at how the very largest stocks, in the form of the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF ( MGK ), have easily outpaced the small-cap iShares Russell 2000 ETF ( IWM ). \nLarge versus small-cap stocks (MGK is blue, IWM is green) \nThe growth-over-value split is slightly narrower, but still pretty pronounced so far, with the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF ( IWF ) outpacing its value counterpart ( IWD ) by more than two percentage points so far in 2018. \nGrowth versus value stocks ( IWF is blue, IWD is green) \nSo what did the crowd get wrong? \nFor one thing, the momentum of the 2017 market trends carrying into this year has been strong as new money has rushed into equities, at what Bank of America Merrill Lynch says is the heaviest four-week inflow in history. Investors are simply chasing the strength in the market and want broad exposure, rather than nuanced bets on particular segments linked to particular tax-exposure factors or style bets. \nAs a broad rule, stock sectors don't follow a policy script all that closely. For instance, when taxes on dividends were cut dramatically in 2003, dividend-rich stocks didn't outperform a rising market. Also, very large stocks often lead in the later phases of a bull market. And while the earnings-growth boost from lower taxes will be significant for many smaller stocks this year, that doesn't mean the market has decided to shun the giant growth stocks that promise double-digit profit gains for years to come. \nThat also explains why value stocks have done fine, but haven't kept pace with Big Tech and other growth leaders. \nIt might take substantially higher interest rates to get financial stocks \u2014 a huge chunk of value indexes\u2014 on a sustained surge, and to finally compress the valuations of those richly valued \"organic growth\" FANG-type names. \nNot every popular call has come up short this month, of course. Strategists in general have been preaching the wisdom of tilting toward non-U.S. stocks, which as a group have been slightly outperforming the U.S. indexes. This also is a \"tell\" that the sped-up rally lately has been about a lot more than the Republican tax cut. \nAnd banks are also a broadly loved group, for many obvious reasons relating to taxes, deregulation and higher rates. They've slightly outpaced the S&P 500 so far after lagging a bit last year. \nMuch can change as a year goes on; the leadership profile of the market shifted hard and unexpectedly in the first quarter last year from deeply cyclical and financial stocks to FANG-like growth giants. \nAs they say in sports, that's why they play the games.

The approvals follow recent MR-conditional labeling approvals for the Assurity MRI\u2122 pacemaker, Ellipse\u2122 ICD and associated MRI-compatible leads, and further expand Abbott's portfolio of MRI-ready devices for patients indicated for ICDs and\/or CRT-D devices who may need an MRI in the future.\nPhysicians utilize ICDs to restore normal heart rhythms in patients at risk for experiencing potentially life-threatening heart rhythms; they implant CRT-D devices to help the lower chambers of the heart beat in rhythm in patients battling progressive congestive heart failure and improve blood flow throughout the body. For some patients, the potential need for a future MRI has made MR-conditional labeling important as physicians assess therapies and device options. As a result, Abbott has done extensive testing to demonstrate that these devices are safe in the most commonly-used MRI scanners.\n\"For many patients who need an ICD or CRT-D device, receiving a device that is MRI-ready is a key benefit that can ensure future access to MRIs -- an important and commonly-used diagnostic tool,\" said Avi Fischer, M.D., divisional vice president, medical affairs, and medical director of Abbott's cardiac rhythm management business. \"We are excited to expand our portfolio and add MR-conditional labeling to the Fortify Assura ICD and Quadra Assura MP CRT-D to provide patients and their physicians additional peace of mind if those patients need an MRI in the future.\"\nIn addition to MRI compatibility, Abbott's Fortify Assura ICD and Quadra Assura MP CRT-D also include the company's suite of TailoredTherapy\u2122 features, which are designed to provide physicians additional flexibility and control in how they deliver therapy to treat their patient's cardiac arrhythmias and congestive heart failure, even as their patient's therapy needs change over time. With the TailoredTherapy feature set, the Fortify Assura ICD and Quadra Assura MP CRT-D help protect against the delivery of unnecessary therapy and continuously evaluate the condition of a lead to consistently deliver appropriate therapy. Combined with MRI compatibility, these features offer physicians additional options to leverage when managing patient care.\nThe Quadra Assura MP CRT-D also offers Abbott's proprietary MultiPoint\u2122 Pacing and SyncAV\u2122 technology to provide additional options for CRT patients who are not responsive to traditional cardiac resynchronization therapy. With MultiPoint Pacing, Abbott allows physicians to \"individualize\" cardiac resynchronization therapy and shift their patient's treatment options from a single point of pacing to multiple options to better deliver therapy where needed. Abbott's SynvAV software allows a CRT device to detect real-time changes in a patient's cardiac condition and adjust therapy accordingly.\nAs with all Abbott cardiac rhythm management devices, all therapy data captured by the Fortify Assura and Quadra Assura MP devices can be directly, securely and wirelessly sent to a patient's doctor through the Merlin.net\u2122 Patient Care Network. This communication allows physicians to remotely monitor their patient's therapy and assess any need for intervention.\nFor more information about Abbott's focus on cardiac rhythm management, visit www.sjm.com\/en\/patients\/arrhythmias .\nAbout Abbott:\nAt Abbott, we're committed to helping people live their best possible life through the power of health.

She said she was returning to her former post in the TV newsroom in London where she expected to be paid equally to men in equal jobs. \n\u201cI am not asking for more money. I believe I am very well paid already -- especially as someone working for a publicly funded organization. I simply want the BBC to abide by the law and value men and women equally,\u201d she wrote on her website. \nGracie said she was paid 135,000 pounds ($182,800) a year as China editor. According to last July\u2019s disclosures, North America Editor Jon Sopel earned between 200,000 and 250,000 pounds a year, while Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen was in the 150,000 to 200,000 bracket. \nEurope editor Katya Adler, the BBC\u2019s only other female editor in foreign news, did not feature in the disclosures, meaning her pay was less than 150,000 pounds. \nGracie said managers had offered to increase her pay to 180,000 pounds, but that was no solution. She rejected the rise and insisted that all four of the BBC\u2019s international editors should receive equal pay. \n\u201cI was not interested in more money. I was interested in equality,\u201d she said during an interview on BBC radio. FILE PHOTO: The main entrance to the BBC headquarters and studios is seen in Portland Place, London, Britain, July 16, 2015. REUTERS\/Peter Nicholls\/File Photo \nBritain enacted legislation outlawing sex discrimination in the 1970s and this was followed by an equality act in 2010, but women still earn less than men across much of the economy. \n\u201cENOUGH IS ENOUGH\u201d \nThe BBC defended itself by saying its gender pay gap was below the national average and less bad than at many other organizations, adding that it was committed to wiping it out by 2020. It also said an independent audit of rank and file staff had found \u201cno systemic discrimination against women\u201d at the BBC. \nSeveral high-profile women seized on the Gracie story to say the problem was much bigger than the BBC and affected the whole of society. \n\u201cTip of the iceberg in @BBC & most other orgs (organizations). Equality Act 2010 means no hiding place for shameful discrimination against women. Ending it long overdue,\u201d wrote prominent lawmaker Harriet Harman of the opposition Labour Party, a long-time advocate of women\u2019s equality, on Twitter. \nAs in many other countries, pay inequality based on gender has been a persistent problem in Britain, which by some measures has performed worse than comparable European countries in recent years. Britain was ranked 15th in the World Economic Forum\u2019s global gender gap index 2017, below France and Germany. \nBut Gracie said her complaint was not about the gender pay gap the BBC admits to, which stems from men earning more on average because they do more of the best paid jobs. \u201cIt is men earning more in the same jobs or jobs of equal value. It is pay discrimination and it is illegal,\u201d she said. \nGracie accused the BBC of adopting a botched \u201cdivide and rule\u201d response to the legitimate anger of female staff, offering pay rises to some women while locking down others in a protracted complaints process. In her own case, the process had been \u201cdismayingly incompetent and undermining\u201d, she said. \n\u201cEnough is enough. The rise of China is one of the biggest stories of our time and one of the hardest to tell,\u201d she wrote, citing Chinese state censorship, surveillance, police harassment and official intimidation. \n\u201cI cannot do it justice while battling my bosses and a byzantine complaints process.\u201d Additional reporting by Michael Martina in Beijing; editing by David Stamp"}

After agreeing to the project, the two connected a few months later and started talking about the pay gap between men and women and the need for there to be equality. \nFrazer Harrison\/Getty Images Jessica Chastain plays a scientist in the movie \"Interstellar.\" The Oscar-winning actress said she told Chastain, \"But here's the thing, women of color on that spectrum, we make far less than white women. So, if we're gonna have that conversation about pay equity, we gotta bring the women of color to the table.\"\nSpencer says Chastain admitted that she had no idea that women of color faced an even greater pay disparity and agreed they would work together to ensure she receives equal pay for their upcoming film.\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute , women in the United States are paid 83 cents for every dollar a man earns. When it comes to women of color, that number is even lower \u2014 black women and Hispanic women are paid 65 cents and 59 cents, respectively, for every dollar a white man earns.\n\"I love that woman, because she's walking the walk and she's actually talking the talk,\" Spencer said of Chastain. \"She said, 'Octavia we're gonna get you paid on this film. You and I are gonna be tied together. We're gonna be favored nations, and we're gonna make the same thing.' Fast forward to last week, we're making five times what we asked for.\"\nJill Gonzalez, an analyst at financial website WalletHub , says the key to creating real change is for more women to be in leadership positions and involved in decisions about compensation. \n\"The pay gap still persists because women continue to have disproportionate representation in both corporate leadership positions, as well as political ones,\" she tells CNBC Make It .\nLike this story?

But I haven't made up my mind,\" on who should succeed Kuroda when his term ends in April, he added. \nMany analysts see a good chance that Kuroda will be reappointed when the government selects successors to him and his two deputies in coming months, decisions that need parliament's approval. \nAbe said Japan's economy was showing signs of emerging from deflation, with a tightening job market pushing up wages. \n\"We'll deploy all available policies so that we can declare an end to deflation at the earliest date possible,\" Abe said. \n\"It might not necessarily be this year, but the government and the BOJ must fulfill their responsibilities,\" he added, so as to ensure conditions to bring about an end to deflation. \nThe government looks at several factors, such as inflation data and the output gap, in determining whether the economy is sustainably out of deflation. \nSome policymakers are keen to declare an end to deflation, which would help Abe argue his policies succeeded in reflating the economy. But doing so could also give the BOJ justification to withdraw crisis-mode stimulus, some analysts say. \nJapan's economy expanded for the seventh straight quarter in July-September, boosted by robust exports and capital expenditure. \nCore consumer inflation rose 0.9 percent in November from a year earlier, marking the 11th straight month of gains but still distant from the BOJ's target of 2 percent. \nAbe has urged companies to raise wages by 3 percent or more this year on the view that wage hikes are critical to boost consumption and sustain Japan's strengthening economic recovery."}

(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co executives have voiced support for the Fox television studio\u2019s adult-oriented programming and development is continuing as usual while a proposed merger undergoes regulatory review, Fox executives and producers said Thursday. FILE PHOTO: The Twenty-First Century Fox Studios flag flies over the company building in Los Angeles, California U.S. on November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo \nIn December, Disney announced plans to acquire the Fox TV studio, the FX and National Geographic cable channels and other assets from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox conglomerate. \nFox produces edgy adult comedies such as \u201cFamily Guy\u201d and gory dramas such as \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d that contrast with Disney\u2019s family-friendly movies and TV shows. \nRyan Murphy, producer of several Fox and FX hits including \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d said he received a phone call from Disney CEO Bob Iger and was blunt about his concerns. \n\u201cThe stuff that I do is not specifically Disney,\u201d Murphy said he told Iger. \u201cI\u2018m concerned about that. Am I going to have to put Mickey Mouse in \u2018American Horror Story?'\u201d \nIger told him Disney was interested in buying Fox because it believes in its assets, executives and creators, said Murphy, who spoke at a Television Critics Association meeting where networks promote upcoming shows.

He noted that Iger had successfully integrated Pixar Animation Studios and Marvel Entertainment \u201cwhile keeping their communities intact.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m interested in seeing what that company is going to look like before I decide where to go,\u201d Murphy said. \nThe deal sparked anxiety among some other producers of Fox shows, said Gary Newman, co-chairman and co-CEO of Fox Television Group. Newman said he met with many producers to assure them it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d during the regulatory review, which is projected to take 12 to 18 months. \n\u201cWhen we did hear from Disney management, they were incredibly vocal to us about how much they like our brand, how much they admire the programming we did,\u201d Newman said. \n\u201cEvery expectation we have is that they are not acquiring Fox to turn it into some form of a PG company,\u201d he added. \u201cMy expectation is they are going to be encouraging of our content.\u201d \n\u201cFamily Guy\u201d creator Seth MacFarlane, who also said he received a call from Iger, shrugged off the pending acquisition. \u201cThis kind of stuff happens often now,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything will change that much.\u201d Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by David Gregorio"}

He stammered, he hesitated, and he was obviously uncomfortable on stage. Part of his discomfort could probably be explained by AT&T 's last-minute decision to pull out of a deal to sell Huawei's phones in the US . This was supposed to be Huawei's big moment in the American spotlight, and AT&T pulled the rug out from under the Chinese company.\nReports indicate that the carrier's decision was driven by political pressure within the US, with apparent concern about Chinese espionage \u2014 and Huawei's particular role in that \u2014 underlying the whole thing.\nThe Huawei boss did something unexpected at the end of his keynote, however. Framed by a simple slide reading \"Something I Want to Share,\" Yu proceeded to address the failure of Huawei's carrier deal directly. Shedding the earlier hesitation in his speech, he made the point that American phone buyers can't have the best and widest choice of device if Huawei products \u2014 those of the world's third-biggest phone vendor \u2014 weren't on offer. \"Everybody knows that in the US market that over 90 percent of smartphones are sold by carrier channels,\" he said. \"It's a big loss for us, and also for carriers, but the more big loss is for consumers, because consumers don't have the best choice.\"\nHarkening back to the beginning of his Huawei career 25 years ago, Yu radiated a quiet anger at the mistrust his company is being subjected to. He said Huawei faced plenty of doubters in its native China too, being an almost total newcomer to consumer devices six years ago. \"We win the trust of the Chinese carriers, we win the trust of the emerging markets... and also we win the trust of the global carriers, all the European and Japanese carriers,\" he said. \"We are serving over 70 million people worldwide. We've proven our quality, we've proven our privacy and security protection.\"\nI craned my neck to look at the teleprompters behind me and they were blank. Yu's most inspired and most eloquent speech, it turned out, was being delivered without any external help. It might have been just another clumsy presentation, but at the end of it, a little bit of genuine passion came to the surface. And now I'm starting to think every tech keynote should be led by a mildly simmering CEO.\nMore from The Verge:\nThis $16,000 robot uses artificial intelligence to sort and fold laundry\nSteelSeries' new Rival 600 gaming mouse tracks your movements in mid-air\nIntel needs to come clean about Meltdown and Spectre"}

FILE PHOTO - Atletico Madrid's soccer player Diego Costa listens to a reporter's question at Wanda Metropolitano stadium in Madrid, Spain, December 31, 2017. REUTERS\/Susana Vera \nAtletico may be second in the standings but they have badly missed Costa\u2019s energy and determination as their forwards have all underperformed: talisman Antoine Griezmann has only scored five league goals while Kevin Gameiro and Angel Correa have struggled for consistency. \nCosta needed only five minutes as a substitute against Lleida Esportiu in the King\u2019s Cup on Wednesday to make an impact on his return to Atletico, scoring the third goal in a 4-0 thrashing and giving his side some badly needed aggression and pace in attack. \nThe Spain international, who rejoined the club for $77 million (\u00a356.88 million), even shrugged off a bleeding shin. After taking a moment to rest on the sidelines, he was back in the thick of the action as if nothing had happened. \n\u201cIn one sense Costa never left us,\u201d said Atletico goalkeeper Miguel Angel Moya. \n\u201cHe had a very good spell at Chelsea and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s changed how he is or how he plays, we expect everything of him.\u201d \nAtletico coach Diego Simeone added: \u201cCosta generates enthusiasm. In those first five minutes he showed what he is all about and I hope he can keep it up.\u201d \nThe man who enraptured the Vicente Calderon with his combative and ruthlessly effective displays is now set for his baptism at Atletico\u2019s new home, the 68,000 capacity Wanda Metropolitano, and he could hardly have hoped for more fitting opponents in his first game back in La Liga than Getafe. \nCosta scored a stunning goal in a 7-0 thrashing of Getafe in November 2013 during Atletico\u2019s remarkable title winning campaign. He also scored in the 2-0 away win against the Madrid side in April 2014, banging his shin against the post in the process. \nHe had to be carried off the pitch on a stretcher but immediately after that game Atletico coach Simeone summed up Costa attitude, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s fine, one more scratch won\u2019t hurt this tiger\u201d. \nBarca, who lead Atletico in the standings by nine points and are still buzzing from their impressive 3-0 win over Real Madrid before the Christmas break, host struggling Levante on Sunday. They will be boosted by the return of club record signing Ousmane Dembele from a long injury spell. \nChampions Real Madrid are 14 points behind Barca and will look to kickstart their season away to Celta Vigo on Sunday, while Sevilla\u2019s new coach Vincenzo Montella faces a baptism of fire in his first game in La Liga on Saturday as his side host fierce city rivals Real Betis.

In 2016, another panel tossed out two majority black congressional districts initially drawn in 2011, saying there was no justification for using race as the predominant factor in forming them. The redrawn map was the basis for a new round of lawsuits.\nThe latest lawsuit \u2014 filed by election advocacy groups and Democrats \u2014 said the replacement to the racial gerrymander also were unlawful partisan gerrymanders. Those who sued argued that Republican legislators went too far when they followed criteria designed to retain the party's 10-3 majority.\nAt the time of debate, according to the order, House redistricting chief Rep. David Lewis attempted to justify the criteria by saying during debate that \"I think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats. So I drew this map to help foster what I think is better for the country.\"\n\"We find that the General Assembly drew and enacted the 2016 plan with intent to subordinate the interests of non-Republican voters and entrench Republican control of North Carolina's congressional delegation,\" U.S. Circuit Court Judge Jim Wynn wrote in the majority opinion. Wynn added that the evidence shows the \"plan achieved the General Assembly's discriminatory partisan objective.\"\nIn their ruling Tuesday, the judges ordered the General Assembly to approve another set of districts by Jan. 24. Candidate filing for the November congressional elections begin Feb. 12. A majority of the judges also agreed they would also hire a redistricting expert to draw replacement boundaries if the legislature won't.\nThrough a spokeswoman, one of the legislative defendants, Sen. Ralph Hise of Mitchell County, said lawmakers plan to appeal.\nThere's a good chance Republicans will try to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to block the ruling's enforcement until the justices rule in a similar case they heard from Wisconsin in the fall. But that case involves legislative districts, not a congressional plan."}

LNG imports alone surged more than 50 percent.\nThe data, which includes LNG tanker arrivals to China and pipeline monthly import flow estimates, is preliminary as December figures are not yet available.\nChina still lags Japan, with gas annual imports of around 83.5 million tonnes, all as LNG, but its overall gas imports topped Japan\u2019s in September and again in November, government data and shipping flows show.\nAnalysts say the trend is set and China should top Japan for the full year in 2018.\n\u201cBoth LNG and pipeline imports will continue to increase in the next few years. We expect China to overtake Japan as the world\u2019s largest gas importer in 2018,\u201d said Miaoru Huang, Asia gas and LNG senior manager at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.\n\u201cBut Japan will remain as the No.1 LNG importer till around 2028,\u201d she added.\nChina last year started to move millions of households and many industrial facilities from coal to gas as part of efforts to clean its skies, sparking an unprecedented rally in overseas import orders.\nChina\u2019s three biggest LNG suppliers are Australia, Qatar and Malaysia, while pipeline imports come from Central Asia and Myanmar. A pipeline connecting China to Russia is under construction.\nUnlike established LNG importers which import the bulk of their cargoes under long-term contracts with fixed monthly volumes and a link to the oil market, many Chinese utilities buy LNG in the spot market when they need it at short notice, such as the current peak demand winter season.\nAs a result, Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have more than doubled since June to $11.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their highest since November 2014, making LNG one of 2017\u2019s strongest performing commodities.\nChina\u2019s surging demand already pushed it past South Korea in 2017 as the world\u2019s number 2 LNG importer.\nReporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin\n "}

It was not immediately known if they would appeal against the ruling. \nNorway is Western Europe\u2019s largest producer and exporter of oil and gas and plans to keep pumping for decades despite its support for the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to end the fossil fuel era this century. \nWhile Norway\u2019s output from the Arctic remains small, the region is believed to hold the greatest potential for new discoveries that could gradually replace production from rapidly maturing North Sea and Norwegian Sea fields. \nThe government\u2019s lawyers had argued that the case was a publicity stunt that would cost jobs if it was successful. \nThe court said that any production from future Arctic fields would not start for 10-15 years, by which time a new management plan for the northern region would almost certainly be in place. \nAnd it said government and parliament had taken proper account of how the ice in the Arctic region was retreating because of global warming. Environmentalists say a cold year could bring ice back to the region. \nThe legal action was part of an emerging branch of law worldwide in which plaintiffs invoke a nation\u2019s founding principles in a bid to bring about policy change to limit global warming. \nDuring the hearing in late 2017, the government said it was inappropriate to invoke the constitution rather than focus on taxes and regulations to control greenhouse gases. \nThe Norwegian oil industry lobby group welcomed the decision. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve previously said that this is a matter of politics, and politics should be made in parliament, not in the court,\u201d said Tommy Hansen, a spokesman for the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association. \nAmong firms winning stakes in 10 licenses awarded in Norway\u2019s 23rd round of awards were Lukoil, ConocoPhillips, Lundin, Aker BP, OMV, Centrica, Idemitsu and others. \n($1 = 8.0907 Norwegian crowns)"}
{"published":"2018-01-18T23:56:00.000+02:00","title":"This start-up founder has a novel strategy for getting ahead: Telling the truth","text":"Ethan Perlstein, founder of Perlara, shares his biotech fundraising tips \nFirst-time entrepreneur Ethan Perlstein has a unique strategy to get ahead: Telling the truth. \n\"To beat me, any potential rivals would have to out-transparency me,\" said Perlstein, in an interview with CNBC. \"And that's anathema to the status quo.\" \nPerlstein's approach with his start-up, Perlara , which is working with families to find cures for rare diseases, is radically different from how most start-ups operate. \nInvestors and boards typically pressure start-ups to stay quiet. A lot of entrepreneurs also believe that secrecy will help them quietly sneak up on incumbents. Plus, it can be a bit embarrassing to talk about non-existent revenues in the early days of a company. It's a lot easier to win investors by selling a big vision. \nPerlstein wants to start a movement to do just the opposite: Share numbers, share data, share everything. That includes saying what he thinks, even if that means pissing a few people off. (Perlstein almost certainly raised a few eyebrows when he referred to tech investors as little more than \"biocurious,\" while insisting that the best way they could help him is to cut the platitudes and cut him a check). \nTo test out Perlstein's commitment to openness, CNBC shared a handful of questions that would get a polite but firm \"no comment\" from most founders. He shared his responses via email: Perlara booked revenue of $250,000 in 2017 and Perlstein is hoping to secure that amount within the first few months of this year. He believes he's on track. He pays himself a salary of $200,000. His biggest disappointment about a customer falling through? After a \"lot of time\" talking to pharma companies Sanofi and BioMarin, he didn't get a contract. He pitched 75 venture funds last year and about a quarter of them never engaged again after the first meeting. Fund-raising was an \"emotional rollercoaster\" that became particularly stressful when it became clear his company wasn't going to get an institutional lead investor and its runway was shrinking. It was \"the most challenging experience of my professional life so far.\" His goal for 2018 is to be profitable. To do that, he'd need to make 2017's revenues in the first few months of this year. \nPerlara has raised just shy of $10 million in venture capital since its 2014 inception. It is a graduate of one of Silicon Valley's most competitive accelerator programs, Y Combinator. Not everyone agrees... \nIt might seem a little nuts for an early-stage start-up to share these metrics publicly. But Perlstein has his reasons: To help other early-stage entrepreneurs who don't hear enough about their peers' rejections or failures. He noted the \"psychological toll of feeling like an imposter or loser\" and how founders will take the inevitable rejections and mistakes very hard, if they don't believe others are experiencing them also. To battle the \"old boys' club\" in Silicon Valley and in biotech, where the same sorts of people get funding each year by benefiting from exclusives networks. He has a personal passion for transparency and sharing. \nWhile his approach might seem admirable, not everyone agrees that it's the right thing to do. \n\"Things could change for a start-up from month-to-month,\" said Steve Kraus, a health and technology investor with Bessemer Venture Partners. One big customer win or loss could change things, and make last week's numbers irrelevant. So it might be advisable to never share them in the first place. \nKraus is also skeptical that it will give Perlara a competitive edge. \n\"And as for getting an edge for transparency, I'm not so sure about that,\" he added. In pharma, said Kraus, sharing data might open up a company to more competition from incumbents, who could then deliver a better, faster product. \nOthers believe there's a middle ground between Perlara's total transparency and the prevailing culture of secrecy. Evidation Health's Christine Lemke, who is also an angel investor, said her start-up makes it a policy to share as much as they can with potential recruits. Evidation works with other health start-ups to help them generate evidence to back-up their claims. \nBut getting approval to share revenues publicly would be another story. \nAnd she wonders whether companies would regret taking that approach if their company goes through a bad patch. \n\"I bet that transparency goes away if your revenue takes a nosedive,\" she said.

At the same time, they also have focused on building relationships with residents. \nThe trend follows a two-year uptick in homicides and a broader nationwide decline in crime from the 1990s to the early 2010s.

Spokeswoman Erin Curtis called it the first step in what would likely be an 18-month analysis.\nThe water project is a network of 18 dams and reservoirs and 500 miles of canals and aqueducts that draw water from the delta of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, which are part of the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Americas.\nLaunched in the 1930s, the water project has helped make California's Central Valley the United States' richest farm region. It also has contributed to driving several once-plentiful species of smelt, salmon and other native animals toward extinction, biologists and environmental groups say.\nDoug Obegi, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental group, contended in an email Friday the move represented \"the latest attempt by the Trump administration to roll back protections for salmon and other endangered native fisheries ... in order to increase water supplies\" for the state's agricultural water agencies.\nCurtis, the Reclamation spokeswoman, called the effort a priority for the current administration.\nCutbacks of water deliveries for the project's customers during the recently ended five-year California drought \u2014 including cutbacks prompted by rules protecting endangered native species also struggling in the drought \u2014 helped prompt the decision to look at possibly redoing the rules for operating the water project, Curtis said.\nSo did new U.S. legislation last year that encouraged more big water construction projects and water deliveries for Western farmers, Curtis said.\nFederal authorities will seek public comment through Feb. 1."}

The Fed will publish its policy statement on Wednesday following a two-day meeting. Some economists expect it to raise its economic assessment, which would strengthen expectations of the U.S. central bank raising interest rates four times this year. Higher U.S. rates could weigh on demand for emerging market assets, which typically offer higher yields. Traders also avoided risky assets ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address later on Tuesday. \"Trade, immigration, and infrastructure are the most highly anticipated areas of focus. Foreign policy will also be closely scrutinized as market participants look to comments on North Korea, Iran, and potentially Russia,\" analysts at Scotiabank wrote in a client note. Currencies from Brazil, Mexico and Colombia weakened between 0.08 and 0.83 percent. Stocks fell in the region in the wake of the risk-aversion, with MSCI's Latin American index down 0.78 percent. In Brazil, Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles said economic reforms, reduction of the state's presence in the economy and higher productivity may boost the country's growth rate to between 3.5 percent and 4 percent. Mexico's economy, meanwhile, grew around 1.0 percent in seasonally adjusted terms in the fourth quarter, according to preliminary government data released on Tuesday. The uptick surpassed an earlier Reuters poll that forecast an expansion of 0.6 percent.

Just because they were expecting the money on the first, and they did not get it at that time, does not mean it was suspended or cancelled. Deliberations are ongoing, and we have until mid-January to make a final decision.\u201d \nAsked if any preliminary decision had been made, the official replied: \u201cNo. And reports to that effect are false.\u201d \nUNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness said the agency had not been \u201cinformed directly of a formal decision either way by the U.S. administration.\u201d \nTrump said on Tuesday he would withhold money from the Palestinians, accusing them of being \u201cno longer willing to talk peace\u201d with Israel. \n\u201dWe pay HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect.

{"published":"2018-01-16T19:30:00.000+02:00","title":"The winners and losers of the Detroit Auto Show","text":"The winners and losers of the Detroit Auto Show SHARES CNBC breaks down the winning and losing cars of the Detroit Auto Show. We saw new trucks, concepts and sedans, and then picked the ones we like most. Here's what has the most potential in 2018, and here's what doesn't. \nI'm here at the Detroit Auto Show scouring the show floor for the big winners and losers this year. There have been plenty of announcements, ranging from new sedans to pick-up trucks. Here's what I think are the most, and least, compelling of the show. Winner: Ram 1500 Mack Hogan | CNBC The Ram 1500 \nFiat Chrysler took the wraps off of an all-new version of the company's high-volume, high-profit Ram 1500 early Monday in Detroit. The truck boasts a variety of improvements over the outgoing model, including a new 48-volt mild hybrid assist. \nThe mild hybrid system allows the Ram to recapture kinetic energy during braking and use it to assist the engine during acceleration, just like the regenerative brakes in traditional hybrid cars. The electric assist not only boosts fuel economy figures by 10 percent, according to Ram, but also contributes to a 20-percent increase in towing capacity. \nLuxury trims of the Ram are also offered with a 12-inch, tablet style center display reminiscent of the ones you would find in a Tesla, but flanked by physical controls for mission-critical functions like climate controls. Loser: Chevy Silverado Mack Hogan | CNBC The Chevy Silverado 1500 \nThe 2019 Silverado is by no means a bad or even unimpressive truck; on the contrary, it's easily one of the most exciting new half-ton trucks we've seen in some time. So why's it on the losers list? What happened? \nRam happened. The Ram 1500 debuted just two days after the Silverado, but its mild hybrid system was more exciting and innovative than the Silverado's new and improved cylinder deactivation. The Ram also upstaged the Silverado in the interior department, and the exterior design is fresher. \nEven the Chevy's power tailgate, which was called \"class-exclusive,\" only held onto that distinction for two days. I'm sure the Silverado will make a great truck, but poor press conference timing and the Ram's sucker-punch means that the Silverado has to be on the loser's list for Detroit. Winner: BMW X2 Mack Hogan | CNBC The BMW X2 \nThe BMW X2 is the perfect car for 2018. People want crossovers. But more than that, they want raked-back crossovers that sacrifice a lot of the utility of a conventional SUV. And of course, people want those raked-back crossovers to be made by a luxury marque and more expensive than the traditional crossover on which the raked-coupe one is based. I truly don't know why, but cars that meet these criteria fly off of dealer lot and sell near sticker price every time. \nThe X2 checks all of those boxes and more. It looks great, it's efficient and it manages to keep enough practicality that it won't be unusable in the real world. It also shares a significant amount of its underpinnings with the X1 but is expected to cost more, so it'll drive high profits for the Bavarian brand. Loser: Mini Cooper Hardtop Mack Hogan | CNBC The Mini Cooper Hardtop \nIf the X2 is everything consumers demand in 2018, the new Mini Cooper Hardtop is everything they don't care about. It's a small car from a non-premium brand, for starters. If history is our lesson, it'll also cost more than its competitors when similarly equipped and won't come with standard features people are looking for. \nSure, it's cute and comes with LED taillights in the shape of the British flag, but I'm not sure that's enough to get people to care about Minis again. Winner: Mercedes G-Class Mack Hogan | CNBC The Mercedes G Class \nThe iconic G-Class, which survived 39 years without a full overhaul, finally got its makeover in time for the Detroit show. A few parts carry over from the old model, but it's larger and more luxurious to accommodate the truck's increasing favor among the Beverly Hills elite. \nMercedes improved a lot of things that people have hated about the G-Class without ruining the things people love. It still has off-road credo, it still sports a V8 engine and it still has the refrigerator-box shape that has defined the G-Class. But also has an improved better interior, a more refined ride and more space for passengers than its predecessor. Loser: BMW i8 coupe Mack Hogan | CNBC The BMW i8 Coupe \nBMW also rolled out the updated 2019 i8 coupe. Like the new convertible that debuted at the Los Angeles Show, the 2019 i8 coupe has increased electric range and more power on tap. It's an improvement in every way. \nIt's not enough. Mercedes was able to make small improvements because the G-Class is still posting massive sales and bringing in lots of money. The i8, on the other hand, was exciting when it first came out but the hype quickly faded. The 2019 model doesn't change enough to bring the hype back. Winner: Hyundai Veloster Mack Hogan | CNBC The Hyundai Veloster \nModern cars are so capable and high-quality across the board that consumers are focusing on style more than ever. The Veloster looks great, is offered with a high-performance model, and is priced well to court younger buyers. Loser: Kia Forte Mack Hogan | CNBC The Kia Forte \nThe Forte doesn't move the needle enough. It's a safe play and a nice looking vehicle, but in a crowded segment with less sales to go around every year, it's not exciting enough to do much good for Kia. \nIt's a safe play and a nice-looking vehicle, but in a crowded segment. If you want a small vehicle from Kia, it's hard to imagine why you'd get a Forte over something a bit more fun like the Soul. Winner: Lexus LF-1 Limitless Concept Mack Hogan | CNBC The Lexus F-1 Limitless \nLexus needs two things: more crossovers, and a truly inspirational flagship. The LF-1 is the first thing Lexus has that can solve both problems. \nUnlike BMW, which offers five crossovers with two more on the way in 2018, Lexus currently offers just two. A three-row edition of the RX is a great start, but a Range Rover-fighting two-row SUV is a fantastic choice to elevate the brand's image. Loser: Toyota Avalon Mack Hogan | CNBC The Toyota Avalon \nPeople who want a lot of space want SUVs. The 2019 Avalon is a valiant effort towards reversing trends in a shrinking segment, but the biggest advantage sedans have over SUVs is dynamics. Typically, this is not where the Avalon shines. \nFor a select group of people, the Avalon will be a great choice. But Toyota failed to address the bigger problem: no one's going to get excited about an Avalon. The most anyone is saying about the revised model is that it'll be the first Toyota to offer Apple CarPlay, but that's less of an exciting development and more of a \"gee, it sure took you long enough\" moment."}

The White House proposal would limit family sponsorship and eliminate the visa lottery system, although it would reallocate those visas. \n\u201cWe cannot support arbitrary cuts to future legal immigration levels,\u201d said Daniel Garza, president of The LIBRE Initiative, which is backed by the Koch brothers. \u201cWe welcome a debate about whether our current legal immigration policy properly balances family and skills-based migration. But that broad debate should not distract from the immediate goal of providing certainty to Dreamers and enhancing security.\u201d \nJorge Lima, the Executive Director of the LIBRE Initiative, said that in addition to working with both chambers of Congress and the White House on a bill, his organization would mobilize its grassroots efforts to hammer home their principles to elected officials and individual communities. \n\u201cIt\u2019s everything we do \u2014 [communications] grassroots, government affairs, and putting all of that behind the ability to make a difference here,\u201d he said. \nTiming wise, he said it is crucial that Congress pass legislation by March 5, which is when the DACA program, which has provided undocumented immigrants who came to the country as minors with their parents to apply for renewable work permits, will officially expire. (Former President Barack Obama established the program under executive order in 2012, but the Trump administration announced last September it was revoking the order, and that Congress had six months to pass a legislative solution). \n\u201cWe know that come March 5 you\u2019re [going to] have a lot of uncertainty for DREAMers whose status has now thrown into question,\u201d Lima said, noting the disruption would extend beyond the dreamers. \u201cWe\u2019re asking Congress to act as soon as possible before the March 5 deadline.\u201d \nThe network is planning to spend $20 million this year on advocating for the tax reform bill Trump signed into law ahead of the midterm elections. Officials said on Saturday in a briefing with reporters that spending on policy and politics could total up to $400 million by the end of 2018. When asked how much money would be spent on immigration advocacy, Lima declined to give a monetary figure, but said the advocacy efforts would be \u201cas big of a deal\u201d as tax reform. \n\u201cIt\u2019s valuable to know the dollar sign but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s less or more critical on the issue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think that now we can make a big deal on this issue and to do that most efficiently and best as we can.\u201d \n(Disclosure: Time Inc., TIME and Fortune\u2019s parent company, has agreed to be acquired by Meredith Corp. in a deal partially financed by Koch Equity Development, a subsidiary of Koch Industries Inc.)

BeyondSpring\u2019s lead asset, Plinabulin, is in a Phase 3 clinical trial as a direct anticancer agent in non-small cell lung cancer (Study 103) and two Phase 2\/3 clinical programs in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) \u2013 Studies 105 and 106. BeyondSpring has a seasoned management team with many years of experience bringing drugs to market.\nAbout Plinabulin\nStudies on Plinabulin's mechanism of action indicate that Plinabulin activates GEF-H1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. GEF-H1 activates downstream transduction pathways leading to the activation of the protein c-Jun. Activated c-Jun enters the nucleus of dendritic cells to upregulate immune-related genes, which contributes to the up-regulation of a series of genes leading to dendritic cell maturation, T-cell activation and other effects that prevent neutropenia. Plinabulin is given as a single IV infusion in each cycle, 30 minutes to 1 hour after completion of the chemotherapy, offering same day dosing, whereas G-CSF is given 24 hours after chemotherapy. In addition, the use of Plinabulin is not associated with bone pain, which is a frequent side effect with G-CSF.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements that are not historical facts.

More gross profit gives Amazon more flexibility to invest in its operations, which allows it to spend more in new areas like international, video, and Alexa. \"We believe continued strength in high margin revenue streams will start to outgrow investments in Video, salesforce, Alexa, and fulfillment centers,\" the note said. Continued strong top-line growth: The company's revenue growth has bounced back to mid-to-high 20 percent in the last two years from closer to 20 percent growth in 2015. That's largely driven by its Prime member growth, Echo device sales, and the broader consumer shift to online shopping. \"Investments will result in increased earnings and cashflow in out years and lead to positive estimate revisions,\" the note said. Growth in under-penetrated and large markets: Amazon will continue to move into new markets, as it did with the acquisition of Whole Foods last year that immediately made the company a major presence the in brick-and-mortar grocery market. \"We see Amazon's immediate addressable US market as $2.5 trillion, but this could expand to $5 trillion if it expands into more markets,\" the note said. \nUnder its $2,000 per share \"bull case\" scenario, which would get Amazon to the $1 trillion market cap milestone, Morgan Stanley estimates the core retail business to be worth $600 billion and the AWS cloud $273 billion.

It wasn\u2019t far away from a four-month high of $1.2092 hit in September.\nThe U.S. currency had begun 2018 on the defensive, after the dollar index fell about 9.9 percent in 2017, its weakest performance since 2003.\nA synchronized global recovery has prompted other countries\u2019 central banks to start moving towards tighter monetary policy in recent months, helping bolster their currencies.\nAfter the U.S. jobs data, traders of U.S. short-term interest rate futures continued to bet the Fed would raise rates two times this year, including a probable increase in March.\nComments by some Fed officials on Friday and over the weekend suggested the U.S. central bank remained on track to raise interest rates in 2018.\nSan Francisco Fed President John Williams told Reuters in an interview on Saturday that the Fed should raise rates three times this year given the already strong economy will get a boost from tax cuts, and can tighten more or less aggressively if needed.\nAgainst a broad-basket of currencies, the dollar edged 0.3 percent higher on the day.\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters:\/\/realtime\/verb=Open\/url=http:\/\/emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz\/cms\/?pageId=livemarkets (Reporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Peter Graff)\n "}

The bacteria can be found in animal products including cold cut meats, poultry and unpasteurised milk, as well as fresh fruits and vegetables.\nThe disease can cause flu-like symptoms and diarrhoea, and in more severe cases spread from the intestine to the blood, causing bloodstream infections, or to the central nervous system, causing meningitis.\nAnelich said a listeriosis strain known as ST6 had been identified in nine out of 10 of the South African cases. That should make tracing the source easier, \u201cbecause now we know that it probably originates from one processing facility\u201d.\nA health department official said the strain was not drug-resistant and that the deaths were due to delays in diagnosis, meaning cases were not treated in time.\nReporting by Mfuneko Toyana; Editing by Kate Kelland and John Stonestreet\n "}

It has exceeded 10 percent in elections since and took 11.9 percent in the November 2015 vote. \nFounded by an ex-colonel involved in a 1960 military coup, the MHP espouses a mix of Turkish nationalism and scepticism toward the West.

Financial markets are rather nervous it seems to me: when parliament dissolved the (German-Italian 10-year bond yield) spread widened.\u201d \nLeft and right parties in have supported each other in power previously. \nBoosted in recent years by the European Central Bank\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy, Italian government bonds are seen vulnerable to political risks as the ECB started scaling down its bond purchases. \nParties across the spectrum are pledging to voters that they will change or abolish European Union budget rules, cut taxes and spend more to boost the economy which is slowly picking up steam. \nPD, the party of former prime minister Matteo Renzi, and FI, led by 81-year-old,four-times prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, hold the most moderate positions. \nAsked about proposals to introduce a single income tax rate, Padoan said the 15 percent rates suggested by the regional and sometimes secessionist Northern League was not sustainable, while Berlusconi\u2019s 20 percent suggestion was \u201cless unsustainable.\u201d \n\u201cI would explore a tax reform that would simplify the tax rates reducing them to one or, better, two.

(NYSE: EVH) (\"Evolent\"), a company providing an integrated value-based care platform to the nation's leading health systems and physician organizations, today announced the completion of its acquisition of certain assets from New Mexico Health Connections (NMHC). First announced on September 27, 2017, this strategic acquisition brings together two innovative companies that will operate a new health plan and managed services organization called True Health New Mexico.\nThe transaction closed on the originally announced terms, with Evolent acquiring assets related to the commercial business from New Mexico Health Connections (NMHC) for $10.25 million in cash. The assets include a commercial plan and health plan management services organization with a tenured leadership team and employee base with extensive experience working locally with providers to run NMHC's suite of preventive, disease and care management programs. The assets are being contributed to a new entity, True Health New Mexico, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Evolent Health. As of December 31, 2017, the membership in the commercial plan was just under 20,000 members.\nThe legacy NMHC entity expects to continue to operate as an independent non-profit health care organization operating throughout the state of New Mexico, offering individual health insurance products. True Health New Mexico expects to enter into a managed services agreement with NMHC to support this ongoing individual business.\n\"As part of Evolent Health, True Health New Mexico is now positioned as a thriving alternative in the New Mexico commercial market. Working with our physician partners, we will continue to deliver differentiated care to our members and see multiple potential opportunities to grow True Health New Mexico,\" said Dr. Martin Hickey, CEO of True Health New Mexico and the former CEO of NMHC.\nTo provide stability to our provider partners that will be serving our commercial members as well as NMHC's individual members, Evolent expects to extend a 15-month capital-only reinsurance arrangement to NMHC, which is currently expected to be approximately $10 million. Evolent's subsidiary, True Health New Mexico, expects to underwrite the contract. The purpose of capital only reinsurance is to provide balance sheet support to NMHC. There is no transfer of underwriting risk to Evolent or True Health New Mexico, and neither Evolent nor True Health New Mexico are at risk for any cash payments on behalf of NMHC.\nAbout Evolent Health\nEvolent Health partners with leading provider organizations to achieve superior clinical and financial results in value-based care. With a provider heritage and over 20 years of health plan administration experience, Evolent operates in more than 30 U.S. health care markets, actively managing care across Medicare, Medicaid, commercial and self-funded adult and pediatric populations.

Standard Life Aberdeen said all UK and European funds on its platform were compliant by the deadline. \nCharles Stanley and Interactive Investor were not able to immediately confirm whether they had suspended any funds. \nThe suspensions will limit choice for investors, though some analysts say the industry has long been oversupplied, and they mark an embarrassing admission that parts of the investment sector have been too slow to implement major new regulations. \nThe rules took effect on Jan. 1 and require each fund to have a new Key Information Document (KID) available online for investors. The aim is to give information in a standardised format so investors can compare risks and costs across products and providers. \nWith the rules not finalised until September 2017, investment trusts had not had much time to get the relevant information in place, said Ian Sayers, chief executive of trade body The Association of Investment Companies (AIC). \n\u201cSomething that should have had 12 months as a transitional period ended up with a matter of weeks,\u201d he said, adding he expected most funds to comply with the rules relatively quickly. \nThe Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the sector, had no immediate comment. \nMore important, Sayers said, was whether the new information was useful for investors, with projections for future risk and returns coloured by recent strong performance for many funds as a result of easy central bank liquidity that few expect to last. \nThe launch of PRIIPs coincided with an even bigger set of new rules on Jan. 3 - the European Union\u2019s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, or MiFID II - which further complicated the efforts of some to get ready on time. \nThe introduction of MiFID II generally went off without a hitch, the European regulator said on Wednesday, although some participants were given a last-minute waiver. HARGREAVES, BESTINVEST \nHargreaves Lansdown, Britain\u2019s biggest online investment platform, said it had suspended around 1,200 ETFs and 300 investment trusts from its website on Tuesday as they had not supplied the correct KIDs in time. That equates to about a third of ETFs and just under a half of trusts on the platform. \nThe funds remain on the platform, but are not visible on the website and the company said it would not accept any fresh money from either new or existing clients into the funds. \nAround 900 of the ETFs are U.S.-based and Hargreaves spokesman Danny Cox said he did not expect them to ever provide the correct KIDs. The other 300 are Europe-based and would likely provide them over time. \nOf the 300 investment trusts, funds listed on the stock exchange as companies, around 200 are predominantly U.S.-based and not likely to comply, Cox said. \u201cMy understanding is that UK distribution by U.S. domiciled investment trusts and ETFs isn\u2019t a priority for them.\u201d \nOf the remaining 96 investment trusts, the majority are UK-based and Cox, confirming earlier reports, said he expected them to provide the correct information and return to the website. \n\u201cThe situation is moving, 10 are already back on and we are putting investments back onto the website as and when they provide the correct KID,\u201d Cox said. \u201cTo put this into context, the vast majority of Hargreaves Lansdown investors hold UK-domiciled investments and are unaffected by this issue.\u201d \nBestinvest, meanwhile, said it had suspended an unspecified number of investment trusts, including Sanditon Investment Trust, but at least two had since complied with the rules and were now available again. \n\u201cWe are working with our data vendor to identify cases where PRIIP-compliant documentation is not in place and, where this is the case, we have and will temporarily suspend access to dealing in these,\u201d a spokesman for Bestinvest said. \n\u201cThe situation is incredibly fluid as trusts have been rapidly supplying these over the last couple of days.\u201d Additional reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Mark Potter"}

Endeavor also has a stake in ad agency darling Droga5.\nWith its latest acquisition, Endeavor aims to bolster its existing strategy, sponsorship activation and talent management offerings with digital marketing and branding services capabilities, said Mark Shapiro, co-president of WME and IMG, which still exist as independent businesses within Endeavor.\n\u201cAs the business continues to move away from the 30-second spot and into a full-fledged focus on experiences, we want to be fully armed and stand out with a unique platform,\u201d he said. The 160over90 agency \u201ccan enhance the platforms and channels and content that we are creating and producing for our clients, from Hollywood to sports.\u201d\n160over90 handles branding and marketing for a number of colleges, sports teams and brands, including Ferrari, the Indianapolis Colts, the Philadelphia Eagles, UCLA and Under Armour .\nThese are \u201call worlds we know very well,\u201d said Mr. Shapiro.\nEndeavor similarly works with a number of sports teams, universities and brands, but in a different capacity. Endeavor\u2019s offerings span talent management for celebrities and athletes, and experiential marketing and sponsorship strategy for brands. For higher education institutions, Endeavor handles things like ticketing for games and selling sponsorships throughout stadiums and on campuses, as well as merchandising and licensing.\nEndeavor\u2019s and 160over90\u2019s services will complement each other, said Mr. Shapiro. For example, Endeavor, which works with Visa on sponsorship strategy, could \u201cenhance\u201d its current client relationship with the digital and mobile capabilities of 160over90.\nIn addition to using 160over90 to help Endeavor expand its business with professional sports leagues, he said that the agency could \u201ccome in and develop and execute digital marketing programs\u201d for artists, fashion models and athletes that the company represents, among other clients.\n\u201cYou have to really look inside your own walls and figure out where you have gaps or disciplines that need to be enhanced,\u201d he said. \u201cYour failure to do that by organic growth or consolidation will leave you in the dust.\u201d\nThe deal came to the company\u2019s attention initially as an investment opportunity, and quickly turned into an acquisition proposition, he said. It all came together in under 60 days, he added.\nAfter raising a \u201cconsiderable amount of capital,\u201d closely held Endeavor plans to further enhance its existing offerings through \u201cbolt-on acquisitions,\u201d said Mr. Shapiro. Endeavor investors include Fidelity, Sequoia Capital, SoftBank and Tencent, among others."}

McMaster said in a speech last month to the Washington-based Jamestown Foundation that there was already evidence of Russian meddling in Mexican elections set for July.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that this is really a sophisticated effort to polarize democratic societies and pit communities within those societies against each other,\u201d said McMaster in a previously unreported video clip from Dec. 15 that was posted on Twitter by a reporter with Mexican daily newspaper Reforma on Saturday.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen, actually, initial signs of it in the Mexican presidential campaign already,\u201d said McMaster, a former Army general. He did not elaborate in the clip on how Russia was seeking to influence the election.\nReforma published a story on Saturday on the comments, which have since been shared many times on social media.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s senior national security aide added in the clip that the U.S. government was concerned by Russia\u2019s use of advanced cyber tools to push propaganda and disinformation.\nA request for comment sent to McMaster\u2019s office at the White House and a request for comment from the Russian government in Moscow were not immediately returned on Sunday.\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly denied accusations by U.S. intelligence officials and others of interfering in foreign elections.\nIn July, Mexico will elect a new president to succeed Enrique Pena Nieto, who is barred by law from seeking a second six-year term. Congressional seats plus some governors\u2019 races will also be up for grabs.\nAccording to opinion polls, the frontrunner in the presidential contest is the leftist former mayor of Mexico City, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is running on an anti-corruption platform.\nLopez Obrador, a two-time runner-up for the presidency and a divisive figure in Mexican politics for over a decade, is seen by some analysts as the Kremlin\u2019s favorite, given the positive coverage he has received from government-funded media outlets like Sputnik and Russia Today.\nBoth China and Russia are taking an increasing interest in Latin America as the United States, under Trump, has adopted a more protectionist stance and the future of the North America Free Trade Agreement looks uncertain.\nLopez Obrador has been a fierce critic of Pena Nieto\u2019s sweeping energy overhaul, which was favored by U.S. officials and oil companies. He has said he would seek friendly relations with the U.S. government but would demand respect.\nIn 2016, Russia Today\u2019s Spanish-language YouTube channel began running a weekly video blog entitled \u201cThe Battle for Mexico,\u201d hosted by a prominent supporter of Lopez Obrador, according to David Salvo at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, who has written about Russian attempts to influence politics in Latin America.\nPena Nieto\u2019s office and the foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McMaster\u2019s statement.\nSome Mexican political commentators said that there was little reason yet to fear Russian involvement in the election.\n\u201cThe point is that Washington hasn\u2019t provided any solid proof for this,\u201d said Marco Cancino, head of Mexico City-based consultancy Inteligencia Publica.\n\u201cSo far, it\u2019s just speculation.\u201d\nReporting by David Alire Garcia and Noe Torres in Mexico City; Additional reporting by Jeff Mason in Washington and Jack Stubbs in Moscow, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n "}

{"published":"2018-01-18T16:42:00.000+02:00","title":"An overlooked, gutsy way for investors to make huge returns","text":"It hasn't gone unnoticed that 2017 was an exceptionally good year for overseas stock markets. Gains were recorded in virtually every country stock market in the world. Out of more than 120 stock markets I follow, only a few ended down in 2017. If only it could be that simple every year.\nTo expect the same kind of returns for 2018, you'd have to see a continuation of last year's super winning streak across the globe. But there is another way to keep the overseas streak going that's proven historically. You just have to be willing to take a deep dive into poorly performing international stock markets at seemingly terrible times.\nI'm talking about a Dogs of the World strategy. It exists. I discovered it during my hunt to build an international contrarian stock market strategy. Historical data backs up the approach.\nLast year was another one in which the strategy worked . Back in January 2017, the country stock market dogs were Turkey , Italy , Denmark , Ireland and Mexico . These were markets down anywhere from 7 percent to 10 percent in 2016. Here 's how they did for my Dogs of the World strategy in 2017:\nTurkey: 37 percent Denmark: 35 percent Ireland: 29 percent Italy: 29 percent Mexico: 14 percent In fact, if you were to invest in those five dog country ETFs at the very beginning of 2017, you would have made more than 29 percent for the year.\nMy country dogs versus broad global benchmarks Everything has to be compared to a benchmark. Since my international dogs basket of five countries includes both developed and emerging market country ETFs, I thought it also would be wise to compare the returns to a 50\/50 ETF blend of both the broad emerging markets ( EEM ) and broad developed markets ex-U.S. ( EFA ), and annually reset based on gains to maintain a 50\/50 weighting. For 2017 that simple strategy would have returned about 31 percent, slightly beating out my strategy by 2 percent. But does this negate my strategy? No. In fact, in four of the past six years, my dogs strategy has beaten the broad indexes.\nYear Global dogs EFA+EEM 2012 33% 19% 2013 7.50% 9% 2014 2.50% (-5%) 2015 14% (-8.5) 2016 32% 6% 2017 29% 31% Mitch Goldberg, ClientFirst Strategy In the two years my strategy lost out to the broad benchmark, it was by relatively small amounts. When it beat the benchmarks, it was by relatively large amounts. And the overall average was handily above and beyond. Plus, in the two losing years, returns were still attractive compared to the blended benchmark.\nOn a cumulative basis, the bottom 5 reformulated every year compared to the two benchmarks individually, again beating EEM and EFA. So what's the catch?\nThere's no catch, but there is a footnote to the research: I don't include every single country market for which there is an ETF. I follow most of the country ETFs, but for the global dogs strategy, I isolate approximately 50 single-country stock market indices that have corresponding iShares ETFs with at least a five-year trading history. Excluded markets include Qatar, UAE and Saudi Arabia. I also delete the country ETFs that are currency-hedged.\nMore from Global Investing Hot Spots:\nChina private fund assets hit staggering $1.63 trillion\nVanguard Group: There is now a 70 percent chance of correction\nThe last stock boom left that doesn't make big bets on the internet\nI back-test how I would have done if I invested in a range of global dog strategies \u2014 the 10-worst, five-worst, three-worst or single-worst country) in every year.\nIf you invested in the bottom five annual performers from the previous year \u2014 every year since going back to 2011 \u2014 the process was repeatable and delivered alpha over the averaged two standard international benchmarks.\nIn fact, if you had invested in only the second-to-worst country starting in 2011 \u2014 rather than the five worst \u2014 a $100,000 investment would turn into $378,000 (assuming reinvestment of the full amount each year over a five-year period through 2017). That was the biggest winner of all among potential Dogs of the World strategy options.\nI decided to create a portfolio of the bottom five single countries because this selection outperformed the bottom 10, and one country, or even three countries, just isn't enough for my taste when it comes to international diversification.\nHere are the Dogs of the World 2018 So here are the world's worst markets in 2017 based on my research criteria, and keep in mind that in a year of \"synchronized global growth,\" the \"worst\" doesn't look as bad as usual \u2014 in fact, all five countries generated healthy returns, just well below booming global benchmarks. These five countries generated a total return of 66 percent last year and an average return of 13 percent.\nETF 2017 return Russia (ERUS) 4% Israel (EIS) 13% Mexico (EWW) 14.50% Canada (EWC) 16% Indonesia (EIDO) 19% Creating a portfolio of 2017's bottom five international markets takes us globetrotting to domiciles that are as controversial as ever. Here are a few important things to consider about the bottom five.\nMexico : This one made an uncommon second-year-in-a-row appearance. We have a high murder rate, an election coming up that may bring about political instability, a very big energy sector, and President Trump continues to express his desire to rip up NAFTA . Canada : This country has a substantial energy sector that has suffered from low energy prices, has been subject to trading disputes with the United States in lumber and aircraft manufacturing, and President Trump continues to express his desire to rip up NAFTA. Russia : This one is the most controversial of the five. Between the independent counsel's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, economic penalties due to its invasion of Crimea and its energy-dependent economy, this is a tough one to invest in. Yet of the five global dogs, Russia has started 2018 with the strongest performance. As one of the world's biggest energy exporters, if you believe energy prices are set to continue rising in 2018, this one should do well. Israel : Stuck in the middle of some of the world's most hostile countries to it and the United States, this technologically advanced country over the long term has been a sound place to invest. However, due to geopolitical events, it is often subject to investor selling on fear of war. Indonesia : Southeast Asia's biggest economy isn't exactly doing poorly. It's a bottom 5 country despite a near 20 percent gain last year. If you believe that materials and energy will do well in 2018, this could be a good pick. Oil, natural gas, rubber, plywood, tin and rice are just a few of the products it exports. Yet there are a few things to keep in mind.\nThis strategy is based on back-testing. We all know \u2014 or should know \u2014 the classic investment performance caveat: Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\nThis strategy is deeply contrarian. This is for investors who have a high risk tolerance or for those who allocate only a small portion of their portfolio to it.\nI think it works because investors sold their holdings in these markets when the news was bad, which translates into potential upside when investors realize these countries are probably not going to disappear. In other words, this is a gutsy way to go international, but it's what I'll do because I trust my work and because I feel it's often best to go where others have left.\n\u2014 By Mitch Goldberg, president of ClientFirst Strategy"}

Yet a shutdown could have serious consequences for several of the most important national health agencies , particularly if it drags on for long. \nThe Department of Health and Human Services plans on furloughing just over half of its employees in the event of the looming government shutdown . The HHS contingency staffing plan includes 40,959 employees stopping work, while 40, 956 continue. \nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention plans on sending 63 percent of its 13,600-employee staff home. This threat looms during the height of flu season: The CDC reports that every state but Hawaii and the District of Columbia has suffered widespread flu outbreaks , and officials worry about what may happen without this testing. \nOn Saturday, White House Budget Director Mike Mulvaney told reporters that the CDC will now keep its influenza monitoring program up and running through the shutdown. \nTom Frieden, director of the CDC during the 2013 government shutdown, said recently that he \"really couldn't do my job as CDC director of keeping Americans safe, because more the 8,500 of my staffers had been told to go home, and they do important things that protect Americans.\" \nFrieden told STAT News that the agency made him feel like he was \"in a science fiction movie. CDC was deserted.\" CNBC The FDA is responsible for oversight of medical devices in the U.S. \nThe Food and Drug Administration is expected to retain about 58 percent of its staff. During the 2013 shutdown, FDA inspectors gave up their work phones and couldn't check emails . Because FDA inspectors only audit facilities, food production continued in 2013. \nU.S. Department of Agriculture meat inspectors, however, must be present in every meat-processing facility nationwide. During the last shutdown, USDA inspectors continued to work. \nThe National Institute of Health will keep around 23 percent of its staff on duty. Although patients currently receiving experimental care will remain in these programs, new patients will not be able to enroll in experimental programs. \nAnthony Fauci, the NIH's infectious disease chief, believes the shutdown would mean chaos for scientific researchers. \"It's a scramble,\" Fauci told the Associated Press . \"You can't push the pause button on an experiment when you inject an animal with a particular substance to see what the response is, and then you have to go home for a week.\" \nThe Veterans Health Administration is already funded through the 2018 fiscal year, so VA hospitals will remain open. The agency's public affairs office says 95.5 percent of VA employees will come to work. \nStill, Community health centers face major problems, as money to those programs suffered a major cut in the current budget. Their funding is one of several reasons Democrats have refused to vote in favor of a resolution that would have kept the government open. Modern Medicine"}

Dehaemers Jr., Tallgrass Energy President and Chief Executive Officer. \"With news of increasing crude oil production in basins Pony Express serves, we\u2019re even more confident that utilization of our pipeline will continue to increase in the future.\u201d\nTallgrass Terminals Strategic Acquisitions\nPawnee Terminal\nTallgrass Terminals, LLC (\u201cTallgrass Terminals\u201d) has entered into an agreement to acquire a 51 percent membership interest in the Pawnee, Colo. crude oil terminal (\u201cPawnee Terminal\u201d) from Zenith Energy for approximately $31 million. The Pawnee Terminal is an injection point for the Tallgrass Pony Express Northeast Colorado Lateral (\u201cNECL\u201d), with 300,000 barrels of storage and backed by minimum volume commitments of approximately 90,000 barrels per day. The Pawnee Terminal will provide commercial and operational synergies with Pony Express and offers the potential for incremental sourcing opportunities such as directly connecting nearby producers. Tallgrass Terminals expects the transaction to close in Q1 2018, subject to certain closing conditions.\nDeeprock Development Expansion\nIn addition, Tallgrass Terminals has acquired a 38 percent interest in Deeprock North, LLC (\"Deeprock North\"), which owns a crude oil terminal in North Cushing, Okla., immediately adjacent to the Deeprock Development, LLC (\"Deeprock Development\") crude oil terminal facility. The purchase price for the interest was $19.5 million or approximately eight times current cash flow. Immediately following the acquisition, Deeprock North was merged into Deeprock Development. After the acquisition and merger, Deeprock Development now owns a larger and more diverse terminalling complex with total storage capacity of 4.0 million barrels. Tallgrass Terminals owns approximately 60 percent of the combined entity and retains significant strategic and commercial control. Tallgrass expects the acquisition to enhance and expand Tallgrass Terminals\u2019 commercial offerings for both Pony Express customers and other customers in Cushing.\nPony Express Commercial Updates and Developments\nSuccessful Platteville Extension Open Season\nPony Express recently concluded a successful binding open season to secure committed shipper contracts for crude oil transportation of a new common stream on the Platteville Extension. The open season resulted in additional unaffiliated third-party commitments of 10,000 barrels per day for a total of 37,500 barrels per day of short-haul and long-haul binding transportation commitments. The 55-mile Platteville Extension is approximately 60 percent complete and expected to begin operations in April 2018, with the associated Grasslands Terminal expected to be in service in Q4 2018. The initial capacity of the Platteville Extension will be approximately 40,000 barrels per day, increasing to approximately 80,000 barrels per day once the Grasslands Terminal is in service.\nRecord Volume Throughput Expected in January 2018\nIn late December 2017, Pony Express shippers nominated more than 10 million barrels, or approximately 325,000 barrels per day for movements in January 2018. If realized, this would constitute the largest per-day average during a single month in Pony Express' history. Tallgrass affiliates account for only about 5 percent of the nominated volumes.\nJanuary 2018 In-Service of Two New Refinery Connections Expected\nConstruction on the Holly Frontier El Dorado and CHS McPherson, Kan. refinery connections is complete, with line fill and commercial service expected in early January 2018 for both.\nOnce the two new refinery connections are in service, Pony Express shippers will be able to deliver more than 300,000 barrels per day to three significant refineries directly connected to Pony Express, including the currently connected refinery in Ponca City, Okla.\nNew Supply Connection\nAs previously announced, Tallgrass Terminals has a signed, 10-year take-or-pay agreement for 8,000 barrels per day from a new customer to support the construction of a terminal in the Central Kansas Uplift. Construction of the terminal is progressing on schedule, with completion and in-service expected by March 2018. Upon completion, the terminalling facilities will have delivery capabilities of approximately 20,000 barrels per day into the Pony Express mainline, providing the opportunity to accommodate incremental volumes from the Central Kansas Uplift.\nUpon completion of these projects, Pony Express will have six different supply sources and five different crude oil streams capable of being batched on the system.\n\u201cWe believe the execution of our organically developed commercial projects by Pony Express and Tallgrass Terminals and the expansion of Tallgrass Terminals\u2019 complimentary service offerings through acquisition continue to demonstrate that Pony Express is the most attractive, diverse and capable crude oil transportation and logistics system in the regions in which it operates,\u201d said Matt Sheehy, Tallgrass Energy Chief Commercial Officer. \u201cDiversity of supply and delivery points, multiple batch shipment capability, readily available expansion capacity and an attractive tariff rate solidify Pony Express as a critical part of the country\u2019s crude oil midstream infrastructure.\u201d\nAbout Tallgrass Energy\nTallgrass Energy is a family of companies that includes publicly traded partnerships Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: TEP) and Tallgrass Energy GP, LP (NYSE: TEGP), and privately held Tallgrass Development, LP. Operating across 10 states, Tallgrass is a growth-oriented midstream energy operator with transportation, storage, terminal, water, gathering and processing assets that serve some of the nation\u2019s most prolific crude oil and natural gas basins.\nTo learn more, please visit our website at www.tallgrassenergy.com .\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nDisclosures in this press release contain forward-looking statements.

Ultimately, you want to \" buy the best car that you can afford ,\" says Leno.\nOnce you've settled on one that you can afford, don't lease, he advises. \"I always think it's better to buy a car,\" Leno told CNBC Make It in 2016 . \"Everyone seems to lease now.

Qatar denies the accusation. \nQatari media, including Al Jazeera television, carried a video on Sunday of the silver-bearded Sheikh Abdullah saying that he was being held against his will after coming to Abu Dhabi as a guest. \n\u201cI am now in Abu Dhabi as a guest of Sheikh Mohammed, but actually not in the position of a guest but rather as a detainee,\u201d Sheikh Abdullah said in the recording, apparently referring to Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahayan. \n\u201cI just want to inform you that if anything happens to me, don\u2019t blame Qatar,\u201d he added. \nThe authenticity of the recording could not immediately be verified. \nA UAE Foreign Ministry official said Sheikh Abdullah had come to Abu Dhabi at his own request as a guest after the Qatari government placed restrictions on him. \n\u201cHe is free to move about and has expressed his desire to leave the state, all procedures were facilitated for him without any obstruction,\u201d the official said in a statement carried by the UAE state news agency WAM, giving no details of his destination. \nThe official said the claim that Sheikh Abdullah was being held against his will was \u201clies\u201d, and blamed Qatar. \nQatar said that the lack of contacts with Abu Dhabi made it difficult to be certain what had happened with Sheikh Abdullah, but that it was monitoring the situation. \n\u201cIn principle, the state of Qatar supports maintaining the legal rights of any individual and his family has the right to pursue all legal means to protect his rights,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. \nAli al-Naimi, editor of an online UAE news website who also heads the education department in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, said he had been informed by a reliable source in Abu Dhabi that Sheikh Abdullah had originally moved to the UAE capital, where he has family connections, at his own request, because he feared for his safety in Qatar. \nNaimi said he believed the recording had been fabricated by Qatar. \nSheikh Abdullah emerged as a potential opposition figure after the row over Qatar erupted last June, criticising his cousins in Doha in interviews with Gulf media, and appearing in the company of Saudi officials.

That will put the company ahead of Walmart, which anticipates having its \"Scan & Go\" service at fewer than 200 stores by the end of 2018.\nWith \"Scan, Bag, Go,\" shoppers simply scan bar codes on items they will be purchasing, either with a handheld scanner or via Kroger's smartphone app, as they walk throughout the store.\nSelf-checkout kiosks will await customers at the end of their shopping, where valid coupons have been tallied and a final total is instantly calculated. Eventually, shoppers should be able to bypass those kiosks altogether and pay directly through the app, Kroger has told Business Insider .\nThe process at Walmart looks similar: Using an app, customers will scan items (even produce) on their own as they walk through the store. They will be able to pay on their phones when they're finished. A Mobile Express lane will also be situated at the front of Walmart's stores for those shoppers to walk through, for security purposes, before they leave.\nSource: Walmart Walmart's scan and go technology. The impetus behind these efforts is the idea that many consumers today want a speedy, seamless experience, especially when shopping for grocery items.\nWhile some shoppers are getting comfortable with ordering groceries online, a majority of Americans are still reluctant to do so. Although grocery stores are still vital to many communities, those locations often lack technology upgrades. 2018 could be a year to change that \u2014 or at least start.\nGrocers are under pressure, in an already thin-margin business, to cut costs and make the shopping experience more enjoyable for customers. The front of those stores merits a refresh, where long lines can be slashed and resources can be employed elsewhere.\nAs the cashier ranks dwindle, displaced employees can work other areas of the store, focusing on certain merchandise categories or assisting customers.\nFor now, Amazon Go is still only open to the company's employees in Seattle.

Some states that have already had outbreaks of H3N2 are beginning to see cases of H1N1. \nSo far, influenza B strains have not yet appeared, and Jernigan said it was not too late for people who have not been immunized to benefit from a flu shot.

It came days after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that Pakistan had rewarded past U.S. aid with \u201cnothing but lies & deceit.\u201d \nThe senior Trump administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Washington hoped that the aid suspension would be enough to communicate its concern to Islamabad. \nBut the official cautioned that the freeze was also not the only tool that America had to pressure the country -- suggesting it might resort to other measures, if needed. \n\u201cWe are considering many different things, not just the (financial) assistance issue,\u201d the official said. \n\u201cWe are also looking at Pakistan\u2019s potential response ... and we are looking at ways to deal with that and to mitigate the risks to the relationship.\u201d \nThe official declined to detail what steps were under consideration, including whether that might include possible unilateral U.S. military action against militants in Pakistan. \nBut as Trump allow the U.S. military to again ramp up its war effort in Afghanistan, including with the deployment of more U.S. troops alongside Afghan forces, the official acknowledged a sense of urgency. \nThe United States has long blamed the militant safehavens in Pakistan for prolonging the war in Afghanistan, giving insurgents, including from the Haqqani network, a place to plot attacks and rebuild its forces. \n\u201cWe believe we owe it to the Americans in harms\u2019 way in Afghanistan. We simply can\u2019t ignore the sanctuaries if we are going to make progress in Afghanistan,\u201d the official said. MATTIS PLAYS DOWN CONCERNS \nMattis, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, said he was not concerned about America\u2019s ability to use Pakistan as a gateway to resupply U.S. forces in Afghanistan. \n\u201cI\u2018m not concerned, no,\u201d Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon, adding he had not gotten any indication from Pakistan that it might cut off those routes. Mattis traveled to Pakistan last month. \n\u201cWe\u2019re still working with Pakistan and we would restore the aid if we see decisive movements against the terrorists -- who are as much a threat against Pakistan as they are to us.\u201d \nThe United States has also said some of the frozen aid could be released on a case-by-case basis, and none of it will be spent elsewhere -- leaving the door open to full reconciliation. \nThe Pakistani reaction has so far been limited to harsh rhetoric, with Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif saying the United States was behaving toward Pakistan as \u201ca friend who always betrays.\u201d \nBut opposition leader Imran Khan, a former cricket star tipped as the next Pakistani prime minister, said it was time for Pakistan to \u201cdelink\u201d from the United States. \nThe senior Trump administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity acknowledged that a Pakistani cut-off would greatly complicate U.S. resupply efforts in Afghanistan. \nThe official said the administration was developing \u201crisk mitigation plans,\u201d but acknowledged that examination of a northern network of alternative routes used in the past was \u201cstill at a very broad level.\u201d \n\u201cIf something were to happen to the ground lines of communication or air lines of communication through Pakistan, certainly that would be very difficult for the U.S. and we would have to look for alternatives,\u201d the official said. \n\u201cAnd it would not be easy.\u201d Reporting by Phil Stewart; Additional reporting by Steve Holland, Jonathan Landay and Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Lisa Shumaker"}

Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent, compared to 0.1 percent in November. \n\u201cThe market is shrugging it off because it\u2019s not weak enough to detract the Fed from raising rates further.

The market doesn\u2019t care.

{"published":"2018-01-08T18:21:00.000+02:00","title":"Japanese scientists use artificial intelligence to decode thoughts","text":"Imagine a reality where computers can visualize what you are thinking.\nSound far out? It's now closer to becoming a reality thanks to four scientists at Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan. In late December, Guohua Shen, Tomoyasu Horikawa, Kei Majima and Yukiyasu Kamitani released the results of their recent research on using artificial intelligence to decode thoughts on the scientific platform, BioRxiv .\nMachine learning has previously been used to study brain scans (MRIs, or magnetic resonance imaging) and generate visualizations of what a person is thinking when referring to simple, binary images like black and white letters or simple geographic shapes (as shown in Figure 2 here ).\nBut the scientists from Kyoto developed new techniques of \"decoding\" thoughts using deep neural networks (artificial intelligence). The new technique allows the scientists to decode more sophisticated \"hierarchical\" images, which have multiple layers of color and structure, like a picture of a bird or a man wearing a cowboy hat, for example.\nDeep image reconstruction: Natural images (seen images), GIF version\n\"We have been studying methods to reconstruct or recreate an image a person is seeing just by looking at the person's brain activity,\" Kamitani, one of the scientists, tells CNBC Make It . \"Our previous method was to assume that an image consists of pixels or simple shapes. But it's known that our brain processes visual information hierarchically extracting different levels of features or components of different complexities.\"\nAnd the new AI research allows computers to detect objects, not just binary pixels. \"These neural networks or AI model can be used as a proxy for the hierarchical structure of the human brain,\" Kamitani says.\nDeep image reconstruction: Visual imagery, GIF version\nFor the research, over the course of 10 months, three subjects were shown natural images (like photographs of a bird or a person), artificial geometric shapes and alphabetical letters for varying lengths of time.\nIn some instances, brain activity was measured while a subject was looking at one of 25 images. In other cases, it was logged afterward, when subjects were asked to think of the image they were previously shown.\nOnce the brain activity was scanned, a computer reverse-engineered (or \"decoded\") the information to generate visualizations of a subjects' thoughts.\nThe flowchart, embedded below, is made by the research team at the Kamitani Lab at Kyoto University and breaks down the science of how a visualization is \"decoded.\"\nThe two charts embedded below show the results the computer reconstructed for subjects whose activity was logged while they were looking at natural images and images of letters.\nAs for the subjects' whose brain waves were measured based on remembering the images, the scientists had another breakthrough.\n\"Unlike previous methods, we were able to reconstruct visual imagery a person produced by just thinking of some remembered images,\" Kamitani says.\nAs seen in the chart embedded below, when decoding brain signals resulting from a subject remembering images, the AI system had a harder time reconstructing. That's because it's more difficult for a human to remember an image of a cheetah or a fish exactly as it was seen.\n\"The brain is less activated\" in that scenario, Kamitani explains to CNBC Make It .\nAs the accuracy of the technology continues to improve, the potential applications are mind-boggling. The visualization technology would allow you to draw pictures or make art simply by imagining something; your dreams could be visualized by a computer; the hallucinations of psychiatric patients could be visualized aiding in their care; and brain-machine interfaces may one day allow communication with imagery or thoughts, Kamitani tells CNBC Make It.\nWhile the idea of computers reading your brain may sound positively Jetson-esque, the Japanese researchers aren't alone in their futuristic work to connect the brain with computing power.\nFor example, former GoogleX-er Mary Lou Jepsen is working to build a hat that will make telepathy possible within the decade , and entrepreneur Bryan Johnson is working to build computer chips to implant in the brain to improve neurological functions.\nshow chapters This former GoogleX'er is developing a technology that will make telepathy possible in 8 years 12:06 PM ET Fri, 7 July 2017 | 01:37 See also:\nThis former Google[X] exec is building a high-tech hat that she says will make telepathy possible in 8 years\nAhead of Elon Musk, this self-made millionaire already launched a company to merge your brain with computers\nGoogle billionaire Eric Schmidt: People want dish-washing robots to clean up the kitchen more than any other kind\nshow chapters This CEO wants to put a computer chip in your brain 10:35 AM ET Wed, 12 April 2017 | 01:15 Like this story?

Is it related to President Trump's policies? Look, love him or hate him, the answer is yes,\" Cramer said. \"The president has created a pro-growth environment and along with a new tax code that will take money from the government ... and give it to the corporations.\"\nPresident Donald Trump's Twitter posts echo, if not embolden, this very message. On Sunday, he tweeted:\n\"If the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected, your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day. Now they have a great future - and just beginning!\"\nBut for those in states like New York, New Jersey and California, Cramer said the new tax law (and its alleged burdens on blue states ) might overshadow the market's impressive 2017 gains.\nStill, Cramer argued that individual stock-picking will benefit red- and blue-state investors alike in the new year, particularly in the technology sector.\nAfter brushing off Apple's \"battery gate\" problems as a momentary lapse with an easy fix, Cramer turned to the semiconductor space for investing ideas.\nAfter being under pressure for most of December, semiconductor stocks seem to be revitalized and some of the key contributors to the rally, the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\"The highest multiple tech stocks \u2014 the Adobes , the Salesforces , the VMwares \u2014 are finally on the move after being stuck in the mud,\" he said. \"I think that they're all buys. VMware's really way too low given that blowout quarter .\"\nOil and retail stocks are also coming back to life thanks to rising crude prices and a robust holiday shopping season , respectively, and transports seem to be riding the holiday trend with them as e-commerce grows, Cramer said.\nCommodities are on the come-up, and even biotechnology stocks like Celgene and Gilead caught wind on Tuesday, securing some buyers after a difficult end to 2017 .\n\"I could go on and on,\" Cramer said. \"But the bottom line is simple: for whatever reason, the animal spirits triggered by the president's focus on deregulation , the bonuses being given to workers after the tax cut , the weaker dollar going into the earnings, the boom in the Southeast because of a glut of natural gas , the coming boost in earnings estimates thanks to the slashing of corporate taxes , we've got an incredible rally, and this kind of move is never boring.

FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - Premier League - Liverpool vs Leicester City - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - December 30, 2017 Former Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk before the match REUTERS\/Phil Noble \nThe centre back is eligible to play after his registration was finalised following his protracted 75 million pound move from Southampton. \nManager Juergen Klopp has yet to say whether he intends to plunge the Dutchman straight into action, particularly in such a high-profile game, but Van Dijk is likely to feature at least on the bench. \nThe shape of Klopp\u2019s team is further complicated by British media reports that Barcelona are about to table a bid for Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho. Meanwhile, Mo Salah and Sadio Mane may not feature in Friday\u2019s game after the German agreed to allow them to attend the African Footballer of the Year awards in Ghana on Thursday. \nA private plane will fly them back with Klopp seemingly relaxed about the unusual arrangements. \u201cWe have two of the three best African players in our squad. We have to show them respect. We are going to sleep in a hotel the night before the match, they are going to sleep on a plane. That is the only difference,\u201d he said. \nWith Manchester City so far ahead in the Premier League, the FA Cup, which Liverpool last won in 2006, may represent Klopp\u2019s best chance of winning his first trophy at the club, although Everton always represent a formidable barrier. Last month they drew 1-1 at Anfield and have never lost a cup tie against their neighbours there. \nAll four previous Anfield derbies in the FA Cup, stretching back 116 years, have been drawn, most recently 1-1 in 2009 when Everton won the replay. VAR TECHNOLOGY \nFriday\u2019s other tie pits 2016 champions Manchester United against Derby County, who are second in the Championship, while neighbours City play Burnley on Saturday. \nTo the dismay of purists, the draw has been staggered over four days with Monday\u2019s final game between Brighton & Hove Albion and Crystal Palace marking the first time video assistant referee (VAR) will be used in a major English game. \nThe technology will be restricted to three \u201cgame-changing\u201d situations -- goals, penalties and straight red cards -- at a time when referees have been criticised for getting high-profile decisions wrong. \nLast week in the league, Arsenal were on the wrong end of a harsh handball penalty decision which led to a late equaliser for West Bromwich Albion. The FA Cup holders will be hoping for better luck when they begin their defence of a competition they have won three times in the past four years at managerless Nottingham Forest on Sunday. \nShrewsbury are among the lower division teams scenting a traditional third-round upset against higher-ranked opponents. The Shrews, who sit second in the third-tier League One, face a West Ham United side prioritising top-tier survival and playing their third game in six days. \nAnother Premier League struggler, West Brom, may be troubled at League Two side Exeter City while last season\u2019s losing finalists Chelsea travel to Norwich City from the Championship. \nUnusually, no non-league teams have made it through to the third round but the draw has pitted several players against their former teams. \nThe best known is Leicester City\u2019s Jamie Vardy, who returns to Fleetwood Town, who were a non-league side when the striker left them in 2012 after scoring 31 goals in 36 games. \nFleetwood, who are now managed by former Manchester City striker Uwe Rosler, have progressed in his absence and are now 12th in League One. \nPerhaps the third-round\u2019s biggest cheer will be heard at Brentford\u2019s Griffin Park where Republic of Ireland international Alan Judge is slated for his first game in 21 months, against his former side Notts County. \nThe midfielder has not played since breaking his leg in three places against Ipswich Town in April 2016 but has been told by manager Dean Smith that, after appearing on the Brentford bench for a couple of games, he will play on Saturday. \nJudge\u2019s horrific injury required two operations to heal and deprived the 29-year-old of the chance to appear at Euro 2016 and a likely Premier League move. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t watch football for a year,\u201d he said ahead of his comeback. \u201cI watched little bits here or there, but I didn\u2019t watch Brentford play for over a year, until I knew I was getting fit and I knew I was getting back\u201d. \nOn Saturday, the long wait will be over.

So, we need to take care of (that water),\u201d Zapata, who oversaw the project, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview.\nThe western ranges of the \u201cbrown\u201d Andes - with a marked dry season - are dotted with remains of ancient infrastructures dedicated to managing water, said Jorge Recharte, director of TMI\u2019s Andes program.\nThe ranges extend to Bolivia, Chile and Argentina and while some water structures are still in use, knowledge and understanding of them had started to vanish as populations dwindled due to migration to the cities, Recharte said.\nPeru\u2019s glaciers are a source of fresh water for millions of people but they have diminished by 40 percent since the 1970s, government figures showed.\nThe South American country is home to 70 percent of the world\u2019s tropical glaciers, which are \u201cespecially sensitive to warming temperatures\u201d, the United Nations warned.\nFears over the melting of an Andean glacier has even led to an intercontinental lawsuit that environmentalists are watching closely.\n\u201cAs glacier retreat progresses and climate change kicks in... new lands are becoming available for agriculture in the Andes,\u201d said Alexander Herrera, an archaeologist and associate professor at Colombia\u2019s Universidad de los Andes.\n\u201cLearning from the past is absolutely crucial for sustainable, low-risk, productive agriculture (of the kind) the Andes have had for thousands of years,\u201d said Herrera, who was involved in the Canchayllo and Miraflores projects.\nGREY AND GREEN Peru has a long history of embarking on engineering feats to manage the flow of water for agriculture.\nThe Incas and the civilizations before them built terraces, cisterns and canals while modern government projects include the $500-million Olmos and the stalled Chavimochic III irrigation projects.\nIt was at one of the first meetings TMI organized in 2013 that locals raised the possibility of rehabilitating the neglected pre-Inca hydraulic structures.\nDesigned to slow the movement of water through grasses and soils, they replenished aquifers and springs and helped the grasslands retain more water, allowing biodiversity to flourish.\nThis way, the ecosystem acted as a buffer against flooding and drought and provided fodder for their animals, who in turn produce cheese and importantly manure, used to cultivate \u201cthousands of native potato, corn, tuber and grain varieties\u201d, Zapata said.\nThe restoration and adaptation of ancient terraces and canals for modern use has been pioneered by British archaeologist Ann Kendall since the late 1970s.\nBut other attempts by Andean governments and aid groups in the 1980s to revive these technologies for development failed because the focus was more on techniques and less on the needs of the locals, said archaeologist Herrera.\nIn Canchayllo and Miraflores, the restoration has combined ancient and modern technologies to meet the demands of herders, after months of consultation.\nThe restored systems incorporate \u201cgrey\u201d infrastructure such as PVC pipes, water valves and fences and \u201cgreen\u201d elements such as restoration of grasslands and wetlands.\nThe restoration minimized the need for regular maintenance work since labor is in short supply, with the young and able moving to cities for better jobs.\n\u201cIt is not enough to just improve their infrastructure or water availability. If people are not organized to manage the infrastructure, it will collapse sooner or later,\u201d Zapata said.\nNOT ANOTHER BURDEN Julio Postigo, a Peruvian expert on pastoralism in high altitudes, said poor, marginalized communities needed support from government to revive the ancient structures - just as families were supported centuries ago.\n\u201cWe tend to forget, when we romanticizes these Inca or pre-Inca or ancient responses, that they were never taken by individual families,\u201d said Postigo, a senior research scientist at the University of Chicago\u2019s National Opinion Research Center.\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about an empire that decided that that infrastructure was going to be built.\u201d\nTMI said it was looking to train and work with the Peruvian government and other organizations to replicate the success of projects in central Peru.\nBut reviving ancient water systems must be part of a wider plan to help communities cope with climate change, said Postigo.\n\u201cThe people most vulnerable to climate change effects are those who are poorer, less educated, more marginal, indigenous,\u201d he said in a phone interview.\n\u201cWe should fight poverty and improve living conditions. In doing so, those populations will be on a better foot to respond to climate change.\u201d\nReporting By Thin Lei Win, Editing by Ros Russell; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, corruption and climate change.

We\u2019re approaching Hollywood awards season, and while all eyes may be on the Golden Globes this Sunday, it\u2019s really just a warm-up for THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR. You may recall earlier this week, President Trump announced the inaugural celebration on Twitter , which is due to take place on Monday. Stephen Colbert is so keen for a \u201cFakies\u201d accolade, he\u2019s even taken out a billboard in Times Square in a bid to get nominated by POTUS in all categories. The Hollywood Reporter has more on the CBS late-night host\u2019s campaign .\nFumble The final scores are in. The average audience for NFL games in the recently completed regular season was 14.9 million, down 9.7% from a year ago , The Wall Street Journal reports, citing Nielsen figures. That\u2019s a steeper decline than last year\u2019s 8% viewership erosion. As we\u2019ve covered in this newsletter, there are plenty of theories for the ratings dip, including too many games across too many days, blowback from anthem protests, and football simply being hit by the same viewing declines that are affecting the broader TV business. All that considered, football remains one of the most attractive draws on television for advertisers, with NFL programming accounting for 33 of the top 50 programs in 2017, the league said. That demand has helped keep ad rates high. As Ad Age reported earlier this week, estimates from Standard Media Index suggest overall in-game NFL ad sales revenue was up 2% from last year .\nFetch Me an Uber CMO Today\u2019s Alex Bruell reports : There\u2019s a new twist in the ongoing fight between Uber and mobile ad agency Fetch. Uber had sued Fetch in September for breach of contract, alleging the Dentsu-owned agency failed to prevent ad fraud. Fetch has now flipped the tables on the ride-hailing startup by suing Uber in federal court this week over $19 million in unpaid invoices, arguing that its contract didn\u2019t require it to police or prevent ad fraud from suppliers. The latest move is Fetch insisting on a federal court review after Uber sought to drop the claims last month and litigate the dispute in an ongoing state court case.\n\u2014Can We Split the Fare?\u2014\nThe countersuit fuels the debate around who is responsible for policing and preventing ad fraud\u2014the agency, the vendors the agency subcontracts, or the client? A lack of transparency in ad-buying practices and contracts has already created an environment of mistrust between marketing clients, and their agencies and vendors. Regardless of whether Fetch was contractually obligated to police fraud or whether Uber ignored Fetch\u2019s advice and warnings about certain suppliers, the dispute could further fan that sense of distrust.\nThese Are My Confessions The latest interview in Digiday\u2019s anonymous \u201cconfessions\u201d series has some attention-grabbing Quote: s from an audience development head at a midsize publisher, who opines on their relationship with Facebook . \u201cThey are going to completely deprioritize publishers,\u201d the anonymous executive says, claiming Facebook told them, \u201cIf I were you, I would probably not rely on Facebook as much as you are.\u201d That sounds ominous, but it\u2019s also common sense as we\u2019ve seen so many cautionary tales now of publishers being burned by algorithm changes or a switch in platform priorities (remember the commotion surrounding Facebook Live?). Perhaps the key line of the piece is the least controversial. The exec says 2018 is \u201cvery much going to be the year of the individual brand\u201d and it plans to elevate its journalists on Facebook as much as they push their own personal brands on Twitter. That could be an interesting trend to follow into this year, especially if advertisers start thinking about having a presence on those pages. I asked Facebook for its reaction to the Digiday piece, but the company declined to comment.\nLooking Back Over My Shoulder I Can See That Deal In Your Eye LUMA Partners, the digital media and marketing-focused investment bank, has released its latest quarterly report , which outlines the biggest ad tech, martech and digital content deals of 2017. Taking a look at ad tech specifically, LUMA describes 2017 as the year of the \u201cad tech clean-up,\u201d with all the remaining public companies that rely on insertion orders (rather than recurring platform fees) having been acquired. Private equity and companies in the telecom sector were among the most active buyers. For the year ahead, LUMA predicts ad tech firms that have a focus on first-party data should fare well because they are less vulnerable to \u201cexogenous forces\u201d such as Apple\u2019s Intelligent Tracker Prevention (the predicted impact of which has hurt Criteo\u2019s share price of late ) and Europe\u2019s new General Data Protection Rule. Martech was the star performer in 2017, with the sector\u2019s stocks growing 60%.\n\u2014Where\u2019s Your Head At\u2014\nOn a related note, Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser released his quarterly ad tech and martech headcount tracker, which is based on LinkedIn data. Mr. Wieser estimates companies in the sector expanded headcount by 8% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, a slowdown from the 10% growth estimated in the previous quarter. Over the past year, the group of companies Mr. Wieser tracked were firms with a focus on ad quality and brand safety. Their growth comes as little surprise since marketers have paid more attention this year to where their ads are actually ending up, thanks to high-profile incidents such as YouTube\u2019s brand safety snafu and the ongoing ad fraud cleanup.\nBest of the rest Adweek obtained early findings of a U.S. Army audit that reportedly suggests \u201cineffective marketing programs\u201d have wasted millions of dollars each year. [ Adweek ]\nSpotify reportedly confidentially filed IPO documents at the end of last month and could list its shares in the first quarter of this year. [ Axios ]\nBillionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel is reportedly interested in creating a new conservative cable news network.

Its home games sell out, its merchandise flies off the shelves, and two players, Marc-Andre Fleury and James Neal, are going to the All-Stars.\nBut all is not golden. The U.S. Army has just filed a formal complaint about the Vegas Golden Knights' name and team colors, saying they are too similar to those of the Army's parachute team.\n\"We strongly dispute the Army's allegations that confusion is likely between the Army Golden Knights parachute team and the Vegas Golden Knights major-league hockey team,\" the Vegas Golden Knights said in a statement to CNBC. \"Indeed, the two entities have been coexisting without any issues for over a year (along with several other Golden Knights trademark owners)\u2026.\"\nThe NHL told CNBC, \"We believe the underlying rationale of the Army's opposition isn't valid as a legal matter, and we intend to fully support Vegas' efforts to clarify their rights.\"\nFor its part, the Army said the complaint is part of a dispute resolution.\n\"The U.S. Army has been working with the team and the NHL for over a year to resolve any potential trademark issues,\" Alison Bettencourt, director of public affairs for the Army Marketing and Research Group, told CNBC. \"The legal action taken on Wednesday is part of the normal legal process and was necessary to protect the U.S. Army's rights as we continue to resolve any potential trademark disputes.\"\nStaff Sgt. Christopher S. Muncy | US Air National Guard United States Army Parachute Team conducts jump over Washington D.C. It's not the first time the Vegas team has encountered a backlash against its name. The College of St. Rose in Albany, New York, has been using the name Golden Knights since 2002. In 2004, it was granted a federal trademark.\nIn 2016, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected the hockey team's attempt to register for a trademark, on the basis that it would likely cause confusion with the previously registered Golden Knights mark.\nJulian Perlman, a litigation partner at Phillips Nizer LLP in New York, advises companies on issues of trademark and copyright protection. The Army, he said, doesn't \"want people thinking that this Vegas expansion team has the endorsement [of] or association with the Army's parachute team.\"\nBut Perlman predicted it would be a tough battle for the Army. \"If they were going to litigate this case and try to stop them from using the mark, they would have to show evidence of confusion.\"\nIndeed, in its statement to CNBC, the Vegas Golden Knights organization said, \"We are not aware of a single complaint from anyone attending our games that they were expecting to see the parachute team and not a professional hockey game.\"\nPerlman interpreted the Army's statement as an indication that it's actively negotiating with the NHL expansion team. \"Perhaps they're well on their way to a resolution, but it hasn't gotten completely hammered out. They still have to protect their rights.\" And part of protecting those rights is adhering to the process.\nPerlman said the vast majority of trademark disputes are settled without the intervention of the USPTO.\nStill, it might sting the owner of the Golden Knights, Bill Foley, who told CNBC in December how proud he was of his association with the military as a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point. He also served in the U.S. Air Force, and reportedly was actively working to get the Golden Knights parachute team to perform in Las Vegas, in connection with the launch of the hockey team.\nIt might be of some comfort to the Vegas Golden Knights as they work through the process of the application for a federal trademark to know the Army's Golden Knights don't have a trademark either."}

They're getting more connected and I think anything that helps with that is something that investors should take a look at.\"\nAlready this year, the space as a whole has outpaced broader markets' performance. The SMH semiconductor ETF is up 10 percent for the year to date, while the XLK Technology ETF (in which semiconductors have a 14 percent weighting) has risen 6.7 percent. The S&P 500 has climbed 5.6 percent during the same period.\nGains in 2018 would continue years of outperformance among semiconductor stocks. The SMH rose 36 percent in 2017, its second straight year exceeding the S&P 500. Meanwhile, the XLK advanced 32 percent, a ninth year in the green. Both outpaced the S&P 500's 20 percent gain in 2017.\nThe outperformance has made individual names in the space expensive, though. Take Nvidia for example \u2013 its shares have surged 20 percent since the beginning of the year, quadruple gains by the S&P, putting its price-earnings ratio at 50 times forward earnings.\n\"I'm not a fan of Nvidia to buy now,\" said Forrest. \"If you have it, you should hold it because it could grow into its PE.\"\nOthers in the space are comparably cheap. Micron Technology currently has a PE ratio of five times forward earnings.\nMicron has underperformed the rest of the group in recent months even after rocketing 88 percent higher over 2017. Since hitting its highest levels since 2000 in November, its shares have pulled back roughly 14 percent.\nShould it add to those losses, it would raise concerns over the health of the broader semis space, according to Matt Maley , equity strategist at Miller Tabak.\n\"On a technical basis, it's forming what you call a symmetrical triangle,\" Maley told \"Trading Nation.\" If it breaks lower, \"it would be a yellow warning flag, not a red flag, but a warning flag for the group.\"\n\nMicron has fallen more days than it has risen in 2018 so far. Even so, its shares have added nearly 4 percent since the beginning of the year. Its peers AMD , Nvidia, and Texas Instruments have all seen double-digit percentage increases this year, while NXP Semiconductors and Broadcom have had gains in the low single-digits.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

But the political foundation of Donald Trump 's presidency was racial grievance. \nTrump has repeatedly appealed to unhappy whites with his denunciation of Mexican immigrants, his defense of white supremacist protesters, and his attacks on black athletes protesting for racial justice. Thursday's Oval Office excoriation of \"s---hole countries\" in Africa and the Caribbean simply followed that pattern . (Trump appeared to deny making the comment on Friday, although some senators in the room at the time pushed back against him ). \nAs a candidate and as president, Trump has sounded plenty of race-neutral themes, including the call for tax cuts that culminated in landmark legislation last month. But some political science research has shown that his blunt race-tinged messages were the reason he vaulted past an experienced lineup of rivals to win the 2016 Republican nomination and then the White House. \nEmily Ekins, director of polling at the libertarian Cato Institute, identified five groups of Trump voters as part of a broader Democracy Fund study of the 2016 election. Key to his emergence, she concluded, was the 20 percent segment she called \"preservationists,\" who stood out for their \"nativist and ethno-cultural conception of American identity.\" \n\"American Preservationists comprise the core Trump constituency that propelled him to victory in the early Republican primaries,\" Ekins wrote. \nShe characterized them as having low levels of education, income and political information, watching lots of television, and offering strong professions of Christian faith combined with infrequent church attendance. With many of them disabled and on Medicaid, they display hostility toward Wall Street, support for redistribution of wealth, and concern about their government retirement benefits. \nTheir economic views help explain Trump's pledge not to touch Social Security and Medicare benefits. Their social views explain where they found kinship with him. \n\"They are far more likely to have a strong sense of their own racial identity,\" Ekins wrote. \"They take the most restrictionist approach to immigration \u2013 staunchly opposing not just illegal but legal immigration as well, and intensely supporting a temporary Muslim travel ban. \n\"They feel the greatest amount of angst over race relations. They believe that anti-white discrimination is as pervasive as other forms of discrimination.\" \nIn some ways, the emergence of a Republican nominee with Trump's instincts and support base represents the logical conclusion to decades of political evolution in a steadily diversifying nation. \nAs late as 1960, Republican candidate Richard Nixon drew a third of the black vote. But after Democratic president Lyndon Johnson won enactment of civil rights legislation over the opposition of Republican rival Barry Goldwater in 1964, voting patterns changed. \nNo Republican has reached 20 percent of the black vote since; no Democrat has carried a majority of whites. The \"Solid South,\" once controlled by Democratic segregationists rooted in the old Confederacy, switched parties to become a Republican redoubt. \nAn evolution toward social tolerance among younger Americans, on issues including sexuality as well as race, points toward diminished relevance of identity divisions over the long run. But anxiousness among whites \u2013 who have shrunk to 70 percent of the electorate from over 90 percent in the 1960s \u2013 will offer a tempting target for Trump-like Republicans as America becomes a majority-minority nation over the next three decades. \n\"By making questions of national identity more salient, Donald Trump succeeded in winning over 'populists' who had previously voted for Democrats,\" analyst Lee Drutman wrote in another part of the Democracy Fund study. \nTrump's success, which accelerated pre-existing trends, has given Republicans more blue-collar support and Democrats more allies among better-educated, more affluent suburbanites. That blurs some historic partisan splits over economics, while sharpening those the president continues to inflame. \n\"The primary conflict structuring the two parties,\" Drutman observed, \"involves questions of national identity, race and morality.\""}

At its peak LeEco owed creditors 10 billion yuan. \nChina Merchants Bank applied in July to have some of LeEco\u2019s assets frozen, saying a LeEco unit, Leview Mobile HK Limited, had been late making interest payments on a loan. \nIn a letter published last week, Jia referred to the loan as one of the key causes of the cash-flow problems. \n\u201cOur next step is to actively seek communication with China Merchants Bank with the hope that we can get some of our frozen assets proportionately released so that we can repay more of our debts. We hereby request China Merchants Bank to understand and support us\u201d, Gan said in the post. \nChina Merchants did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nCoolpad on Friday said its top shareholder Leview Mobile HK Ltd had reduced its stake to 10.95 percent from 28.78 percent by selling shares to Power Sun Ventures Limited. \nGan also said 929 million yuan worth of assets had been transferred from LeEco\u2019s e-commerce subsidiary LeMall to another of its core listed unit\u2019s Tianjin-based subsidiaries, New Leshi Smart Home, to pay off some debts. The firm said last week that it was trying to get 3 billion yuan worth of funding. \nFounder Jia was placed on an official blacklist of debt defaulters in early December, a move taken by Chinese courts to put pressure on people and entities to repay debts, and was ordered by regulators to return to the country before the end of 2017 to address the mounting debt pile linked to his firms. \nBut Jia defied the order to return, saying he needed to stay in the United States as a fundraising for his electric car business was making progress. He empowered his wife and brother, Jia Yuemin, to act on his behalf.

A winter storm is traveling up the east coast of the United States dumping snow and creating blizzard like conditions in many areas. Two airplanes collided on the tarmac at John F. Kennedy Airport early Saturday morning amid rampant delays caused by a powerful Northeast winter storm .\nOfficials told NBC News New York that a China Southern aircraft's right wing grazed the tail of a Kuwait Airways vessel, damaging both planes. Port Authority officials said no injuries were reported and that all passengers were able to safely disembark, NBC reported.\nAccording to the Federal Aviation Administration, the China Southern plane was being towed during the collision, which occurred just after midnight. It carried no passengers, officials told the news outlet.\nThe Kuwait Airways flight was parked ahead of takeoff when the planes collided, the airline said on Twitter.Kuwait's passengers were transported to nearby hotels to await new flight arrangements as New York authorities investigated the incident, the airline added.\nThe collision came on top of lengthy and extensive delays throughout JFK Airport, brought on by a powerful blizzard that wreaked havoc on the East Coast in the first week of the new year.\nThe Port Authority attributed the delays to a backlog of flights, hundreds of which were cancelled ahead of the storm. JFK logged over 350 cancellations on Friday and another 53 as of 11 a.m. ET on Saturday, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.\nSince Friday, outraged passengers have been taking to Twitter to air out frustrations with the delays.

JFK ranked No. 1 among destination airports for the most cancellations and delays.\nAs of early Saturday, nearly 300 flights within, into or out of the United States were cancelled and over 1,204 were delayed.\nThe Port Authority \u2014 which manages JFK, New Jersey's Newark International and New York City's LaGuardia \u2014 also warned of traffic congestion in and around those two travel hubs.

How you can become one","text":"34,000 Source: Fidelity Investments \nWhile the increase is due, in part, to the recent market run-up , savers are also setting more money aside for retirement, said Jeanne Thompson, a senior vice president of Fidelity Investments. \nNearly 3 in 10 savers increased their contribution rate over the last year, Fidelity said. The average 401(k) contribution rate is now 8.5 percent as of the third quarter, the highest percentage in almost 10 years. \nThree tips to grow your 401(k) \n1. Start saving as early as possible. \" The story of the 401(k) millionaire highlights the beauty of compounding,\" Thompson said. \"To save a million within a 401(k), it does take the better part of a career.\" 2. Take full advantage of a company match, when available. Roughly 1 in 5 workers still isn't contributing enough to get a full employer match, according to Fidelity. That's partly because many companies auto-enroll at a level that is lower than the match ceiling. To work your way up, Thompson suggests incremental changes. \"Increase your savings 1 percent every year to a target of 15 percent.\" 3. Don't invest too conservatively for your age. For young investors, shying away from stocks in favor of bonds could short-change your long-term grown potential (less risk means less return) , Thompson said. \nJust because your account is climbing, that's no reason to get complacent, said Kate Stalter, the co-owner and senior financial advisor at Better Money Decisions in Albuquerque, New Mexico. \n\"Whatever you have in your 401(k), make sure you are properly allocated with global stocks and bonds and different asset classes,\" she advised. \n\"While getting to a million is great, you still need to think about your financial plan,\" Stalter said, \"including your life expectancy, spending level, family make up and debt level, among other factors.\" \nAs a rule of thumb, Thompson recommends saving 10 times your income by retirement age, in which case, \"a million is a good savings target for someone earning $100,000,\" she said. \nMore from Your Money, Your Future: "}

Domestic stock fund manager of the year \nSteven Wymer \u2014 Fidelity Growth Company \nThe Fidelity Growth Company grew 36.8 percent last year, with its stakes in tech and biotech helping boost results. \n\"We put together this portfolio over a lot of years. We found some good stocks, and we stuck through them through some tough times and figured out which ones were going to carry the water for us over the years,\" the fund's portfolio manager, Steven Wymer, said in an interview with \" Power Lunch \" on Wednesday. \nFor example, Wymer bought Nvidia back in 2008. The stock rallied 82 percent in 2017. \nIn addition to Nvidia, the fund's top holdings include Apple , Amazon , Alphabet and Facebook . \nWhile the market has had a good runup, Wymer still sees opportunities for growth names this year. \n\"The opportunities should broaden out quite a bit. Not only is the U.S. economy accelerating, but the international economy is a tailwind to the market. Along with the weaker dollar, we're seeing some favorable business results translate back into U.S. earnings,\" he said. International stock fund manager of the year \nSarah Ketterer, Harry Hartford and team \u2014 Causeway International Value Morningstar called Causeway International Value 's stock selection \"quite solid,\" particularly in the eurozone and in South Korea. The fund saw a 27.1 percent return in 2017. \nTo find value, the fund's managers look for companies that are in operational distress but not financial distress. For example, the fund built a big stake in Volkswagen during the emissions scandal. The automaker was up more than 40 percent last year. \nThe fund also has a relatively low turnover portfolio of 50 to 60 names. \n\"Concentration means more bang for the buck. So when we have a big weight in Samsung Electronics it really makes a difference,\" said Sarah Ketterer, Causeway's CEO and co-founder. \n\"If you have small weights that means you've got this proliferation of stocks and you've diluted your great ideas,\" she told \"Power Lunch.\" show chapters"}

Age only made the problem worse. A few years ago, a medical professional recommended Judy use a footstool to raise her knees while on the toilet.\nShe tried it, and it worked. \"It's just a world of difference,\" she said. Her husband, Bill, was amazed. \"We both thought, 'Wow, we're in our 60s, why are we just now hearing about this?'\"\nBut the footstool wasn't perfect, and so Bobby \u2014 a self-described gypsy forever looking to make a \"big splash\" \u2014 saw a business opportunity. \"There was nothing out there on the market that we could find to help us solve the problem. So we made it.\"\nJeniece Pettitt | CNBC Squatty Potty has a variety of options for sale including this wooden stool They made the first stool out of wood and named it the Squatty Potty, based on what they heard traditional hole-in-the-ground toilets in China were called. Other potential names included \"The Health Step,\" \"The S--- Shelf\" and \"The Stool Stool.\"\nBobby said squatting is the way humans are supposed to, well, poop. \"We all have a kink in our colon,\" he said. \"It's there to maintain continence. Otherwise we'd be crapping our pants wherever we go.\" Sitting on a toilet relaxes the kink to a point, but squatting opens everything up for better evacuation. \"Most of your problems with your colon start where that kink is,\" said his father, Bill.\nJeniece Pettitt | CNBC The Squatty Potty tucks right in to most toilets. The family began giving footstools to friends, who considered them gag gifts, until they started using them. \"I saw the results, and I saw the effect on people, and I'm like, 'There really is something here,'\" said Bobby. So he and his parents and one other brother took $35,000 to set up a website and begin manufacturing for real.\nJudy decided the stools needed to be made out of plastic to bring down the price, and they placed their first large order. \"The first order was like 2,000 Squatty Potties. They arrived from China, and we got this big container full,\" said Bobby. \"I was like, 'What? We are never going to sell these,' right? Now we sell that many a day.\"\nJeniece Pettitt | CNBC The founders of Squatty Potty. Bobby, Judy and Bill Edwards. In the beginning, Bobby sent free Squatty Potties to health bloggers to generate buzz, and success has flowed with more regularity than Metamucil. Dr. Oz's show called (Bill Edwards thought it was a crank call from his kids), and then Howard Stern started talking about the product.\nFinally, on their second try, Squatty Potty qualified for \"Shark Tank.\" They sold $1 million in product within 24 hours of the TV appearance, and the company also received a $350,000 investment from Lori Greiner, which led to high-profile shelf space in Bed Bath & Beyond .\nFirst-year sales in 2011 were $17,000. Sales hit a whopping $19 million in 2015. And by the end of 2017, they reached nearly $33 million. \"We're going to probably hit $100 million within the next few years,\" said Judy.\nIn the past year, the company has developed new products like a toilet plunger incorporating the poo emoji and a line of toilet deodorant sprays. The Edwards have expanded operations in Utah and added a new plant in Canada to focus on international sales.\nThe biggest challenge has always been finding a marketing balance between humor and health. \"You can get really gross, or you can get so ambiguous that people don't know what you're talking about,\" said Bobby.\nThe Squatty Potty YouTube ad is a good example. It stars a Prince Charming character and a unicorn that poops ice cream. \"This is where your ice cream comes from,\" says the prince. \"(Unicorns) are good at pooping, but you know who sucks at pooping? You do.\"\nWhen first presented with the idea for the video, the Edwards family thought it was too cheeky and too expensive. \"We're talking about a subject nobody wants to talk about,\" said Judy, \"and if a unicorn, or anything, is going to show poop, we don't want it to be poop, we want it to be something that people like and enjoy.\"\nHence, the ice cream. \"It's not OK to talk about poop, but it's OK to talk about ice cream,\" said Bill.\nThey eventually decided to spend $250,000 to make the ad. At last count, it had over 100 million views, and sales have surged. \"We're going to make more videos, and they're going to cost a lot more than that,\" Bill laughed.\nJeniece Pettitt | CNBC Bobby Edwards demonstrates how the Squatty Potty works. Squatty Potty has run into a couple of hiccups. In May 2017, the company dropped Kathy Griffin as a spokeswoman after her infamous photo with a fake severed head of Donald Trump.\nAlso, after releasing their new SquattyPottymus for kids last fall, they recalled the top portion \u2014 the \"hat\" \u2014 after receiving reports of two children slipping and hurting themselves. The rest of the unit continued to sell well through the holidays.\nUltimately, the success has been stunning. Judy Edwards originally thought they might just sell a few Squatty Potties here or there to help supplement their retirement income, because no one likes to discuss pooping problems.\n\"I still am embarrassed to talk about it,\" she said. Not nearly as embarrassed as she used to be.\nLearn more about the founders of Squatty Potty in CNBC's new podcast: Strange Success , which you can listen to on Apple Podcasts.\nDisclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to \"Shark Tank.\" This is an update of a previously published article."}

{"published":"2018-01-03T18:03:00.000+02:00","title":"5 things small business owners should know or do in 2018","text":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Small business owners have entered 2018 with many questions about how big their tax bills will be, but they're also optimistic about profiting from a strong economy. And aside from financial matters, owners with employees must stay mindful about one of the troubling issues of 2017, sexual harassment.\nHere are five things small business owners need to know about or do in 2018:\nTAXES\nThe new tax law changes rates for many small business owners, whether they are sole proprietorships, partnerships or corporations. But the benefits aren't across the board: Some owners will lose out on savings because they'll end 2018 with income above thresholds set out in the law, or they work in fields like accounting, law or consulting.\nMany business owners aren't sure yet how the law will affect them. Although accountants and other tax professionals may have given owners some general ideas about the impact, the IRS must still write regulations that will spell out what taxpayers can do under the law and how they must comply.\nSome things are known. The Section 179 deduction that small businesses can use to get an immediate break on purchases of equipment ranging from computers to vehicles to manufacturing equipment doubles this year to $1 million.\nAnd separate from the tax bill, the IRS has set the standard mileage rate for business use for a car at 54.5 cents per mile, up 1 cent from 2017. The rate is one of two methods for accounting for how much an owner spent on using a car for business; the second is to deduct the actual expenses for the car. Under the actual expense method an owner must calculate the percentage of miles the car is driven for business, and apply that percentage to expenses like lease payments, fuel, maintenance, repairs, insurance and depreciation.\nTHE ECONOMY\nIf the economy maintains the robust expansion it showed in 2017, owners' profits and their optimism should grow as well. But that may not translate into more jobs.\nIn multiple surveys last year, owners indicated they're generally sticking to their conservative hiring patterns. Job creation plans ticked higher in a fourth-quarter survey by researchers at Pepperdine University's Graziadio School of Business and Management and Dun & Bradstreet Corp., with 42 percent of small business owners saying they'd add one to two staffers in the next six months, up from 38 percent in the third quarter.\nOwners have said a significant revenue increase might persuade them to hire. For many, that could depend on whether consumer spending remains strong. The government's figures on retail sales and consumer spending show Americans were feeling fine about spending as 2017 ended, a sign that business will be good in the new year. Retail sales rose 0.8 percent in November after a 0.5 percent gain in October, according to the Commerce Department. Overall consumer spending rose 0.6 percent in November after rising 0.2 percent in October.\nMany small businesses are dependent on consumers, among them restaurants, retailers and service providers like hair salons. Consumers may feel like spending if the stock market extends its big 2017 advance; the Dow Jones industrial average rose 25 percent, giving many people with 401(k)s and other accounts a stronger sense of financial well-being.\nUnpredictable events like blizzards and hurricanes can hurt spending, and slow the economy. But if consumers regain their confidence quickly, small businesses are likely to shrug off any dips.\nHEALTH CARE\nMost companies' health care plans are set for 2018, but there will be some changes when it comes time to choose policies that begin later this year or in 2019.\nOwners who want to sign up for group insurance through the government's Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP, now must do so through a health insurance agent or broker or directly through an insurance company. They're no longer able to sign up through the government website, www.healthcare.gov . However, they can visit the site to get information.\nThe new tax law has ended the requirement that individuals buy health insurance starting in 2019. Some very small business owners had stopped offering health plans when the Affordable Care Act was enacted because their staffers were able to get coverage through health insurance exchanges. While businesses with fewer than 50 employees aren't required to offer insurance, some may find their staffers are interested in group coverage.\nSEXUAL HARASSMENT\nHuman resources experts usually advise business owners to update their employee handbooks early in the year. It's a task that's more of a priority at many companies this year following a series of reports of workplace sexual harassment.\n\"Every employer should have a policy in their handbook that makes clear that sexual harassment is not welcome and that defines sexual harassment,\" says Jay Starkman, CEO of Engage PEO, an HR provider based in Hollywood, Florida.\nOwners can find templates for sexual harassment policies online. Whether they're creating a policy for the first time or already have one, they should have it reviewed by an HR professional or an attorney with expertise in sexual harassment or employment law.\nCompanies may also want to consider training sessions to educate staffers and managers about harassment \u2014 what it is, how to recognize it, how to report it to owners or senior executives.\nOwners who don't have employee handbooks should think about creating them. Besides harassment policies, they should contain the company's policies on discrimination, discipline, vacations, performance reviews, ethics and use of company computers, among many other issues. They should also include information on benefits. Owners can find templates online.\nMINIMUM WAGE RISES\nEighteen states have higher minimum wages as of Dec. 31, 2017, or Jan. 1.\nLaws were passed boosting the wage floor in 10 of those states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state.\nEight states see increases because their minimums are tied to the inflation rate. They are Alaska, Florida, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio and South Dakota.\nSmall businesses such as restaurants or food service companies are most likely to now be paying their workers more under the higher minimums. Three-fifths of all workers paid at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour are in the leisure and hospitality industries. Almost all of those are restaurants or food service businesses, according to the Department of Labor.\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com\/JoyceMRosenberg .

{"published":"2018-01-05T01:01:00.000+02:00","title":"California has ample weapons to fight Trump on drilling","text":"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 In the decades since a 1969 oil spill near Santa Barbara tarred sea-life and gave rise to the U.S. environmental movement, politicians and environmental activists have built up ample ways to make it difficult but not impossible for the Trump administration to renew drilling off California's coast.\nThe Interior Department said Thursday it plans to open most federal waters off the United States to oil leases.\nIn California, where no new federal leases offshore have been approved since 1984, Gov. Jerry Brown joined governors of Oregon and Washington in vowing to do \"whatever it takes\" to stop that from happening off the West Coast.\nState officials, environmental groups and oil-industry analysts say California has solid regulatory and legal means to try to make good on that threat.\nFor one thing, oil companies know that even if the federal government sells leases in federal waters, California and other coastal states by law control the three miles (five kilometers) nearest to shore, all along the coasts.\nThat means California decides on permits for any oil pipelines that would connect oil platforms to land, along with any transport centers, refineries or holding stations once the crude makes it ashore.\n\"Operators don't tend to operate (off) states that don't want production,\" said Kevin Book, an analyst with ClearView Energy Partners in Washington, D.C.\nThere are ways around California's three-mile (five-kilometer) lock on shore \u2014 such as using ships to transport oil from platforms in federal waters instead of pipelines, he said.\nBut considering all the potential financial, regulatory and legal problems oil companies would face in drilling off California, oil prices would have to go far higher to make that enticing, Book said.\n\"At today's crude oil prices, the way companies look at political risk ... when you do the math on paper it doesn't add up,\" Book said.\nBrown joined both U.S. senators and other state officials last year in appealing unsuccessfully to Obama to ban California offshore drilling before he left office, and polls show most Californians opposed to offshore drilling.\nCalifornians vividly remember the 1969 oil spill and a 2015 Southern California spill from a pipeline serving a platform in federal waters that blackened more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) of public beaches and closed two state parks.\n\"You walk on the beach and see oil in the sand and the water and washing up, and there's dead birds and dead fish,\" said Kristen Hislop, with the Environmental Defense Center, a Santa Barbara environmental group formed in response to the 1969 oil spill. \"You very much remember why we fight so hard to protect our coastline.\"\nIn California, \"we do have plenty of opportunity to fight these new oil developments and we will pursue all those avenues,\" said Linda Krop, legal counsel for the same group.\nFor example, a 1972 federal coastal act gives California extensive input on federal actions along the coast, including the granting of federal oil leases.\n\"Nothing galvanizes bipartisan resistance in California like the threat of more offshore drilling,\" said Dayna Bochco, chairwoman of the California Coastal Commission, which would have the authority to oppose offshore leases under that act. \"We've fought similar efforts before, and we will fight them again.\"\nRobert Jablon in Los Angeles contributed to this report."}

The state election officials have upped their game. And I think we are \u2013 not as fast as I\u2019d like \u2013 but I think electoral systems are going to be on better guard\u201d for congressional elections in November this year, Warner said. Sen.

Bernstein \nWarner and fellow Democrats have worked closely with the Senate panel\u2019s Republican chairman, Senator Richard Burr. The bipartisanship contrasts with a parallel investigation by the House Intelligence Committee, where inter-party feuds have imperiled the effort, and may lead committee Republicans and Democrats to issue competing reports. \nIn the interview, Warner repeated a warning that he made in a Dec. 20 Senate floor speech that any move by Trump aimed at firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller would provoke a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d \nMueller is conducting a criminal probe of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, something the White House denies. Two Trump campaign associates, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and aide George Papadopoulos, have pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in Mueller\u2019s probe. \nWarner said his concern that Trump might take a step to dismiss Mueller was confirmed by news reports on Thursday detailing steps the president reportedly took to blunt the Russia investigation. \nTrump, the reports said, ordered White House counsel Donald McGahn to convince Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself from the Justice Department\u2019s Russia probe, so Sessions could remain in charge of it. Sessions recused himself anyway. \n\u201cIf true, it\u2019s one more example of this president\u2019s unusual behavior,\u201d the senator said. \n\u201cAnd it\u2019s one of the reasons why I don\u2019t take as absolute the White House\u2019s assurances, \u2018oh no, we have no plans\u2019\u201d to fire Mueller. \u201cBecause clearly this is based upon the president\u2019s actions on a variety of topics \u2013 things can change on a dime.\u201d Reporting by Mark Hosenball and Warren Strobel; additional reporting by Jonathan Landay; Editing by John Walcott and Grant McCool"}

A subsidiary of Canada's Brookfield Asset Management plans to acquire Westinghouse Electric, the bankrupt nuclear services company owned by Toshiba , for $4.6 billion.\nBrookfield Business Partners said in a statement on Thursday that it and institutional partners would use $1 billion of equity and $3 billion of long-term debt financing to buy the Pittsburgh-based business, its first investment in nuclear power.\nThe buyers are also assuming Westinghouse's underfunded pension plan.\nNew York-listed shares of Brookfield Business Partners were up 3.4 percent in afternoon trading.\nThe deal is expected to close in the third quarter but will require approval from regulators and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.\nWestinghouse has said it is aiming to exit bankruptcy as soon as March, which would allow Toshiba to book tax benefits in the current fiscal year.\n\"Brookfields acquisition of Westinghouse reaffirms our position as the leader of the global nuclear industry, said Westinghouse Chief Executive Officer Jos\u00e9 Emeterio Guti\u00e9rrez.\nToshiba did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe Brookfield group of companies is among the world's largest investors in stable, long-lived assets such as utilities, real estate, energy and infrastructure.\n\"Acquiring Westinghouse definitely fits the risk approach they have,\" said Mycle Schneider, an energy and nuclear policy consultant in Paris. \"They buy assets in shaky situations.\"\nLast year, Brookfield Asset Management acquired control of two owners of renewable energy projects, TerraForm Global and TerraForm Power, from SunEdison, which had filed for Chapter 11.\nIn 2016, Brookfield Business Partners converted debt to a large equity stake in a Texas power producer that emerged from Chapter 11 and became Vistra Energy. And in November, Brookfield Property Partners offered to buy the remaining shares in General Growth Properties, adding to a large stake it purchased to bring the mall owner out of bankruptcy.\nSchneider said he was surprised that Brookfield acquired Westinghouse, given that the company has no other nuclear businesses. Westinghouse is one the world's leading suppliers of nuclear fuel, and it provides some form of service to 80 percent of the world's 450 commercial reactors, according to court records.\nThose two business lines generated combined cash flow of $403 million on revenue of about $3.1 billion in Westinghouse's 2015 financial year, according to court records.\nHowever, the company suffered after it agreed to build two plants in the U.S. Southeast on fixed-price contracts. The project went billions of dollars over budget, and Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy in March to escape the contracts.\nConstruction of new nuclear power plants globally has dropped to the lowest level in a decade following renewed safety concerns after the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011.\nOne of Westinghouse's unfinished U.S. projects, known as Vogtle in Georgia, will continue with Southern Co. replacing the company as the project manager. A South Carolina project known as V.C. Summer was abandoned in July.\nThe lead utility behind the V.C. Summer project, Scana Corp , agreed on Wednesday to a $7.9 billion takeover bid from Dominion Energy Inc.\nWestinghouse has joined a consortium bidding to provide nuclear power in Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest new markets in the world. Bringing Westinghouse out of bankruptcy could help close a proposed deal for six of the company's new AP1000 reactors in India."}

The TB12 Method had a controversial philosophy on injury-recovery mindset and was loaded with so many rules that one unnamed Patriots staffer said in the ESPN report it \"felt like a cult.\"\nRead more from USA Today:\n2018 NFL mock draft 1.0: Sam Darnold, Josh Rosen vie for No. 1\nUSA TODAY Sports' wild-card playoff picks\nSocial media erupts over hip-hop skating routine\nGuerrero, invited on the Patriots' staff as a consultant, would blame Patriots trainers for injuries. Belichick confronted Brady in early September about pressure that players were feeling by Guerrero to train at TB12 instead of with the team. There was no resolution to the meeting, ESPN reported. Belichick, in an effort to clarify Guerrero's role, later emailed Guerrero to let him know he wasn't permitted access to the team headquarters because he wasn't an employee.\nAmong the key disagreements among the three franchise leaders was who would be around last, as well as management of past controversies. Brady, according to the ESPN report, wanted backup QB Jimmy Garoppolo gone. The Patriots eventually dealt Garoppolo to the San Francisco 49ers.\nThe trade left Belichick feeling \"furious and demoralized,\" while Brady's body language showed a \"liberated\" resolve. That outcome, a Patriots staffer told ESPN, showed Brady \"won.\"\nThe story adds that in the midst of the internal dysfunction, Belichick has \"become good friends\" with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, meeting with him for a long and private meeting earlier this season.\nAnother claim: Kraft, according to the report, privately told associates that he went too far in his attacks against the NFL during the Deflategate scandal and penalty, but he was forced to support Brady \"for the fans.\"\nMessages left by USA TODAY Sports to the Patriots on Friday morning were not immediately returned. The team denied dysfunction in the ESPN story and cited \"several inaccuracies.\""}

Bet on it,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG. \nThough unemployment is low and growth may hit 2.5 percent in 2018, Bostic said weak wage growth and inflation are two reasons to be guarded. \nIn addition, he said he is concerned the public may be losing confidence in the Fed\u2019s commitment or ability to reach its inflation target, \u201canchoring\u201d expectations below that level. Public and market expectations are considered an important component in inflation outcomes, and Bostic said recent survey evidence \u201cindicates that individuals may not be completely convinced...This possibility is one factor that might argue for being somewhat more patient.\u201d \nBostic added that the estimated \u201cneutral\u201d rate of interest that would keep inflation at target and economic growth at trend may have slipped to \u201cclose to\u201d 2 percent. If true, it means the Fed could only raise rates two or three more times, from the current range of between 1.25 percent to 1.50 percent, before monetary policy is no longer \u201cloose\u201d and encouraging economic activity. \nEven as it raises rates the Fed wants to remain \u201caccommodative,\u201d with a federal funds target below neutral.

The event registered as a magnitude 2.0 earthquake on the Richter scale SHARES Source: IG\/@topherlaine \nA bright and loud fireball in the sky over Detroit on Tuesday night was a falling meteor. \nAt about 8:10 p.m. ET witnesses in Michigan and several surrounding states reported hearing a loud boom and a brief blazing flash in the sky, said the American Meteor Society. \nFootage from dash cams showed the blast. Tweet \nThe explosion registered as a magnitude 2.0 earthquake on the Richter Scale, U.S. Geological Survey said. Witnesses reported weak or light shaking in areas around where the explosion occurred, according to USGS data . \nThe meteor was about two yards in diameter and fell into the atmosphere at about 28,000 miles per hour, said Bill Cooke, who leads NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. \nThe flash it made is called a \"super bolide,\" a term given to fireballs that are brighter than the moon but dimmer than the sun, Cooke said. \n\"Fireballs of that magnitude are pretty rare for Michigan,\" he said, adding that only about 10 super bolides explode above the United States in a year. The fact that this happened above the populous Detroit area is one reason the story is generating so much interest, he said. \nAs it burned up, the meteor probably sloughed off a spray of smaller meteorites, which are likely lying on the ground near the site. \nIn the wake of these events, meteor hunters collect meteorite samples and send them to NASA or other institutions that have the equipment to study the rocks. \nResearchers typically run the rocks through machines that can determine what elements they contain and categorize them. \nAbout 90 percent of meteors are \"stony meteorites\" made of common rock substances such as silicates, Cooke said, but a few have higher amounts of elements such as nickel and iron. \nThey can also determine the \"cosmic ray exposure ages\" of the rocks. There are tests that tell how long the rock was in space based on its level of exposure to cosmic rays. "}

FILE PHOTO: Office blocks of Citi, Barclays, and HSBC banks are seen at dusk in the Canary Wharf financial district in London, Britain November 16, 2017. REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo \nData compiled by Reuters from 13 banks\u2019 filings, some of which were released only late last month, shows they paid an average of $1.06 million to such staff in 2016, down from $2 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2013 when new European Union rules aimed at curbing banker bonuses took effect. \nThe Wall Street banks\u2019 higher pay packages show how they have bounced back more quickly from the financial crisis than their peers in Britain, some of which have faced hefty post-crisis costs that have limited banker pay. \nThe data also shows that EU rules to rein in banker bonuses, blamed for driving excessive risk-taking in the run up to the 2008 crisis, are having an impact. \nJPMorgan paid 672 staff in senior or risk-taking positions a total of $1.02 billion in 2016 for an average of $1.52 million each, while 724 Goldman bankers took home an average of $1.48 million each, according to Reuters\u2019 calculations from the filings. \nU.S. banks were also able to capitalise more effectively than European rivals on spikes in volatility in financial markets in 2016 from Britain\u2019s June Brexit vote. \nEurope\u2019s top investment banks\u2019 trading in fixed income products fell by 6 percent in the second quarter of 2016, while their five biggest U.S. rivals reported a 21 percent increase to $13.1 billion in revenue from the same business. \nThe disclosures are among the most comprehensive released on bankers\u2019 pay in Britain, which remains a controversial subject ten years on from the financial crisis. \nA report by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development released on Thursday showed that a median worker salary in Britain is about $38,493. In contrast, the average pay of a senior banker in 2016 was $1.06 million. FILE PHOTO: The late winter light shines on the buildings in the City of London financial district of London, Britain November 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Simon Dawson\/File Photo \nThe report highlighted that the average boss of one of Britain\u2019s top companies will by Thursday have already earned the same as the typical worker will make in the entire year. \nThe banks\u2019 pay disclosures make no mention of gender pay gaps, but banks in Britain may have to begin reporting such data after the government last April announced employers would have to disclose the difference between what they pay men and women by April 2018. \nThe average pay levels for bankers in the filings were boosted by a handful of top earners, with 10 Goldman bankers earning the highest band of more than 9 million euros in 2016 while 14 JPMorgan executives took home that lender\u2019s top bracket of over 5 million euros each. \nThe pay disclosures focus on banks\u2019 senior executives and \u2018material risk takers\u2019, and show how an EU rule that came into force in 2014 capping variable or bonus pay at 200 percent of fixed pay has cut fat bonuses. \nWhile Goldman Sachs paid senior staff more than five times more in variable pay than fixed in 2013, before the rule took effect, that ratio fell in 2016 to 0.6 times. \nGoldman in 2016 paid the top bankers $679 million in cash, and gave them 1.63 million shares in the bank which were worth a total of $389.6 million based on the bank\u2019s year-end share price of $239. \nAnalysis of the filings also shows how regulators have sought to broaden the number of bankers deemed material risk takers, with the total whose pay is captured by the data rising from 2,604 in 2013 to 8,360 in 2016. \nThe disclosures cover British banks globally and overseas banks\u2019 British-based staff, and contain more detail than is found in pay disclosures in other non-EU regions. \nMost banks released the details earlier last year, but some banks such as Goldman reported last month just before the year-end deadline. \nGoldman declined to comment."}

You\u2019ve got to take the player\u2019s words sometimes, and hopefully he gets through fine, if he gets the opportunity.\u201d \nThe Australia skipper, who has accumulated a series-leading 604 runs at an average of 151, did not name a side but left no one in any doubt that he would be leading it despite missing training on Tuesday because of a bad back. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit stiff but nothing I haven\u2019t dealt with before,\u201d Smith said. \n\u201dI\u2019ll have a good hit and a good catch today and I\u2019ll be fine tomorrow. \n\u201cI love batting out here at the SCG, it\u2019s my home ground and I\u2019ve made a few good scores. So hopefully I can continue the run.\u201d \nStarc looks likely to return in place of Jackson Bird, who laboured as a stand-in on an Melbourne Cricket Ground pitch rated as \u201cpoor\u201d by the governing International Cricket Council. \nLeft-arm tweaker Ashton Agar was also brought into the squad to offer Australia the option of going with two spinners if it looked like the SCG was going to offer a lot of turn. \nSmith, though, said that it was unlikely that one of the quicks would make way for a second slow bowler in addition to off-spinner Nathan Lyon as the hosts look to wrap up the series 4-0. \n\u201cThe wicket\u2019s got a fair bit of grass and looks to be a pretty good wicket,\u201d he added. \n\u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019d probably opt for just the one spinner.

Rouhani has been pursuing a conservative budget policy to bring Iran\u2019s volatile state finances under control, part of his effort to create an attractive environment for foreign investors. Meanwhile, fighting corruption would risk a backlash from powerful interests hurt by a crackdown. \nMehrdad Emadi, an Iranian economist who is head of energy risk analysis at the Betamatrix consultancy in London, said Rouhani faced a \u201cHerculean challenge\u201d fighting corruption in particular. But he suggested Rouhani might have no choice. \n\u201cPeople are more and more desperate,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this situation, there will be periodic outbreaks of dissent.\u201d SANCTIONS \nAfter taking power in 2013, Rouhani quickly reversed the spendthrift fiscal and monetary policies of his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, curbing a system of cash handouts for lower- and middle-income Iranians. \nLast month he proposed another conservative budget to parliament for the Iranian year starting next March 21. The $104 billion budget was up about 6 percent from the plan for the current year - a cut in real terms at current inflation rates. \nSuch austerity has become increasingly unpopular among the public as the economy has struggled despite the end of sanctions. Many foreign banks and companies remain reluctant to do business with Iran, partly because U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s hard line on Tehran has deterred trade and investment. \nEmadi said a study to which he contributed found Iranians were dissatisfied with the economy for five main reasons: unemployment, weak purchasing power, corruption, a weak rial, and unequal distribution of wealth among Iran\u2019s regions. \nThe study showed their perceptions of the first three areas have worsened this year, he said. In some areas of southeast Iran, unemployment among young people has reached 45 percent and the job market is shrinking, he added. \nThe rial has sunk to 42,900 against the U.S. dollar from 36,000 a year ago. Rouhani\u2019s administration might support the currency by spending more of Iran\u2019s foreign reserves, but this would risk deterring foreign investment; the International Monetary Fund warned against such a policy last month. \nEmadi blamed much of the economy\u2019s poor performance on a deep-rooted structural issue: the influence of paramilitary bodies such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as well as religious institutions on business. \nThose interests, which according to some estimates control over 60 percent of assets in Iran, generally do not pay taxes and stifle competition from small private companies, blocking job creation, he said. \nEmadi said Rouhani\u2019s administration was addressing this problem, pressing institutions to open their books to tax audits and demanding more transparency in the business world. \nBut Badawi predicted the government would find it hard to secure any quick improvement in the economy. \nWhile it may announce a stimulus package to create jobs, it is unlikely to backtrack on cash handouts, and problems such as diversifying the economy and repairing a debt-burdened banking system can only be solved in the long term, he said. \n\u201cMy guess is that nothing significant will change. The government will try to be open with people, to propose initiatives, but there are structural problems - diversification, the banking problem and relations with the rest of world, especially Trump.\u201d Reporting by Andrew Torchia; Editing by Robin Pomeroy"}

By early December, foreign holdings of Treasury bills had hit a record 338 billion Egyptian pounds ($19 billion), up from 532 million pounds in mid-2016, central bank data showed. \nIn U.S. dollar terms, foreign holdings of Treasury bills are now nearly three times the previous high in 2010 - with about half the investment coming in the last few months of 2017. \nCharles Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital, estimates the Egyptian pound is 16 percent undervalued compared to its long-term average and with inflation coming down from its 2017 peak of 33 percent, Egypt remains one of the most attractive emerging markets. \nThe stock market, which has a capitalisation of $45 billion, has also benefited from net inflows of foreign funds, which came to 7.5 billion pounds in 2017, the highest since a record 8.4 billion pounds in 2010, according to exchange data. \nSince the pound floated on Nov. 3, 2016 - slumping from 8.8 to the dollar to 17.7 now - the Egyptian blue-chip index has climbed more than 70 percent. \nRobertson expects the rally to continue for the next two years now the shock of the 2016 currency devaluation has passed, economic growth is picking up and high inflation is receding. DIRECT INVESTMENT \nMore importantly for Egypt\u2019s longer-term stability, investment by foreign companies and acquisitions by foreign private equity firms are rising - the kind of commitment that is less likely to be affected by short-term market fluctuations. \nEconomists say the fact Egypt has a population above 90 million, the third highest in Africa behind Nigeria and Ethiopia, coupled with a young and growing labour force make it an attractive destination. \nNet inflows of foreign direct investment into Egypt came to $7.9 billion in the year to the end of June, according to government data, helped by the energy sector. While below the government\u2019s $10 billion target, it was the fourth annual increase in a row and the highest since $8.1 billion in 2008-09. \nInflows peaked at $13.2 billion in 2007-08 before plummeting to $2.2 billion in 2011 during the Arab Spring uprising that ousted long-serving President Hosni Mubarak, disrupted the economy and ushered in years of political instability. \nPartly because of the improving outlook for gas supplies and a growing solar power industry, foreign private equity firms are expecting a surge in investment in the energy sector. \nHashem Fouad, chief investment officer at Dubai-based Enara Capital, said his firm was working with Chinese interests on opportunities in Egypt. \n\u201cWe achieved financial closes worth $200 million in the renewable energy sector in 2017 and expect more deals this year,\u201d he said. \nOthers are focusing on sectors likely to benefit as the economy expands, and exporters helped by the weaker currency. Solh at Gulf Capital said his firm was looking at companies in healthcare, education, water and food. \n\u201cWe are backing companies that are very export-oriented, earning hard currencies in dollars or euros so we are partially hedged to the currency,\u201d he said. \nGateway Partners is also focusing on export-orientated sectors and consumer industries. \n\u201cWe believe sectors related to consumer - retail, real estate, healthcare and education - and export manufacturing industries like textiles, agri-processing, and many other manufactured products are attractive,\u201d said Malas. \nThe impact of the devaluation on exports and imports, coupled with the surge in foreign fund inflows, has also helped Egypt start to address the chronic trade deficit and balance of payments problems that have plagued the country for a decade. \nThe central bank\u2019s foreign reserves surged to $37 billion in December from just over $24 billion a year earlier, while gross domestic product growth accelerated to 5.2 percent in the July-September quarter from 3.4 percent a year ago.

Reuters had previously reported Spotify was aiming to file for an IPO in late 2017 and list with the New York Stock Exchange early this year. \nSpotify declined to comment. \nSpotify was sued by Wixen Music Publishing Inc last week for allegedly using thousands of songs without a license and compensation to the music publisher. Wixen is seeking damages worth at least $1.6 billion. \nSpotify intends to proceed with a U.S. direct listing in the first half of 2018 despite the lawsuit, according to a source familiar with the matter. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Allen & Co are helping arrange the listing, the source added. \nThe lawsuit is unlikely to have a major impact on Spotify\u2019s IPO, said Luke DeMarte, a copyright lawyer at Michael Best & Friedrich not involved. DeMarte said he expects Wixen to settle its case for far less than the damages it is seeking and that it is unlikely any of the publisher lawsuits go to trial. \n\u201cIt is not in Wixen\u2019s interests or its constituents\u2019 interests to stop Spotify or really inflict harm on them because it is the main game in town for streaming,\u201d DeMarte said. \nThe company said in June it had more than 140 million active users while listing more than 30 million songs. Spotify last reported more than 60 million paid users, twice that of Apple Music, its closest rival. Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York and Liana B.

While lacking a singular message, demonstrators' ire is clearly focused on the Islamist regime.\nThe question is: What should the rest of the world do about it?\nThat's actually a question for the U.S., since few others will make a substantive move without taking a cue from the White House. In fact, Europe probably cannot be relied on to do much of anything at all since so many E.U. nations have tight economic ties to the Islamist regime; ties that became even tighter as soon as the nuclear deal was sealed in 2016.\nThe answer for the Trump team comes from that old adage about how 80 percent of life is just showing up. In this case, \"showing up\" means making sure the protesters in Iran are never in doubt that the U.S. supports them.\nSo far, President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have done just that with multiple tweets, backed up by an official State Department statement.\nThat may not seem substantial, but the recent track record on these kinds of issues says otherwise. Widespread protests against the Iranian government that erupted in 2009 eventually died when the government responded harshly. Just when public support from the Obama administration was needed most, none came.\n\"The answer for the Trump team comes from that old adage about how 80 percent of life is just showing up. In this case, \"showing up\" means making sure the protesters in Iran are never in doubt that the U.S. supports them.\" Even former chairman of the Joint Chiefs under President Obama Mike Mullen said in a TV interview this weekend that, \"I think we chose to not be as supportive as we could have been then. And I hope we can be right now so that Iran can continue to evolve.\"\nThat was in sharp contrast to President Obama's strong vocal support for pro-democracy protesters in Egypt in 2011 during the so-called Arab Spring. Obama's encouraging words for those protesters bolstered them as they eventually succeeded in carrying out a more democratic election. Two years later, Obama switched to the silent treatment. He backed away from that new Egyptian government, led by the Muslim Brotherhood, and signaled with his silence that the U.S. would not move to block a military coup d'etat.\nWhen it comes to U.S. presidents, words and the lack of words really do matter.\nBut several former Obama administration officials are publicly calling for President Trump to stay silent about the Iran protests. They say the Iranian people are so generally opposed to President Trump that his support for the protests will kill their chances for success.\nSadly, that argument is embarrassing. Are Trump's enemies in this country so deluded as to believe that his open support would actually taint the Iranian people's desire for more democracy, a stronger economy, women's rights and free speech? Many of these protesters aren't even letting the Islamist leaders get away with using the age-old Arab-Israeli conflict as an excuse to deflect from their domestic corruption.\nTo that end, there is absolutely nothing these protesters are asking for that the U.S. under any president shouldn't be publicly supporting. Again by contrast, the 2011 Egyptian protest movement was much more fraught with voices calling for more Islamism or repression of women. These Iranian protests may be a lot less organized and focused, but no ideological red flags are evident right now.\nDoes the Trump team need to do more than tweet and make statements? Absolutely. Some of the other strategies should include working to remotely restore internet service in Iran using satellites , and at least trying to identify and contact some actual leaders of this protest movement.\nA more aggressive follow up could be to stretch the mullahs to the brink by ramping up military opposition to Iran's proxies in Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. The U.S. has been in a basic state of war with Iran since 1979 with billions of dollars and many lives lost on both sides. The idea than any of those added efforts are some kind of wild escalation of hostilities between our two countries ignores the hard facts.\nBut those moves are basically the other 20 percent. It's easy to say public statements of support don't add up to much, but that sentiment has been proven wrong by Egypt's recent history and the Trump team's even more recent recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's true capital. With that in mind, no wonder Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wants President Trump to keep quiet.\nRouhani wants the protesters to shut up too. Defying him is up to those very courageous people in Iran. Luckily for President Trump, he has a much easier job in not giving Rouhani what he wants. He should keep it up.\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist. Follow him on Twitter @jakejakeny .\n Twitter."}

Wednesday's decision does not address that issue.\nThe appeals court's ruling likely doesn't end the long-running dispute over the bureau.\nRichard Hunt, CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association, said \"we applaud\" the decision but the group sees further adjustments as warranted.\n\"Congress should create a bipartisan commission at the CFPB, in place of a sole director, to uphold the Bureau's mission of consumer protection and would establish transparency, diversity of thought, additional industry insight and rule makings beneficial to consumers, the industry and the economy,\" Hunt said in a statement.\nThe president has said the bureau has overreached in its enforcement of financial system regulations. Trump has sought a less restrictive environment on a number of fronts but particularly banking, which he sees as key to generating more economic development.\nIn making its ruling, the court rejected the argument that the president could remove the CFPB director without cause. The ruling stated that a provision of the Dodd-Frank reforms, passed after the financial crisis of 2008, \"shielding the Director of the CFPB from removal without cause is consistent\" with Article II of the Constitution.\nDodd-Frank states that the director can be removed only for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\"\nCNBC has reached out to the White House for comment."}

The headquarters of Siemens AG is seen before the company's annual news conference in Munich, Germany, November 9, 2017. REUTERS\/Michael Dalder\/File Photo \nThe Frankfurt listing of a minority stake in Healthineers, which makes X-ray and MRI machines, is expected to be Germany\u2019s biggest IPO this year. It is likely to be announced in the first few days of March, with an initial public offering taking place four weeks later, the sources said. \nSiemens, which is expected to sell 15-25 percent of Healthineers, declined to comment. \nWorld stock markets are close to all-time highs with the combination of solid global growth and low inflation powering the appetite for risk, but some investors worry the rally may be nearing an end. \n\u201cCompanies with IPO plans are now trying to get out of the door fast to avoid missing the opportunity in the event of a market correction,\u201d an equity capital markets banker said. \nThe German 2018 IPO pipeline looks strong after a lacklustre 2017, when the country saw only 11 IPOs with total proceeds of 2.7 billion euros, pushing Germany\u2019s share of European IPOs down to 6 percent from 16 percent a year earlier. \nIf markets hold, Healthineers will be one of a number of blockbuster flotations in Germany this year. \nHealthineers\u2019 listing is aimed at enabling it to raise its own funds for takeovers and investments in the healthcare sector as well as crystallising its standalone value, removing some of the \u201cconglomerate discount\u201d that weighs on Siemens\u2019 valuation. \nBut Healthineers will be vying for investor attention with the IPO of brake systems maker Knorr-Bremse, which is seen worth 13-15 billion euros and Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset management arm DWS, whose listing could value the unit at 8 billion euros. \nSpringerNature, the publisher of science magazines Nature and Scientific American and estimated to be worth 4 billion-5 billion euros, is working on a stock market listing too, while German home shopping TV network HSE24 is targeting an IPO that could value it at 1.5 billion euros. \nSmaller IPOs such as those of non-prescription drugmaker Dermapharm, machine tool maker United Grinding Group, residential property developer Instone and caravan maker Knaus Tabbert are also in the works. \nSiemens aims to discuss its plans for Healthineers at a capital markets day on Jan. 16. That will be followed by a separate presentation to analysts tasked with calculating a company valuation several weeks ahead of the official announcement of the IPO. \nChief Executive Joe Kaeser said late last year that Siemens was testing the appetite of sovereign wealth funds ahead of Healthineers IPO, possibly to secure anchor investors for the flotation. \n($1 = 0.8343 euros)"}

No question.\u201d \nFormer world number one Boris Becker believes a \u201c100 percent comeback\u201d is possible for Murray, although the German says he might be regretting leaving the surgery so long. \nMurray had hoped to avoid going under the knife, saying it would not necessarily achieve a positive outcome, but finally decided it was his only realistic option because he had been in constant pain for six months. \n\u201cWith a good surgery and a good recovery a 100 percent comeback is more than possible,\u201d Becker, who will be working as a Eurosport analyst at the Open, told Reuters. \n\u201dLleyton Hewitt had it, Tommy Haas had it, just to mention a few who came back and played strong.

At the same time, the labor market, which is already the tightest among major economies, is only set to get tighter as the nation\u2019s population both shrivels and ages rapidly.\nAnd as annual negotiations with labor unions start to ramp up, there are signs that some big companies may be bending as Abe pushes for increases of 3 percent or more, though others are still expected to drag their feet.\nLast year, the average increase among 312 major companies was 2.11 percent before bonuses, according to labor ministry figures. Successive years of tiny, or even zero, wage increases may be coming to an end at some companies at least \u2013 which in turn could provide consumer spending and inflation with a welcome boost this year.\nFor example, Asahi Group Holdings ( 2502.T ) plans to raise wages by 3 percent at its beer-making operation and by 3.4 percent at its unit that produces soft drinks.\nLast year Asahi raised wages at its beer-making unit by 2.9 percent. Data on wage gains at its soft drink unit was not immediately available.\n\u201cThis is a result of management\u2019s thoughts about how we should treat our employees,\u201d President Akiyoshi Koji told reporters at a reception for corporate executives to mark the start of the new year. He denied that the move was influenced by the government\u2019s request to raise wages, saying: \u201cAn increase in disposable income helps improve the economy.\u201d\nSome other companies are discussing whether to abide by Abe\u2019s call.\nSlideshow (3 Images) \u201cI want to debate this and do as much as possible to make sure disposable incomes rise,\u201d Hitachi Ltd ( 6501.T ) Chief Executive Toshiaki Higashihara told reporters at a new year\u2019s reception on Friday. \u201cI approve of raising disposable incomes, because in the end this will improve the economy by raising consumption.\u201d\nTAX INCENTIVES Japan\u2019s Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said on Friday he is confident that the conditions are ripe for increases. \u201cOur policies have created the environment necessary for companies to use their record-high corporate earnings to raise wages and increase investment,\u201d he told reporters on Friday after a cabinet meeting. \u201cI strongly believe our changes to the tax code will encourage companies to take bold steps to raise wages and capital expenditure.\u201d\nAbe\u2019s government plans to introduce legislation to the regular session of parliament later this month that will lower the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from around 30 percent for companies that raise wages by 3 percent or more. The incentive will appeal to some large companies, but it is unlikely to work with some others who already pay an effective rate below 25 percent. There are also many small companies that have effective tax rates well below 25 percent.\nThe legislation, which is almost certain to pass into law, will also cut taxes for companies that invest in cutting-edge technology.\nThe tax breaks are the latest carrot Abe\u2019s government has dangled in front of Japanese companies to convince them to help with his agenda aimed at reflating the economy. Since taking office in late 2012, Abe has appealed directly to the largest business lobbies to raise wages at annual negotiations with unions that take place in the spring. Abe\u2019s overriding goal is to make sure consumers have enough money in their pockets to keep spending - vanquishing the threat of deflation and making it easier to meet the Bank of Japan\u2019s 2 percent inflation target. In November, the core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food, rose only 0.9 percent from the same period a year earlier. Economists say there are many reasons why companies like Hitachi can afford to raise wages.\nAs well as strong corporate profits, cash and reserves held by Japanese companies stood at an eye-popping record of 1,207 trillion yen ($10.7 trillion) in the third quarter, according to central bank data. Meanwhile, Japan\u2019s jobless rate is 2.7 percent, the lowest since November 1993 and by far the lowest among Group of Seven countries. The shrinking of the working-age population will eventually force companies to raise wages to compete for workers, economists say. But not all companies share the optimism about wages and many firms will come in below the 3 percent increase the government is looking for, economists say. This should still be enough to keep consumer spending on track to rise this year, which will make it easier to achieve faster inflation. \u201cAbe is taking these steps because so far wages have lagged the improvement in the real economy,\u201d said Kentaro Arita, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. \u201cThe elements needed to raise wages are falling into place, but one thing that is lacking for some companies is confidence about the future.

(NYSE:RPM) today reported record sales, net income and diluted earnings per share for its fiscal 2018 second quarter ended November 30, 2017. Sales increased 10.5% and net income of $95.5 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared to a year-ago net loss of $70.9 million, or loss of $0.54 per diluted share. The fiscal 2017 second-quarter results included a $188.3 million pre-tax ($129.2 million or $0.97 per diluted share, after-tax) impairment charge. The fiscal 2017 second-quarter results also included a charge of $12.3 million, or $0.09 per share, which had no tax impact, related to the decision to exit an industrial segment business in the Middle East.\nSecond-Quarter Results\nNet sales of $1.32 billion were up 10.5% over the $1.19 billion reported a year ago. Organic sales improved 4.2% and acquisition growth added 4.7%. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 1.6%. Net income of $95.5 million compares to last year\u2019s adjusted net income of $70.5 million. Earnings per diluted share of $0.70 in the current quarter, which included a $0.09 per diluted share tax benefit relative to last year\u2019s tax rate, compare to an adjusted $0.52 per diluted share last year. Earnings per diluted share increased 34.6% from last year\u2019s adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.52, and increased 17.3% excluding the $0.09 per diluted share tax benefit. Income before income taxes (IBT) of $109.2 million compares to a loss before income taxes of $106.9 million reported in the fiscal 2017 second quarter. RPM's consolidated earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $131.8 million compare to a consolidated loss before interest and taxes of $86.4 million reported in the fiscal 2017 second quarter. Excluding the year-ago charges, RPM\u2019s consolidated EBIT for the fiscal 2018 second quarter improved 15.4% over $114.2 million in the fiscal 2017 second quarter. The EBIT improvement of 15.4% included the cost savings benefit in \u201cCorporate\/Other\u201d expenses of $11.1 million from lower pension, healthcare, acquisition-related expenses and professional fees.\n\u201cWe were very pleased with RPM\u2019s results during the fiscal second quarter. Our strategically balanced business model performed as intended with strength in our industrial and specialty businesses offsetting weakness in our consumer segment. Sales growth was strong across all three of our business segments, with a balance of organic and acquisition growth. We are also seeing the benefits of last year\u2019s product line acquisitions and cost reduction efforts on improved leverage, which more than offset higher raw material costs that have negatively impacted gross profit margins,\u201d stated Frank C. Sullivan, chairman and chief executive officer.\nSecond-Quarter Segment Sales and Earnings\nDuring the fiscal 2018 second quarter, industrial segment sales increased 11.0%, to $702.9 million from $633.4 million in the fiscal 2017 second quarter. Organic sales improved 5.4%, while acquisition growth added 3.3%. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 2.3%. IBT for the industrial segment increased 34.6%, to $67.7 million from $50.3 million in the fiscal 2017 second quarter. Industrial segment EBIT increased 34.5%, to $70.2 million from $52.2 million in the fiscal 2017 second quarter. Industrial segment EBIT was up 8.9% over an adjusted $64.5 million in the fiscal 2017 second quarter, excluding last year\u2019s charge to exit a Middle Eastern flooring business.\n\u201cOur strong organic sales growth of 5.4% in the industrial segment was driven by North American roofing and those businesses providing polymer flooring to commercial and industrial markets. We also saw a slight rebound in our companies serving the oil and gas industry, which reported positive organic year-over-year sales growth for the first time in three years. We continue to see mixed results from our industrial businesses in Europe, while Latin American industrial operations, particularly in Brazil, continue to struggle. EBIT margins were negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable transactional foreign currency exchange,\u201d Sullivan stated.\nRPM\u2019s fiscal 2018 second-quarter consumer segment sales increased 11.1%, to $415.4 million from $373.8 million a year ago. Organic sales increased 3.0%, while acquisition growth added 7.3%. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.8%. The consumer segment had IBT of $45.1 million, compared to a loss before income taxes of $140.6 million in the fiscal 2017 second quarter. The segment reported EBIT of $45.2 million, compared to a loss before interest and taxes of $140.6 million reported last year. EBIT was off 5.3% from an adjusted $47.7 million in the fiscal 2017 second quarter, which excludes the impairment charge related to RPM\u2019s consumer nail enamel business.\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we saw a sharp uptick in business from caulks and sealants products, as well as some international markets. The segment also benefited from last year\u2019s acquisitions of Touch \u2018N Foam in the U.S. and SPS in Europe. The decline in EBIT resulted from higher raw material costs and unfavorable manufacturing absorption and product mix,\u201d stated Sullivan.\nSecond-quarter sales for the specialty segment increased 7.4%, to $197.1 million from $183.6 million in the fiscal 2017 second quarter. Organic growth was 2.8%, while acquisitions added 3.8%. Foreign currency translation increased sales by 0.8%. IBT for the specialty segment increased 10.5%, to $34.4 million from $31.2 million in the fiscal 2017 second quarter. Specialty segment EBIT improved 10.8%, to $34.4 million from $31.0 million a year ago.\n\u201cWe experienced strong growth in many of our specialty segment product lines, particularly U.S.-based restoration service businesses, with higher than normal sales volumes into the hurricane impacted regions prior to and after the storms, as well as powder coatings and wood finishes, after overcoming lost sales from last year\u2019s closure of an unprofitable European business and recent patent expiration. We were able to mitigate the negative impact of the patent expiration by retaining most of our larger customers,\u201d Sullivan stated.\nCash Flow and Financial Position\nFor the first half of fiscal 2018, cash from operations was $115.2 million, compared to $158.7 million a year ago. Capital expenditures of $45.3 million compared to $48.0 million during the first half of last year. Total debt at November 30, 2017 was $2.14 billion, compared to $1.64 billion at November 30, 2016 and $2.1 billion at May 31, 2017. RPM\u2019s net (of cash) debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 53.8%, compared to 52.8% at November 30, 2016. At November 30, 2017, liquidity stood at $971.7 million, including cash of $267.9 million and $703.8 mi"}

I thought in terms of, 'Lots people that want to invest lots of money and they're all coming back to the United States \u2014 they're coming back to America.' And I thought of it much more in those terms.\nAfter I said that I was going, there were massive stories about 'the elite' and 'the globalists' and the planes flying in and everything else. It's not about that. It's about coming to America, investing in money, creating jobs, companies coming in. We're setting records \u2014 every week, every day \u2014 we're setting records. You see what's going on: Apple now with $350 billion dollars \u2014 most people thought they meant $350 million, which would build a nice plant.

They're gonna do a lot.\"\nAs the world's most valuable company, Apple was already expected to be a huge economic driver in the U.S. over the next five years. But the move certainly softens the tough relationship that developed between Apple and Trump on the campaign trail.\nLess than two years ago, Trump said his supporters should boycott Apple, because of the company's stance on encryption in a terrorism investigation. Later in 2016, then President-elect Trump publicly called out Apple's reliance on China in The New York Times .\n\u2014 Reporting by CNBC's Joe Kernan"}

It sells ads and promotes content from some publishers, which means it stands to make cash off of the most popular news stories ... no matter how accurate they are.\nSadly, that has led news organizations to use Facebook as a means to drive traffic, but not to create an established audience.\nThe Verge's Casey Newton hit the nail right on the head:\nread tweet \nOr this one, from The Information's Jessica Lessin, nails it again:\ntweet \nI remember, for example, that there used to be an easy way to game Facebook traffic to a news site simply by writing about any of the trending stories posted on the news feed. It drove crazy amounts of people to blogs and other organizations, but never people who came back.\nAnd as for the fake news problem, Facebook even admits that earlier attempts to stop it from spreading actually did the exact opposite. In a blog post last month, Facebook product manager Tessa Lyons said that red flags that it posted next to stories that were meant to identify false news were actually doing the opposite.\n\"Academic research on correcting misinformation has shown that putting a strong image, like a red flag, next to an article may actually entrench deeply held beliefs \u2013 the opposite effect to what we intended,\" Lyons said. \nYikes.\nFacebook has forced the hands of some news organizations to change for the worse \u2014 pivoting to sometimes short but often unimportant videos about cats in pajamas instead of real topics, like what's on the front page of The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNBC, Bloomberg and other established first-rate news organizations.\nMake no mistake: It would have devastating effects on sites that rely on Facebook for traffic and revenue. It'll also force publishers to get back to what we do best \u2014 what we're supposed to be doing in the first place \u2014 reporting first and generating traffic second (we do need to pay the bills after all, right?). It'll create new traffic that accumulates through an audience who wants to return because they expect high quality content. (Obviously, Facebook can't stop users from sharing news articles in their feeds.)\nOtherwise we face another problem: The possibility of requiring some sort of government regulation of Facebook's news feed. That would help cut down on propaganda and fake news, but it also sets a dangerous precedent where the government might one day be able to regulate more of the news media, whether it's on Facebook or other platforms.\nFacebook says it's moving away from news, and that's a step, but it's time for it to shut down the news operation entirely."}

Economists warn that undoing the law would cost billions of euros and alarm financial markets.\nBut the law is highly unpopular with Italians and the Northern League, led by Matteo Salvini, has made its repeal its number one priority. \u201cCancelling the Fornero Law (is) in the center-right program. Mission accomplished,\u201d Salvini wrote on Twitter on Sunday.\nHe also said that the three parties had agreed to expel all illegal migrants and \u201ctake control\u201d of the country\u2019s borders, which are currently covered by the EU free-travel Schengen zone.\nSunday\u2019s statement made no reference to another League proposal - exiting the euro currency - but did commit the conservative bloc to introducing an unspecified flat tax.\nThe Northern League has called for a 15 percent flat tax, while Berlusconi has proposed a flat rate of between 20 and 25 percent. Income tax bands currently run from 23 to 43 percent.\nThe bloc has given no indication of how it intends to pay for its program, saying only that by lowering the tax rate, more people will pay up, raising the overall tax take.\nEconomy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan told Corriere della Sera newspaper on Sunday that the proposed flat tax was \u201cnot sustainable\u201d.\nWith the election less than two months away, all Italian parties are looking to win votes with eye-catching ideas.\nThe ruling center-left Democratic Party suggested last week that it might abolish the television license fee, while the leftist Free and Equal party on Sunday proposed making university education free for all.\nReporting by Crispian Balmer, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n "}

Over the course of 2018, negotiators from around the world will be working through the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that undergirds the Paris Agreement, to do something similar.\nAt the top of their to-do list are rules for what the UN calls \u201ctransparency\u201d \u2014 that is, rules for measuring countries\u2019 emissions, and for measuring their progress toward reducing that pollution.\nWhen each country signed on to the agreement, it offered a goal, or a \u201cnational determined contribution,\u201d stating how much it planned to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Over time, countries are expected to improve on those pledges. The Paris Agreement's objective is that these goals will gradually add up to a large enough reduction in global emissions that global warming can be contained within 2 degrees Celsius (36 degrees Fahrenheit.)\nTransparency is essential to determine whether that 2-degree target is realistic. Practically speaking, the UN needs to figure out how countries will report their progress toward their emission-cutting goals. It will also need to figure out how to determine whether those reports are accurate. This will mean digging into topics that, during past rounds of negotiations, have proven to be complex and technically intricate.\nWhen it comes to reporting, \u201cthe Paris Agreement itself essentially points to a common approach for countries but also acknowledges a need for flexibility for the countries that need it,\u201d says David Waskow, head of the DC-based World Resources Institute\u2019s International Climate Initiative. That \u201ccommon approach\u201d is key, and something that U.S. diplomats representing both Republican and Democratic administrations have pushed for years. If the UN has different standards for different countries \u2014 for instance, if it holds India and China to lower transparency standards than the European Union \u2014 then the agreement will be weakened at a time when it needs to get much stronger.\nThe flip side of those common reporting standards is flexibility. By allowing for some variation in the information that countries report, the UN acknowledges that not every country will be able to measure their greenhouse gas emissions with the same degree of accuracy.\nA man wears an anti-particle mask to protect himself from air pollution in Skopje, Macedonia December 15, 2017. REUTERS\/Ognen Teofilovski A national government, Waskow explains, needs \u201cto know basic data about not only power plants but industrial facilities, what\u2019s happening with transportation systems and vehicles, what kind of fuels are being used, what\u2019s happening in the agriculture sector, what\u2019s happening with land use, et cetera. It requires government capacity not only at the national level but at the sub-national level \u2014 the city and state and provincial level \u2014 to be able to know what power plants and industrial facilities are in operation and at what level they\u2019re producing and emitting.\u201d\nNot every county has that capacity. The specifics of how the UN deals with the range of data available is one of the things that must be figured out in 2018.\nOne of the goals of the Paris Agreement is that every country eventually will be able to report information with the same degree of accuracy. Initially, however, that won\u2019t be the case. So negotiators this year will have to write rules that require strong, accurate reports, but that leave developing countries some wiggle room.\nA street cleaner works in heavy smog in Delhi, India, November 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Cathal McNaughton Negotiators will also have to figure out how the UN will measure emissions outside national borders, including those from airplanes and boats in international waters. Planes and boats together account for about four percent of global emissions, by some estimates, and both air travel and maritime cargo shipping are expected to increase in coming years. Measuring these emissions will likely involve greater use of technology, especially satellites that can measure carbon dioxide and other climate change-causing pollutants from space.\nA further complicating factor is the rule-writing role of the United States and China, the two countries that head the Paris Agreement\u2019s committee on transparency and which are also the world\u2019s top two carbon emitters. Washington has historically championed stronger transparency, but whether State Department diplomats will remain as invested in the issue given the nation\u2019s current one-foot-out-the-door status is unclear.\nChina, meanwhile, has at times balked at efforts to assess its role in climate change. In the past, the country has shared its own internal statistics on emissions but has refused to answer questions about how those statistics were calculated. China\u2019s data on coal use, a major contributor to its greenhouse gas emissions, has not always been reliable, and, at times, the country has dramatically revised past reports. But Chinese President Xi Jinping is trying to position his country as a global leader on climate change, a mantle the United States dropped when President Obama left office. Whether that means advocating for stronger transparency rules remains to be seen.\nUltimately, if the UN ends 2018 with strong rules on transparency, countries will have greater faith in the Paris Agreement. They\u2019ll know, with greater certainty, that what they\u2019re doing is making a difference.\nLooking beyond 2018, countries will begin offering up stronger and stronger emissions-cutting pledges. Once the rules are written, those undertakings are \u201cthe other critical task,\u201d says Waskow. \u201cThose together will put the Paris Agreement fully into motion and make it a living, breathing thing with real consequence.\u201d\nThe transparency rules will not just determine whether the world avoids a dangerous level of climate change \u2014 they will determine whether countries have faith in the UN\u2019s delicate effort to protect the planet.\nAbout the Author John Light is a journalist based in New York.

But the average SALT deduction for taxpayers in New York, New Jersey and California has been about $20,000. Politicians in blue states across the country are devising ways to workaround the federal code. SHARES Getty Images Residents wait in line to pay taxes at the Fairfax County Government Center December 28, 2017 in Fairfax, Virginia. \nOfficials in New York, New Jersey and California are working to reshape their tax codes to ease residents' pain from new limits to federal deductions for state, local and property taxes. \nStarting this year, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , the GOP's new tax code, caps taxpayers' deductions on their property, state and local incomes taxes (SALT) \u200aat $10,000. \nBut in 2015, the average New Yorker's SALT deduction was more than $22,000 . In New Jersey and California, the average deductions were around $18,000. \nPreviously, there was no limit on the extent to which taxpayers could deduct these local levies. The change means many residents in these states \u2014 and many others \u2014 will now pay more to the federal government. (See chart below.) \n\"We're attempting to come up with ways to negate and blunt the harsh and unfair Republican tax policy,\" said Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the Democratic leader of the California State Senate. \nTo combat the new SALT deduction cap, politicians are proposing creative concepts. Some of the ideas include granting a charitable deduction \u2014 which remains uncapped \u2014 after filers pay property taxes. Another idea does away with income taxes and applies a statewide payroll tax to be paid for by employers \u2014 which is deductible to them. \n\"The whole intent is to ensure that you get the benefit of the deduction you would otherwise lose,\" said Joseph Bankman, the Ralph M. Parsons Professor of Law and Business at Stanford Law School. \nThe White House has expressed its disapproval. \n\"I hope that the states are more focused on cutting their budgets and giving tax cuts to their people in their states than they are in trying to evade the law,\" said Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Treasury Secretary, at a press briefing this month. \"The whole intent is to ensure that you get the benefit of the deduction you would otherwise lose.\" -Joseph Bankman, Professor, Stanford Law School \nHowever, Robert Mujica, New York's budget director, said it's impossible for the state to not react. \n\"What Washington did to New York was say 'We're going to basically change the laws entirely and upend your system, oh, and by the way, don't make any changes to adjust to it',\" he said. \nHere's how three key states are working to combat the new tax law. California Michael Tullberg | Getty Images California State Senate leader Kevin de Leon. \nIn early January, California Senate leader de Le\u00f3n introduced a bill that would allow residents to pay some of their state taxes to the California Excellence Fund, a state charity. In turn, taxpayers would be able to deduct the amount of their charitable contribution on their federal returns. \nSo if, say, a San Francisco resident's SALT taxes were $15,000, they could pay the first $10,000 as normal, and then contribute the remaining $5,000 of their state tax bill to the California Excellence Fund as a charitable donation. That would then make their total SALT taxes deductible. \"It means sitting down with an accountant in December instead of March.\" -Brian Galle, Professor of law, Georgetown University \n\"It's pretty easy,\" said Brian Galle, a law professor at Georgetown University who specializes in taxation. \"It follows a mechanism that many taxpayers have done every year.\" \nWhat might require adjustment is that people would have to figure out their taxes months earlier than they're used to. That's because people would need to know their state tax bill and make that charitable contribution before the end of the year to receive the benefit. \n\"It means sitting down with an accountant in December instead of March,\" Galle said. \nEducating Californians about the system would be a major part of the plan, de Leon said. New York Getty Images New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. \nAbsent of any changes, the state estimates that New Yorkers would pay an additional $14 billion a year in taxes. \nSo earlier this month, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the Department of Taxation and Finance to craft ways for the state to respond to the GOP tax bill. The department emerged with a slew of proposals to reshape New York's taxation. \n\"All of them are designed to give back to New Yorkers what the federal government took away,\" Mujica said. \nThe first proposal basically mirrors California's plan. Residents would contribute their SALT taxes beyond the $10,000 cap to a state charity, and therefore make their entire bill eligible for deduction. \nThe other major proposal would shift income taxes to payroll taxes \u2014 or from employees who can no longer deduct taxes to employers who still can. \nEmployers, facing a higher tax bill, would most likely reduce wages. But the state would give employees a wage credit, which would be deductible. \"What Washington did to New York was say 'We're going to basically change the laws entirely and upend your system, oh, and by the way, don't make any changes to adjust to it'\" -Robert Mujica, Director, New York State Division of the Budget \nSo if an employee makes $75,000 a year, and the employer lowers her salary to $65,000 because it's now paying a new payroll tax, the state would give the employee a wage credit for $10,000. The employee is back where she started (at $75,000) \u2014 but now she has her state taxes shielded from federal taxation. \nThis proposal could reach more people than the charitable deduction, Galle said. \n\"You might be benefiting all your constituents,\" he said. \"Not just the ones who itemize.\" Although it might require workers to accept an immediate pay cut. \nMujica said these proposals are a top priority for the state. \n\"We'd like to get legislative drafted in the next few weeks,\" he said.

It also said it would lay off thousands of workers and close dozens of Sam\u2019s Club stores.\nThe tax law was Trump\u2019s first major legislative achievement since he took office in January last year, and it slashes the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.\nThe tax package, approved despite the unanimous opposition of Democrats, helped drive stock market gains in the last months of 2017. The momentum has continued in 2018, and there are widespread expectations that investors will overlook fourth-quarter charges and focus on upbeat corporate outlooks.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019ll see is companies will take a one-time hit, but it\u2019s not going to have a bearing on stock price movements,\u201d said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York. \u201cThey will talk about 2018, and we feel pretty confident it will be a win to a big win for U.S. companies.\u201d\nEstimates for 2018 S&P 500 earnings have risen more than 2 percentage points since the beginning of the year, partly due to analysts factoring in the impact of the tax code changes.\nProfit growth for the year is forecast at 14.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, while analysts expect fourth-quarter earnings to have risen 11.8 percent from a year ago.\nWINNERS IN ENERGY The energy sector is expected to post the biggest year-over-year gain in earnings. Estimates have risen in recent weeks following a surge in oil prices, which this week climbed to their highest level in three years.\nIn the short term, many companies are expected to take one-time charges against earnings because of the tax bill, which includes a one-time tax on an estimated $2.6 trillion in profits held offshore by multinationals.\nAmong early reporters, Delta Air Lines said on Thursday that it was taking a one-time charge of $150 million on tax code changes. It said the new tax law would lower its tax rate to between 22 percent and 24 percent in 2018, and that it expects the tax cuts to help drive business demand. Delta\u2019s stock rose on Thursday, as did other airlines\u2019 shares.\nUnder the new law, companies with earnings parked offshore will face a one-time tax of 15.5 percent on cash and equivalents and 8 percent on illiquid assets, payable over eight years.\nIn the future, domestic corporate profits will be taxed at 21 percent, while most foreign profits will no longer be taxed, within some limits. The new law also allows companies to write off immediately the full value of new capital investments.\nBANKS TO ADJUST Banks and other companies will need to remeasure the value of their deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new tax rate, a note from strategists at Goldman Sachs said.\nFor instance, JPMorgan Chase & Co,, which will be the first big bank to give results when it reports on Friday, could show a 35 percent plunge in net income from a year earlier, based on analysts\u2019 estimates.\nTechnology and healthcare companies are sitting on the largest stash of overseas cash and are expected to post the biggest charges related to the one-time repatriation tax, Goldman strategists wrote.\nApple \u201cwill incur the largest tax bill of any company under the provision, owing $33 billion on its $216 billion of overseas cash,\u201d they wrote.\nAs a group, the technology sector, which led the market\u2019s rally in 2017, is expected to benefit less from the tax rate cut than most other sectors, analysts said.\nReporting by Caroline Valetkevitch; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Daniel Wallis\n "}

Asia-Pacific excluding Japan also scaled a decade-high peak as a fifth day of gains in China helped emerging market stocks to a 6-1\/2 year high as well.\n\u201cIt is a continuation of the goldilocks story,\u201d said State Street Global Markets\u2019 head of macro strategy Michael Metcalfe.\n\u201cThe main theme last year was strong growth and accommodative (monetary) policy and the data we have had so far suggest that the growth is expected to accelerate, and without inflation.\u201d\nThe data published on Thursday reinforced expectations that solid world growth will boost demand for goods, including oil, and lift corporate earnings.\nChina\u2019s services sector activity hit its highest level in more than three years, manufacturing data from Japan came in strong and euro zone surveys showed the bloc enjoying its strongest run in nearly seven years.\nIHS Markit\u2019s Final Composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index - seen as a good overall growth indicator for the 19-country region - rose to 58.1 in December from 57.5 in November and up slightly from a flash estimate of 58.0.\n\u201cA stellar end to 2017 for the euro zone rounded off the best year for over a decade, continuing to confound widely held fears that rising political uncertainty would curb economic growth,\u201d Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.\nAnother factor behind the upbeat mood was that minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s mid-December meeting released on Wednesday did little to change that view that it will stick to measured increases in U.S. interest rates.\nThey showed policymakers expect U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cut plans to boost consumer spending but are still uncertain about the impact the stimulus would have on inflation.\nFed funds rate futures moved to price a 75 percent chance of a rate hike by March, compared with around 60 percent at the end of last year. But markets are still not fully pricing in the three rate increases many Fed officials expect this year.\nThe dollar climbed off a three-month low after the minutes but was backsliding again in Europe on Thursday as the euro zone and Asia data handed the initiative back to the euro and yen.\nIt left the greenback flat at 112.61 yen and the euro up 0.15 percent at $1.2033. If the single currency gets above September\u2019s peak of $1.2092 it would return to ground last trod in early 2015.\n\u201cWe see some very positive euro sentiment in the market right now,\u201d said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt in Frankfurt.\nOIL ON THE BOIL Euro zone bond yields were also creeping higher, buoyed by the data, as investors readied for new debt sales from France and Spain in what is traditionally one of the busiest issuance months of the year.\nYields on French and Spanish 10-year bonds were around 1 basis point higher. In Germany, the bloc\u2019s benchmark bond issuer, 10-year bond yields were up 1.5 bps at 0.46 percent and holding within reach of recent two-month highs.\nThe bigger focus though was on the ongoing rise in commodity prices, which often have a big influence on global inflation.\nOil prices were touching levels not seen since before commodity markets slumped in 2014\/15, having been boosted by tensions in key producer Iran and ongoing OPEC-led output cuts.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose to as high as $62.17 per barrel, up 0.9 percent for the day and their highest level since mid-2015. International benchmark Brent also scaled a 2-1\/2-year high of $68.19 a barrel.\nAt the same time, inflation expectations indicated by the gap between 10-year U.S. inflation-linked bonds and conventional ones, was above 2 percent at the highest level since March.\n\u201cOil appears to be traded at a premium compared to economic fundamentals because of concerns over development in Iran,\u201d said Motofumi Okoshi, senior economist at Nomura Securities.\nAt the moment though, forward contracts are trading cheaper than expected spot prices, a condition known as \u2018backwardation\u2019, suggesting investors expect any supply shortages to be temporary.\n\u201cIf conditions in Iran deteriorate further, I expect forward contracts will begin to be bought as well,\u201d Okoshi added.\nPolitical concerns were also supporting safe-haven gold, which fetched $1,310 per ounce, after hitting a 3-1\/2-month high of $1,321.5 on Wednesday.\nStill, investors expect financial markets to stay stable overall. The Cboe Volatility index, which measures implied price volatility of U.S. stocks in the next one month, closed at 9.15 on Wednesday, just short of its record closing low of 9.14 touched on Nov. 3.\nAdditional reporting by Jemima Kelly in London and Hideyuki Sano in London; editing by John Stonestreet\n "}

After strong gains in 2017, regional stocks rose further in 2018, helped by a global rally, Central Europe's healthy economic output and improved dividends prospects. Romania's stock index, a regional underperformer last year, leads this year's rise, with 3.1 percent gain from 2017 by 0915 GMT. Other indices took a breather around psychological levels. Budapest pierced the 40,000-point line for the first time since Nov. 24. Warsaw retreated behind 2,500 points from Thursday's two-month highs. Prague set a new 6-1\/2-year high. Analysts saw room for further gains. \"The economy is doing great,\" said Milan Vanicek, head of research at J&T Banka. \"And there are good dividend yields,\" he said. Vanicek said energy group CEZ, trading at its highest since 2015, could rise further, adding that Moneta bank would be his bet for 2018. \"Nice fundamentals, the economy is improving, and there might be already a turnaround in the numbers, meaning not declining but at least steady, and a very nice dividend,\" he said. Bank stocks rallied in the region in the past year, partly due to expectations of rising interest rates. The crown is seen leading continuing regional currency gains this year. The Czech Republic, where the central bank (CNB) has increased interest rates twice since August, sold Treasury bills on Thursday at a positive yield for the first time in two years. Czech government bond yields rose by 7-10 basis points on Friday, with the 10-year paper bid at 1.711 percent. Romania's central bank may become the first to follow the CNB's rate tightening, but Romanian yields have declined this year, with their curve steepening after an end-year government spending spree. The increased market liquidity is unlikely to prompt action at the Romanian central bank's meeting on Monday as the leu is off its end-2017 record lows, ING analysts said in a note. \"While we expect no change in policy stance, we look for central bank to telegraph February hike,\" they said. In Budapest, bond yields traded near record lows and their curve flattened after a plunge on Thursday amid robust demand at the year's first auction. Long-term yields fell because on Jan. 18 Hungary's central bank will launch long-tenor interest rate swap auctions to help the curve flatten, traders said. The 10-year paper traded at a yield of 1.89 percent, down six basis points from Thursday's fixing.

{"published":"2018-01-10T02:10:00.000+02:00","title":"January and its unusual string of new highs is setting a good tone for the market","text":"As Januarys go, this one is looking to be particularly good for stocks.\nNot since 1964 has the S&P 500 started the year with six record highs, and for the Nasdaq, it's been since 1999, according to LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick. The S&P was up 13 percent in 1964, but the Nasdaq roared ahead 85 percent in 1999, before crashing shortly after.\nThe fact that the first five trading days of the year were positive was already a good omen. Detrick, senior market strategist, said when the first five days of a new year are up 2 percent or more, the full year has been higher 15 out of 15 times. The average gain in those years has been 18.6 percent.\n\"It sure seems like there's something to it,\" said Detrick. \"Even though it's a very small sample size it does suggest if you get the ball rolling it can very well continue. The fact it was such a strong start to the year just continues to reinforce the bull market is still alive and there's probably a lot more positives than negatives as we move out into 2018.\"\nDetrick said January looks to be sizing up to a positive month overall, and as the Wall Street saying goes, \"So goes January, so goes the year.\"\n\"Off to a good start and January is higher is just one more sign this could be a double-digit equity return year for investors,\" he said.\nBut a good January doesn't mean a good February, and Detrick said there could be a pullback in February, one of the weaker months, before the market moves higher in March and April, seasonally strong months.\nJulian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said it's possible there could be a pullback even before next month. On Tuesday he released his S&P 500 year-end target of 3,000. The S&P closed Tuesday at 2,741, up 0.1 percent but up nearly 3 percent for the year so far.\n\"If it happens, January is a likely time for it,\" he said. \"I think it could happen later this month as you get closer to the government funding deadline of the 19th and a little later the [Federal Open Market Committee]. Not that the FOMC is going to be a catalyst in general, but there's a rich history of leadership transitions being a source of more volatility.\"\nThe Fed meeting Jan. 30-31 is the last to be chaired by Janet Yellen before she hands over the reins to Jerome Powell. The Fed is not expected to raise interest rates at that meeting.\nEmanuel said there was medium-term market volatility in past transitions of Fed chairs. \"[Ben] Bernanke took over in 2006. Obviously, the top came in 2007. [Alan] Greenspan on the other hand, took over in the summer of 1987, and literally you had the market crash within months of him taking over,\" he said.\nEmanuel said when Paul Volcker came in during the late 1970s, there was a massive surge in gold and interest rates.\nInterest rates could be a factor for markets Wednesday, after the 10-year broke 2.50 and hit a high of 2.55 percent Tuesday, its highest since March. The move in yields started with a move by the Bank of Japan to buy fewer bonds , which stirred speculation it was moving away from quantitative easing.\nBut strategists believe the move was more technical and the BOJ will continue its easy policies, at least for now.\nThe Treasury auctions $20 billion reopened 10-year notes at 1 p.m. ET Wednesday.\n\"I'm expecting average results. I don't think the dip buyers are going to come in just yet. We've got to see the data at the end of the week,\" said George Goncalves, head of fixed-income strategy at Nomura. CPI is reported Friday, and the markets have been awaiting inflation news.\n\"We broke through the 2.50 level [on the 10-year]. It's a psychological level. I don't think it's going to be a stellar auction,\" he said.\nStocks are being buoyed by the anticipated benefits of the tax cuts, economic growth and the prospect for strong earnings. The fourth-quarter earnings season gets underway Friday when J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo report.\nThere are a few earnings Wednesday, including KB Home , Supervalu and Progress Software .

According to Road and Track , the Mustang GT helped invent the modern cinema car chase with its appearance in the 1968 Steve McQueen film \"Bullitt,\" and to commemorate the film's 50th anniversary, Ford recently revealed a souped-up 2019 special edition called the Mustang Bullitt. \nJay Leno was lucky enough to be the first civilian, other than Steve McQueen and the car's recent owners, to drive the iconic vehicle that appeared in the film. Then Leno took a test drive of the 2019 model for good measure. \nThe dramatic story of the 1968 vehicle has as many twists and turns as the film it appeared in. After being sold in 1974 for the hefty sum of $6,000, it seemed to go missing for 40 years. In reality, it was safe and sound in the hands of private collector Robert Kiernan. Kiernan turned down many offers for the car, including a few from Steve McQueen himself, and after he passed away in 2014, Kiernan's son Sean contacted Ford to let them know where the Bullitt had been stashed away. \nWhich brings us to Jay's once-in-a-lifetime chance to hop in the driver's seat. \nThe Kiernans' goal was to leave the car exactly as it was, and according to Leno, they absolutely accomplished that mission. His bumpy ride is powered by the car's powerful 390 engine with roughly 300 horsepower. After getting the chance to settle in, Leno determines that \"it drives much worse than a 50-year-old car because nothing's been done to it. It's literally been sitting in a barn for the last 40 years at least.\" \nWith all its original parts (including the original paint job) the 1968 vehicle provides a totally different experience than the brand-new 2019 Bullitt, which packs a serious punch. Although all the specs for Ford's new model haven't been revealed yet, the V8 engine makes a grand entrance with 475 horsepower, 420 pound-feet of torque and a top speed of 163 mph. There's also the six-speed manual transmission. Mustang product marketing manager Mark Schaller says, \"It's all about a little bit more power, better handling \u2026 It's meant to be a little more discreet and a little bit under the radar.\" \nWhile the 2019 version is faster, with better balance, more horsepower and 50 years of improvements, Leno says that it still gives you the feeling you get from the movie: \"When you get in this Bullitt Mustang, you become Steve McQueen.\" \nWatch all-new episodes of \" Jay Leno's Garage \" on Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET\/PT."}

SHARES Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images President Donald Trump speaks prior to signing a Presidential Proclamation shrinking Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments at the Utah State Capitol in Salt Lake City, Utah, December 4, 2017. \nDonald Trump lifted the Dow Jones industrial average in his first year in office more than any other president since Franklin Roosevelt. \nThe Dow has surged more than 31 percent since Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017. That marks the index's best performance under a president's first year since Roosevelt. The Dow skyrocketed 96.5 percent during Roosevelt's first year in office. \n(Returns measured from the day before the inauguration.) \n\"This is all about policy,\" said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. \"You've got lower taxes, less regulation and confidence in the economy is high. Things are firing on all cylinders.\" \nTrump quickly moved to cut regulations enacted by previous administrations. He also successfully pushed to overhaul the U.S. tax code. That revamp included slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. \nThe president made it to the White House saying he would \"put America first.\" Since taking office, Trump has pushed to have companies bring back jobs to the U.S. and has said repeatedly said his policies would help to accomplish this. show chapters 30 Mins Ago | 02:20 \nThese policy and rhetoric shifts have helped the so-called old guard of the stock market rally. \nShares of Boeing and Caterpillar \u2014 both founded in the early 1900s \u2014 are up 115 percent and 82 percent respectively since Trump entered the White House. They are also the best-performing Dow stocks since Trump took office. These companies benefit greatly from lower taxes and less regulation, and tend to rise the most when people believe the economic cycle is accelerating. \nSome investors believe Trump is getting too much credit for the run-up and it's really the strength of the global economy boosting these industrial stocks. \n\"There is clearly a coincidence between Trump's election and the run-up in stock prices over the past year,\" Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, said in a note earlier this week. \"However, coinciding with Trump's victory was mounting evidence of a global synchronized boom. In our opinion, the run-up in stock prices over the past year has been a continuation of the bull market within a bull market that started on February 12, 2016.\" \nTrump doesn't see it that way often patting himself on the back about the Dow's successes during his first year in office. He's tweeted about the index at least a dozen times in the last year. The president also mentioned the Dow repeatedly in meetings and press conferences. Most recently, Trump took credit for the index breaking above 25,000 for the first time. He also told reporters: \" I guess our new number is 30,000 .\" \nHe talks less about the S&P 500, perhaps because its name recognition isn't as strong as the Dow's, but also because it's gains are slightly less impressive. \nThe broader S&P 500 jumped 23 percent during Trump's first year in office. But the index did better during the first year of three other presidents: Roosevelt, Barack Obama and Harry Truman. \nThe S&P 500 rose 96 percent in Roosevelt's first year. It gained 33.5 percent when Truman took office and 34 percent after Obama was sworn in. \nObama took office in January 2009, less than two months before the market started to recover from the financial crisis."}

Protesters also attacked police stations elsewhere in Iran late into the night on Monday, news agency and social media reports said. \nOne member of the security forces was reported killed on Monday, bringing to at least 14 the death toll stemming from the boldest challenge to Iran\u2019s clerical leadership since unrest in 2009. \nIn his first reaction to the unrest, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: \u201cIn recent days, enemies of Iran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence apparatus to create troubles for the Islamic Republic.\u201d \nKhamenei said on his website that he would address the nation about the recent events \u201cwhen the time is right\u201d. \nHe did not mention any enemies by name but Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, said the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia were behind the recent riots in Iran. \n\u201cSaudis will receive Iran\u2019s unexpected response and they know how serious it can be,\u201d Shamkhani was quoted as saying by Tasnim news in an interview with Beirut-based Al Mayadeen TV. \nHARSH PUNISHMENT Musa Ghazanfarabadi, head of Tehran\u2019s Revolutionary Court, warned protesters on Tuesday that those arrested would face harsh punishment. \nThe semi-official ILNA news agency quoted Ali Asghar Naserbakht, the deputy governor of Tehran province, as saying that 200 people were arrested on Saturday in Tehran, 150 people on Sunday and about 100 people on Monday. \nHundreds of others have been arrested in other cities, according to agency reports and social media. \nNaserbakht said the situation in Tehran was under control and police has not asked for the help of the Revolutionary Guards special forces. \nDeputy Interior Minister Hossein Zolfaghari said 90 percent of the detainees were under 25-years-old, showing frustration among youths from the economic situation and lack of social freedoms. \nMehr news agency quoted a judiciary official as saying that several ringleaders of protests in Karaj, the fourth largest city in Iran, have been arrested. \nGhazanfarabadi said the detainees will be soon put on trial and the ringleaders would face serious charges including \u201cmoharebeh\u201d -- an Islamic term meaning warring against God -- which carries the death penalty. \nIran\u2019s judiciary chief Sadeq Larijani ordered prosecutors on Monday to \u201cpunish rioters firmly\u201d. \nThe demonstrations which broke out last week were initially focused on economic hardships and alleged corruption but turned into political rallies. \nAnger was soon directed at the clerical leadership that has been in power since the 1979 revolution, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the ultimate authority in Iran\u2019s system of dual clerical and republican rule. \nPeople protest in Tehran, Iran December 30, 2017 in this picture obtained from social media.

Since I started with sport, the Olympics has been the big one,\u201d Samuelsson said. \n\u201cI\u2019ve watched it on TV, it\u2019s the big highlight for every athlete, and to experience that would be incredible.\u201d \nSamuelsson started out as a cross-country skier before his head was turned while watching a biathlon competition in his home town of Solleftea, and soon after he was learning how to shoot with an air rifle. \n\u201cIt\u2019s very technical, especially in the prone position as you have to lie in the same way every time to make sure the shots go to the same place,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt gets harder and harder the more pressure is on - all of a sudden if you\u2019re shooting for a medal in the Olympics or a good place in the World Cup, it\u2019s easy for your thoughts to run away and to get nervous. That makes it a lot harder,\u201d he said. \nSamuelsson is well aware of his relative lack of comparative experience, and said he hopes to learn from the Olympics. \n\u201dIn some way, you want your best result for the season to be at the Olympics, to have a little better form, shoot well - it\u2019s more about precision, to arrive there and have a good race and shoot well. \n\u201cThen whatever place you get, that\u2019s hard to say, but top 10 in the Olympics would be a dream. Top-20 would be good too, I\u2018m still a junior, I\u2019ll be at the Olympics to see and learn.\u201d \nSamuelsson and his team mates know that competition will be stiff in South Korea. \n\u201cThe IBU has invested in broadening the sport, even in smaller nations,\u201d he said. \n\u201dIn cross-country skiing, there are very few nations who have a chance, but in the men\u2019s class in biathlon, there\u2019s probably 30 athletes who could win a medal if they have a good day. \n\u201cThen you have the likes of Martin Fourcade of France, clearly those guys are a step ahead in some ways, so you can\u2019t make a mistake with the shooting.\u201d \nSamuelsson may be going to the Olympics to learn, but he believes that he and his fellow Swedes have a good shot at a medal. \n\u201cIn particular in the relay, I think Sweden have a really good chance,\u201d he said.

Scanpix Denmark\/Liselotte Sabroe via REUTERS Novo went public with the offer on Monday after Ablynx rebuffed earlier approaches and analysts predicted the Danish group, whose new chief executive is seeking new products to bolster growth, would need to raise its bid to win and might face counterbidders.\nThe approach comes at a time of renewed interest by large drugmakers in acquiring smaller biotech companies to boost their product portfolios.\nU.S.-based Celgene ( CELG.O ) clinched a deal to acquire Impact Biomedicines for up to $7 billion on Sunday, while Japan\u2019s Takeda Pharmaceutical ( 4502.T ) agreed last week to buy another Belgian biotech group TiGenix ( G9U.BR ) for $630 million.\nNovo has offered up to 30.50 euros per share for Ablynx, a 60 per cent premium to its Dec. 6 share price, before its first approach.\nAblynx specialises in the research of novel drugs based on nano-bodies found in the immune systems of llamas and alpacas, for which it partners with several of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies.\nThe main attraction for Novo is Ablynx\u2019s experimental drug caplacizumab for the rare bleeding disorder acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which would complement Novo\u2019s line-up of blood products focused on haemophilia.\nThe $11 billion haemophilia market is facing upheaval and Novo stands to lose sales following approval of a new Roche ( ROG.S ) drug Hemlibra.\nHaematology has become an increasingly important for Novo, but is still small in comparison to its key diabetes business.\nNEW NOVO CEO ACTS The Danish company said it would pay 28.00 euros per share in cash for Ablynx and an additional 2.50 euros in a so-called contingent value right (CVR) if certain conditions related to its research portfolio were met.\nAn acquisition would be the first by Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who took over a year ago. He has said the firm needs external innovation to broaden its product line-up.\nUnder previous chief executive Lars Rebien Sorensen, Novo sat out a spate of deal-making across the drugs industry in recent years and instead focused on its market-leading position making insulin and other diabetes treatments.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Danish multinational pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is pictured on the facade of a production plant in Chartres, north-central France, April 21, 2016.

Belgium\u2019s market regulator on Monday suspended Ablynx\u2019s shares until further notice.\nAnalysts at Jefferies said they had a fair value of Ablynx at 29 euros per share, rising to 36 euros under a long term upside scenario.\n\u201cWe envisage Novo needing to hike the offer and could see counterbids,\u201d the analysts said, adding that they see the latest offer as \u201ca low-ball bid\u201d.\nTax breaks and other incentives have created a thriving biotech industry in Belgium, with many companies spun off from university projects now listed on the local stock exchange.\nAblynx\u2019s shares have almost doubled in price in the past 12 months, buoyed by successful clinical trial data. They closed at 21.20 euros on Friday.\nIts products, which are all still undergoing medical trials, target many different diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis or cancer.\n($1 = 0.8322 euros)\nAdditional reporting by Stine Jacobsen in Copenhagen, Ben Hirschler in London and Abinaya Vijayaraghavan in Bengaluru; Editing by Edmund Blair and Keith Weir\n "}

REUTERS\/Ibraheem Al Omari \nSince Marat Safin won the Australian Open in 2005 no Russian man has reached a grand slam final and only Nikolay Davydenko and still active Mikhail Youzhny have come close. \nIt has been a different story in the women\u2019s game during that period with Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova winning slams and Vera Zvonareva and Safin\u2019s sister, former world number one, Dinara Safina reaching finals. \nWomen\u2019s bragging rights might be coming to an end though. \nIn young firebrands Andrey Rublev, Karen Khachanov and Daniil Medvedev, Russia has a fearless trio of players all aged 21 or under who are determined to set the record straight. \nThey all played at the ATP\u2019s NextGen Finals in Milan in November where Rublev reached the final. \nLast week the 20-year-old began his season in style to reach the Qatar Open final which pushed him to a career-high 32 in the rankings and a seeded position at next week\u2019s Australian Open. \nKhachanov is not far behind at 48 while the mercurial Medvedev, who stunned three-times grand slam champion Stan Wawrinka at Wimbledon last year, has been slightly later developing and is ranked at 84. \nThe pugnacious Rublev, coached by Fernando Vicente, looks the best bet for a strong run in Melbourne where last year he was taught a lesson by Britain\u2019s then world number one Andy Murray, gathering only five games. \nHis game has caught fire since and former world number one Mats Wilander is watching his progress with interest. \n\u201cI think he is going to have a breakthrough in terms of rankings because mentally he is there, he is consistent, even though the way he plays is kind of inconsistent because he hits the ball so damn hard,\u201d Wilander, who will present his daily Game, Set and Mats feature for Eurosport in Melbourne, told Reuters in an interview. \n\u201cHe fights so hard. I don\u2019t know whether it will be top 10 or has a great slam like he did at the U.S. Open where he got to the quarter-finals. That\u2019s his mindset now, winning slams, especially when you\u2019ve reached a quarter-final.\u201d BEEF UP \nRublev admitted after losing to South Korea\u2019s Hyeon Chung in the NextGen final that he needed to beef up his physique and his work in the off-season with Vicente and Galo Blanco in Barcelona already looks to have paid dividends. \n\u201cThis time of my life, my career is the most important as I lay the foundations for a strong future,\u201d he said in Doha. \u201cIn working with Fernando and Galo in Barcelona during the off-season, we worked on problems and weaknesses.\u201d \nThe big-hitting Khachanov also trains in Barcelona and he and Rublev are firm friends, while Medvedev took a different path having taken up the sport seriously at a later age. \nMedvedev, 21, says the presence of a bunch of players of the same age is a motivating factor, as is the prospect of emulating the charismatic former world number one Safin. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a big contest for us,\u201d Medvedev, who has trained in the south of France since the age of 18, told Reuters. \n\u201dWe want to climb the rankings as a group, but at the same time each one of us wants to be the first in Russia. \n\u201cMarat was an idol of mine, especially the way he crashed the rackets, and I hope that one of us can make half of what he did in tennis.\u201d \nThe Russian revolution spreads further too, when considering that Germany\u2019s rising star Alexander Zverev, now ranked fourth in the world, has Russian parentage and Canadian 18-year-old sensation Denis Shapovalov\u2019s family also hail originally from the country, moving to Israel in the 1990s.

Citic Securities, China\u2019s largest brokerage, is one of the banks involved, added one of them.\nA spokesman for Citic Securities declined to comment.\nWanda\u2019s businesses range from real estate to football and cinemas but it has been rattled in the past year by a government-led crackdown on overseas deals and high leverage. The company is owned by Wang Jianlin, one of China\u2019s richest men.\nAn IPO of Wanda\u2019s sports assets would include Infront Sports & Media AG, a Swiss sports marketing company and World Triathlon Corp, the organizer and promoter of the Ironman race, according to three of the people.\nThe two were acquired in 2015 for $1.2 billion and $650 million respectively.\nThe share offering would also include Wanda\u2019s smaller sports assets in China, such as cycling and basketball leagues, one of them said. The public float would not involve Wanda\u2019s 20 percent stake in the Spanish football club Atletico Madrid, valued at 67 million euros after a recent capital raise, the source said.\nThe IPO would most likely take place in Hong Kong, but bankers have also pitched for a U.S. listing, according to the people.\nWanda is separately looking to sell Sunseeker International, a British yacht maker it bought in 2013 for $495 million but whose financial performance it has failed to turn around, two other people said.\nWanda declined to comment. The people could not be named as the plans are confidential.\nWanda\u2019s interest in property, sports and entertainment - accounting for more than $13 billion of its deals in the past five years - ran into official opposition last year when Beijing labeled overseas deals in those areas \u201cirrational\u201d.\nIn addition to sports, its holdings also include the cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings and movie studio Legendary Entertainment.\nThe company is also considering the merits of a pre-IPO funding round for the sports unit, according to one of the people. All plans are still at an early stage however as Wanda is seeking a chief financial officer for the sports business to lead the fundraising efforts, said another of the people.\nProperty forms the basis of the Wanda empire - its mixed use Wanda Plaza developments are common across China - but this too has put pressure on Wang\u2019s business.\nLast year, Chinese regulators told banks to stop providing funding for several of its overseas acquisitions as Beijing looks to curb the conglomerate\u2019s offshore buying spree.\nShortly after, Wanda sold a portfolio of hotels and tourism assets, including 13 theme parks, for $9 billion to Guangzhou R&F Properties ( 2777.HK ) and Sunac China ( 1918.HK ).

(NASDAQ:SELB), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on unlocking the full potential of biologic therapies by avoiding unwanted immune responses, today announced that President and CEO Werner Cautreels, Ph.D., intends to retire effective December 31, 2018. Selecta\u2019s Board of Directors plans to retain an executive search firm to identify a successor. In conjunction with this succession process, Dr. Omid Farokhzad, a member of Selecta\u2019s Board and a cofounder of the company, has been appointed Chairman of the Board effective December 31, 2017. Selecta expects Dr. Cautreels to remain a member of the Board following his retirement.\n\u201cLeading Selecta has been a privilege, and my time at the company has been extremely rewarding on both a personal and professional level,\u201d said Dr. Cautreels. \u201cSelecta remains on track to achieve significant milestones in 2018, with SEL-212 expected to enter a Phase 3 clinical trial in the second half of 2018 and SEL-403 expected to enter a clinical trial in the first quarter of 2018. We also have enhanced our team in recent months by naming John Leaman, M.D., as our Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Strategy and adding Stephen Smolinski as our Chief Commercial Officer. This is the right time to identify my successor for the next phase of Selecta\u2019s growth while also further strengthening our governance. I am grateful that Dr. Omid Farokhzad has agreed to serve as our new Chairman. Omid and I have been close partners in building Selecta. Together with the Board and management team, I look forward to helping Selecta continue its growth and progress.\u201d\nDr. Farokhzad is one of Selecta\u2019s cofounders and has served as a member of its Board of Directors since 2007, including serving as its Vice Chairman from 2008 to 2016.

Under Werner\u2019s leadership, we have built the company with a promising and diverse pipeline of proprietary product candidates as well as licensed product development opportunities. I have greatly enjoyed working with Werner over the past seven years. We are pleased that he will remain with Selecta as our President and CEO through 2018. I also am excited about the opportunity to serve Selecta as Chairman as we leverage our SVP platform to develop new treatment options for patients with chronic severe gout, cancer and other serious diseases.\u201d\nAbout Selecta Biosciences, Inc.\nSelecta Biosciences, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is focused on unlocking the full potential of biologic therapies by avoiding unwanted immune responses. Selecta plans to combine its tolerogenic Synthetic Vaccine Particles (SVP\u2122) to a range of biologics for rare and serious diseases that require new treatment options. The company\u2019s current proprietary pipeline includes SVP-enabled enzyme, oncology and gene therapies. SEL-212, the company\u2019s lead candidate in Phase 2, is being developed to treat severe gout patients and resolve their debilitating symptoms, including flares and gouty arthritis. An investigational new drug (IND) application was recently accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a combination therapy consisting of SVP-Rapamycin and LMB-100 (Selecta\u2019s SEL-403 product candidate) for the treatment of patients with malignant pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma. Selecta\u2019s two proprietary gene therapy product candidates, SEL-302 and SEL-313, are being developed for rare inborn errors of metabolism and have the potential to enable repeat administration. The use of SVP is also being explored in the development of vaccines and treatments for allergies and autoimmune diseases. Selecta is based in Watertown, Massachusetts.

INTC 0.17% is so dominant in its markets that any security flaw in its chips will have only a modest impact on the company in the short-term. The long-term is different, especially if Intel lets its credibility slip.\nThe security vulnerabilities found by a team of Google researchers affect many different systems running on different chips and software. But only Intel is paying the price so far. The chip giant\u2019s market value has slipped more than $10\u200b billion\u2014nearly \u200b5%\u2014since Tuesday\u2019s close.\nThat is largely because Intel\u2019s chips power the vast majority of personal computers and servers currently in operation. Intel has been working with a consortium of other tech giants to develop fixes since becoming aware of the issue in June. Those fixes are currently being deployed. Intel says most will see a \u201climited to negligible\u201d performance impact from the changes.\nThe company also says it doesn\u2019t anticipate a financial impact, such as a charge to earnings or a \u201cchange in acceptance of our products.\u201d But some of that is due to the simple reality that Intel controls the vast majority of the market for processors for PCs and more than 90% of those sold for servers. In data centers in particular, the big cloud service operators have pressing needs. Combined capital spending by Amazon.com , Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. for the first nine months of 2017 was up 28% year over year to $29 billion.\nIn the long-term, the impact is less clear. Intel faces strong competition as artificial intelligence shapes the future of computing. New data center designs are incorporating different types of chips made by rivals such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. Deep-pocketed customers like Google are also now designing their own processors for part of their cloud workloads. And the future is further complicated by the Chinese government, which is investing heavily in its homegrown chip industry with an aim to take global share.\nSo Intel can ill afford to give its customers an excuse to look elsewhere\u2014or to demand lower prices. And it doesn\u2019t help that CEO Brian Krzanich made his largest stock sale on record in November following a late-year surge that put Intel\u2019s stock to a 10-year high. That sale was arranged and executed after Intel learned of the vulnerabilities, though the company denies a connection.\nIntel has been a laggard in a powerful two-year chip stock rally.

In a conference call with analysts, Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) said the new tax code should be a \u201cnet positive\u201d for the industry.\nConsumer discounts aimed at moving vehicles off dealer lots will likely remain a concern for the industry. Discounts of more than 10 percent of a vehicle\u2019s sticker price can hurt resale values, in turn weighing on new vehicle sales. In December, auto consultancies J.D. Power and LMC estimated discounts had topped 10 percent for the 17th time in the last 18 months.\nGeneral Motors Co ( GM.N ) reported a 3.3 percent drop in sales in December, driven by a decline in lower-margin fleet sales to government agencies and rental car companies. The company\u2019s retail sales were up 1.8 percent in December.\nFor the full year, GM\u2019s sales fell 1.3 percent. The automaker said its average transaction price hit $35,400, above the industry average of $31,600.\nThe No. 1 U.S. automaker said it expects industry-wide U.S. new vehicle sales in 2018 \u201cin the high 16 million-unit range.\u201d\n\u201cThis year, many consumers will see their take-home pay rise because of tax reform,\u201d GM chief economist Mustafa Mohatarem said in a statement. \u201cThat will keep the broad economy growing, and help keep sales at very healthy levels even as the Fed increases interest rates.\u201d\nGM\u2019s high inventory of unsold vehicles had been a concern for observers earlier in the year. The automaker said at the end of December it had 63 days supply unsold vehicles, beating its target of around 70 days supply.\nFord reported a 0.9 percent increase in sales for December, fueled by a 17 percent increase in fleet sales.\nThe No. 2 U.S. automaker said retail sales were down 4 percent and that lucrative pickup truck sales were 1 percent lower than in December 2016.\nIn late morning trading, GM shares were up 2.2 percent, Ford shares were up 0.6 percent and Fiat Chrysler was up 1.2 percent.\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) ( FCHA.MI ) posted an 11 percent sales decrease, with retail sales dropping 3 percent.

The homes of Hong Kong\u2019s new top legal official, Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng, and her husband Otto Poon, where illegal structures including glasshouse, swimming pool and basement were discovered, are seen in Hong Kong, China January 10, 2018. REUTERS\/Bobby Yip \nHong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam has defended Cheng publicly, saying she had not covered up anything. \nThe rule of law and an independent judiciary have long been seen as key pillars in the success of the former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and enjoys a high degree of autonomy under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement. \nIn recent years, however, China has weighed into the city\u2019s legal system on a number of occasions, such as a legal interpretation that led to the disqualification of opposition lawmakers from the legislature. \nSeveral cases in which democracy activists and police officers were jailed have also provoked criticism of judges. Hundreds of lawyers held two rare protest marches in recent years to voice concerns about China\u2019s interference. \nThe Buildings Department told Reuters its inspectors were initially barred from entering Cheng\u2019s nearly $3-million villa when the scandal first broke. \nBut when allowed in on a repeat visit on Tuesday, the inspectors discovered nine unauthorized structures, including a basement, a swimming pool and a rooftop den with French windows in Cheng\u2019s house and an adjoining one owned by her husband. \nLand records reviewed by Reuters show Cheng bought the property through a company called Sparkle Star Development Limited. Her husband, Otto Poon, who lives next door, bought his house in 2012. They married in 2016. \nCheng said a rectification proposal was submitted to the Buildings Department on Wednesday, adding that neither she nor her husband, a past president of the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers, was trained to identify illegal structures. \n\u201cOne doesn\u2019t look at a thing and know whether it\u2019s illegal,\u201d said Cheng, who has been a member of government-linked housing panels and co-authored a book on construction law.

Bernstein | Reuters Secretary of Defense James Mattis \nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis stressed diplomacy as the way to deal with the North Korean crisis on Friday during talks with his South Korean counterpart in Hawaii, a day after Seoul's top diplomat said a military solution would be unacceptable. \n\"Diplomacy should (impose) reason on Kim's reckless rhetoric and dangerous provocations,\" Mattis said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . \nHe added that the response to the threat remained \"diplomacy led, backed up with military options available to ensure that our diplomats are understood to be speaking from a position of strength.\" \nThe administration of President Donald Trump has said all options are on the table when it comes to North Korea's pursuit of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the United States. \nBut Mattis has consistently stressed non-military actions, including international sanctions. He renewed that message as he met South Korean Minister of Defence Song Young-moo at the U.S. Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii. \nSong said he expected to discuss North Korea with Mattis, but noted firm coordination between the two militaries. \n\"We both understand each other well and that as an alliance, we always go together,\" he said, speaking through a translator. \nThe exchange came a day after South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program must be resolved diplomatically, and added that she was certain Washington would consult her government first if a military option were to be considered. \nShe declined to comment if Washington had given Seoul clear assurance but added: \"This is our fate that is at stake. Any option that is to be taken on the Korean Peninsula, cannot be implemented without us going along.\" \nAfter their first formal talks in more than two years this month, officials from the two Koreas have been visiting each other to facilitate the North's participation in the Olympics, to be held in the South's alpine resort town of Pyeongchang. \nNorth Korea has waged a publicity campaign around its attendance, calling on Thursday for \"all Koreans at home and abroad\" to promote inter-Korean cooperation. \nKim's regime has also set a new anniversary to mark the formation of its military on Feb. 8 \u2014 the day before the start of the Games. Analysts say the nation may observe the day with a large military parade. \nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who will represent the United States at the Olympics, said on Tuesday he would seek to counter what he described as an effort by North Korea to \"hijack\" the Games with a propaganda campaign."}

Depletions, or distributor shipments to retail customers, rose 9.1 percent due to the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays in the quarter. \nNet income rose to $491.1 million, or $2.44 per share, in the third quarter ended Nov. 30, from $405.9 million, or $1.98 per share, a year earlier. \nExcluding one-time items the company earned $2.00 per share, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.89 per share. \nNet sales fell marginally to $1.80 billion from $1.81 billion but missed analysts' estimates of $1.87 billion.

Based on its data, sports apparel and equipment company Nike was a safe bet: A $1,000 investment in Nike in 2007 would be worth $3,319 as of October 31, or more than three times the initial investment.\nOf the companies How Much examined, Nike's performance ranked fifth, falling short only of Starbucks , Apple , Amazon and Netflix . It should be said, though, that Netflix outperformed the other companies by a lot: A $1,000 investment in 2007 grew to $51,966 in the same time frame.\nIn the graphic below, the blue dots are equivalent to a $1,000 initial investment, and the pink dots equal the investment's current total value.\n\"The larger the pink circle, the more your investment is worth,\" according to How Much. \"If the pink fits inside the blue, then you lost money. The [graphic] assumes that you took any dividend paid out in cash and did not reinvest into the company by buying more stock.\"\nAny individual stock can over- or under-perform and past returns do not predict future results.\nSome investors also have concerns about Nike. Susan Anderson of capital-market company B. Riley FBR says in a recent episode of \" Squawk on the Street \" that that's because the athletic-apparel and footwear environments in the future will look a lot different than they have in the past.\nAnd while the athletic apparel environments \"have been very robust over the past 5 to 10 years,\" Anderson says she doesn't anticipate the same type of growth going forward, or at least not initially. \nMany companies, including Nike, are attempting to take product distribution directly to their consumers since, according to Nike chief executive officer Mark Parker, retail consolidation has decelerated the overall market.\nRandal Konik of investment-banking company Jefferies Group tells \"Squawk on the Street\" that for Nike, as a mostly \"wholesale-oriented business model, it's going to take time and it's going to take a lot of choppiness in terms of [its distribution] fundamentals.\"\nAs a sponsor to a number of high-profile sports teams, including those in the NFL and NBA , and with sneaker collaborations with top athletes like LeBron James , though, others see potential for the stock's continued growth.\nIf you're just considering getting into stocks , experts advise beginning carefully.

The exclusion of data from South Korean exchanges, where virtual currencies trade at a wide premium, sowed confusion and triggered a broad selloff. \n\u201dEvery crypto is priced at a 30 percent premium in South Korea,\u201c said Greg Dwyer, head of business development at cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMex. \u201dBy removing that, it looks like the market cap fell by 30 percent and so people rushed to sell because they\u2019re not sure what\u2019s happening. \nAs of midday in New York, bitcoin was last down 7.1 percent, at $14,980 BTC=BTSP on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. It fell to a one-week low below $14,000. \nAnalysts said bitcoin was also undermined by news earlier in the session that South Korean financial authorities were inspecting six local banks that offer virtual currency accounts to institutions. \nMarket participants said CoinMarketCap removed data without any explanation from three of the largest South Korean exchanges: Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit. \nCoinMarketCap was not immediately available to comment on its move. \nCryptocurrency prices tend to be much higher on South Korean exchanges because of huge demand and monetary restrictions in that country, analysts said. \n\u201cSouth Korea has always had a premium because it\u2019s very difficult to get cash out of the country,\u201d said Dwyer. \u201cAnyone looking to take advantage of an arbitrage in South Korea needs to do it with fiat currencies.\u201d \nRipple\u2019s currency XRP fell more than 30 percent on the day, after hitting an all-time peak of around $3.84.

Spot gold values gained more than 13 percent last year, their best annual performance since 2010. \n\u201cJewellers were replenishing inventory in the first half of 2017 after demonetization in the last quarter of 2016,\u201d Sudheesh Nambiath, a senior analyst with GFMS, a division of Thomson Reuters, said on Tuesday. \nIn November 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi scrapped 500- and 1,000-rupee banknotes, which accounted for 86 percent of the value of cash in circulation, part of a crackdown on corruption, tax evasion and the financing of militant groups. \nThe move created a cash crunch and dampened gold purchases in the last quarter of 2016. As cash became available over 2017, jewellers and dealers started restocking bullion. \nGood monsoon rains in 2017 also helped to revive farmers income and retail demand in rural areas, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bank. \nRural demand takes up two-thirds of India\u2019s total. \nIn mid-December, global gold prices fell to their lowest level in five months in anticipation of a hike in interest rates from the U.S. Federal Reserve. \n\u201cThe price correction encouraged trading houses and banks to increase imports last month,\u201d said a Mumbai-based bullion dealer with a private bank. \nThe country\u2019s overseas gold purchases in December stood at 70 tonnes, up 40 percent from a year ago, GFMS data showed. \nIndia\u2019s gold imports this month could be higher than last January\u2019s 50 tonnes, but lower than the December imports as demand has been softening due to the recent price rise, said the dealer in Mumbai. \nSpot gold rose 0.6 percent to $1,310.48 an ounce at 1029 GMT, having hit its highest since Sept. 26 at $1,312.34 earlier in the session.

File Photo - Drivers queue on a main road in central London November 4, 2010. REUTERS\/Toby Melville \nDemand for new diesel cars plunged 17.1 percent, and with some buyers switching to petrol motors, average CO2 emissions for new cars rose for the first time in two decades, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. \nTotal registrations ended 2017 at 2.54 million, with drops among both business and private consumers, and are set to fall up to 7 percent this year, the SMMT forecast. \nBritain said last year it would hike the levy on new diesel cars that do not meet the latest emissions standards after months of uncertainty over a potential diesel scrappage scheme and confusion over government plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles from 2040. \nSince the 2015 Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) emissions cheating scandal, some major cities including Madrid, Paris and Athens have announced plans particularly focused on cutting diesel emissions including bans, fines and restrictions. \nOnce touted as a cleaner alternative to petrol, which emits more CO2, diesel has come under fire for releasing other toxic fumes. \nCar sales in Britain have previously been a leading indicator for the performance of the economy and last year\u2019s drop is the biggest since demand nosedived in 2009 after the financial crisis, but comes after record highs in 2015 and 2016. \nSales in December fell 14.4 percent and SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said further drops were likely in the coming months.

They previously have declined to make any statements about the case outside of court. \nDear was charged with multiple counts of murder and dozens of additional crimes stemming from the rampage at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs in November 2015. \nThe shooting left three dead, including a police officer from a nearby college who responded to the scene. Dear surrendered after a three-hour standoff with police. \nIn earlier courtroom outbursts, Dear said he was guilty and proclaimed himself \u201ca warrior for the babies,\u201d prompting Judge Gilbert Martinez, of Colorado\u2019s El Paso County Court, to order a mental evaluation. \nTwo state-appointed psychologists testified that Dear, a South Carolina native, suffers from a psychotic delusional disorder. \nMartinez deemed Dear incompetent to stand trial. He has been held at the state mental hospital in Pueblo, where he has refused medications, court documents showed. \nProsecutors sought court permission to forcibly medicate Dear with Zyprexa, Abilify, Haldol and Cogentin, according to court papers. \nDefense lawyers argued that the state failed to meet the legal requirements needed to involuntarily medicate Dear. \nAfter a closed hearing, Judge Jill Mattoon, of Pueblo District Court, ruled that the state had the right to forcibly medicate Dear in an attempt to bring him to trial. \nDear\u2019s lawyers appealed her ruling, setting the stage for Thursday\u2019s opinion by a three-judge appellate panel. \nThe appeals court in its ruling noted that a U.S. Supreme Court decision allows the state \u201cto render a criminal defendant competent to stand trial\u201d if certain criteria are met. \n\u201cBecause the (Supreme Court) test was met, we further conclude that the forced administration of antipsychotic medications to Dear is not an unconstitutional deprivation of his liberty,\u201d the judges ruled in their unanimous decision. \nUnder Colorado\u2019s criminal insanity statute, a defendant found unfit to stand trial must have the competency determination reviewed every 90 days.

Dianne Feinstein released Simpson's testimony from a closed-door interview session with the Senate Judiciary Committee . That move drew harsh condemnation from Trump, who referred to Feinstein as \"Sneaky Dianne.\"\nGetty Images Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Appleton, Wisconsin on March 30th, 2016. The release of the House panel testimony couldn't come at a more dramatic time for Trump, either, as the president marks his first full year in office and the government barrels toward a shutdown this weekend. Trump is also a central figure in a probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential ties between Trump's campaign and the Kremlin.\nBoth transcripts also hit the news in the middle of the furor over Michael Wolff's tell-all book, \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\" which cited former chief Trump strategist Steve Bannon disparaging the president's son Donald Trump Jr., daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\nTrump has denied collusion with Russia and has extensively criticized Wolff's book and Bannon \u2014 the latter of whom has reached an agreement to talk to Mueller .\nSimpson's testimony to the House Intelligence Committee is fueling already heated speculation about whether Trump is somehow indebted to Russian business and government figures. The president, for his part, has repeatedly called allegations of improper ties to Russia a \"hoax\" and often dismissed the dossier.\nPablo Martinez Monsivais | AP Glenn R. Simpson, co-founder of the research firm Fusion GPS, arrives for a scheduled appearance before a closed House Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 14, 2017. Here are some of the highlights of Simpson's testimony in November:\nSimpson said it was hard to track down \"reliable information\" about Trump's financial situation, but he said he thinks Trump's wealthy father, Fred, set him up rather nicely. \"I also think that, you know, a lot of his income comes from trusts and things that his father set up, and that he doesn't actually make that much money, you know, in terms of profits from his own activities,\" Simpson said. \"He still funds much of his \u2014 from, you know, assets that were acquired by his father.\" Trump, Simpson said, used to be mixed up with Italian mobsters before he became entangled with Russian organized crime types. \"We also had sort of more broadly learned that Mr. Trump had long time associations with Italian organized crime figures,\" Simpson testified. \"And as we pieced together the early years of his biography, it seemed as if during the early part of his career he had connections to a lot of Italian mafia figures, and then gradually during the '90s became associated with Russian mafia figures.\" Many Trump businesses were not that profitable, according to Simpson, but the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Russia turned a profit for the mogul. But, Simpson added, \"I don't think we have a full accounting you know, how much he got paid and where the money came from for putting that on in Russia.\" Trump properties in various locations around the globe received Russian money, Simpson said. \"Ultimately, you know, what we came to realize was that the money was actually coming out of Russia and going into his properties in Florida and New York and Panama and Toronto and these other places.\" The Fusion GPS co-founder told the committee that he was told, although he couldn't confirm, that Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit movement in the U.K. and a Trump supporter, had made trips to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to give data to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. \"What kind of data?\" asked ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff. \"A thumb drive,\" Simpson replied. Assange, for his part, has denied that he worked on Russia's behalf during the campaign, and Farage's Leave.EU group, likewise, has laughed off suggestions that Russia influenced the 2016 Brexit vote and the U.S. presidential campaign. Simpson also referred to purported ties between the National Rifle Association and Russian bankers and organized crime leaders. \"It appears the Russians, you know, infiltrated the NRA,\" the Fusion GPS co-founder testified. \"And there is more than one explanation for why. But I would say broadly speaking, it appears that the Russian operation was designed to infiltrate conservative organizations. And they targeted various conservative organizations, religious and otherwise, and they seem to have made a very concerted effort to get in with the NRA.\" On Thursday, McClatchy reported that the FBI was investigating Russian donations to the NRA , which was one of Trump's biggest supporters during the 2016 election.

She would look to utilities and the utilities-tracking XLU ETF specifically, because the sector's underperformance has been quite pronounced, to the point of an oversold condition.\nAnother safety play Stockton recommends is the gold miners.\n\"Gold from a long-term perspective has been sort of sleepy, but recently has picked up momentum,\" she said, pointing to a chart of the VanEck Vectors gold miners ETF, the GDX .\n\n\"If we did see a breakout in gold prices with more defensive positioning, it does tend to be looked at as a safe haven at times,\" Stockton said.\nThe XLU was modestly higher Wednesday, while the GDX was barely positive.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.

{"published":"2018-01-04T18:56:00.000+02:00","title":"Trump administration rule would let more people drop Obamacare","text":"WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The Trump administration proposed a rule on Thursday to allow Americans who are self-employed or work for small businesses to buy health insurance that does not comply with all Obamacare requirements in an effort to unwind the 2010 healthcare law.\nThe rule, put forward by the Department of Labor, would allow individuals and small businesses to form an association based on geography or industry and purchase health insurance that would be exempt from some rules of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe rule also allows sole proprietors to join such associations. Currently, sole proprietors can purchase individual insurance through the Obamacare individual market, created under former Democratic President Barack Obama's healthcare law.\nThe rule must go through a comment period but is likely to gain approval, helping to enact a similar executive order Trump signed in October.\nUnder Obamacare, all health insurance plans must cover a set of 10 essential health benefits, such as maternity and newborn care, addiction and mental health treatment and prescription drugs. The proposed rule would allow small business associations to purchase health plans that do not necessarily cover all of these benefits, which proponents say would help lower premiums.\nThe rule does not allow Small Business Health Plans to charge those with pre-existing conditions more or exclude employees because of their health.\nProponents of Obamacare say the rule would undermine the individual insurance market created under the law by allowing young and healthy people to purchase cheaper insurance, leaving the sickest and most expensive patients in the Obamacare markets, driving up costs. Hospitals, insurers and medical groups criticized the rule in December and said it would make health insurance unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions.\nRepublicans, who have unified control of government, have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, a top 2016 presidential campaign promise of U.S. President Donald Trump. Instead, the administration has sought to dismantle the law through administrative rules and executive orders.\nRepublicans dealt their biggest blow to the healthcare program in their tax overhaul that Trump signed into law last month. The law in 2019 repeals the individual mandate, the requirement that most Americans purchase health insurance or else pay a fine. Health policy experts say the mandate helps ensure a viable market.\nSeveral business groups, including the National Restaurant Association and the National Retail Federation, on Thursday praised the proposed rule, saying it would enable millions of people to obtain more affordable health insurance.

Dr. Lammers brings more than 27 years of experience in product and clinical development spanning the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.\n\u201cPaul is an experienced biopharmaceutical leader who has focused his career on trying to make a positive change in patients\u2019 lives through the development of innovative drug therapies,\u201d said Brian Bloom, CEO of Bloom Burton & Co, and Chairman and Co-Founder of Triumvira. \u201cHis experience in raising significant capital from leading strategic and traditional venture capitalists, as well as in building strong development and management teams, are invaluable assets to capture the opportunities that lie ahead for Triumvira.\u201d\n\u201cAfter facing initial challenges in clinical testing, different T-cell therapy approaches have garnered a lot of interest in the past few years with striking results obtained in the treatment of several blood-borne cancers,\u201d said Dr. Lammers. \u201cTriumvira\u2019s T-Cell Antigen Coupler (\u201cTAC\u201d) technology might represent the next step in T-cell therapy, and I am excited about developing additional promising therapies out of this platform, not only for blood-borne but also for solid tumors, and potentially also for other therapeutic areas.\u201d\nDr. Lammers joins Triumvira from Mirna Therapeutics, where he served as Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer from 2009 until its successful reverse merger with a private company in August 2017. During his tenure at Mirna Therapeutics, Dr. Lammers raised approx. $160 million in funding, both from Federal and State grants (including CPRIT, the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute from Texas), leading traditional and strategic venture firms, and by bringing the company public on the NASDAQ exchange.

In multiple liquid and solid tumor animal models, TAC-T cells outperform CAR-T cells, with markedly improved pharmacodynamic effects and reduced toxicity. The company aims to enter the clinic a year from now, and is focusing its pipeline expansion on solid tumor targets.

(Photo: Getty Images) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Whether you've used bitcoin as an investment or as a currency, you owe taxes on it. As far as Uncle Sam is concerned, bitcoin is not currency. It's property. That means whenever you buy something with bitcoin, it's two transactions, not one. What you're actually doing is selling a property (bitcoin) for a cash value and then using money from that sale to buy a product. So every single purchase you make with bitcoin has to be reported on your taxes. For many, though, bitcoin is just an investment. If you've held those bitcoins for less than a year and sell them, that cash will be taxed as income. If you've held for more than a year, it's taxed as a capital gain \u2014 which could run 20%. Adding on transaction and accounting fees could raise costs to 60%, as was the case for one early bitcoin adopter. But here's the problem: Almost no one reports this. More: Cryptocurrency markets: Bitcoin tumbles below $10,000 and is now down 25% on the year From 2013 to 2015, fewer than 900 people each year reported bitcoin transactions to the IRS. That prompted the IRS in 2014 to label cyrptocurrency as property back and to recently serve a summons to Coinbase. In it, the agency called for the records of over 14,000 users who have \"bought, sold, sent or received at least $20,000 worth of bitcoin in a given year.\" A federal court narrowed the scope of the summons but ultimately ruled in favor of the IRS. The tax status of those transactions is still unknown. Moving forward though, there may be some relief. A bipartisan bill, \"The Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act,\" was presented to Congress in September. It's seeking to create a tax exemption for crypto transactions under $600. Some remain hopeful for amnesty, but it looks like Uncle Sam is still poised to get a decent cut of the bitcoin action. \u00a9 CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Spot gold was down 0.3 percent at $1,318.40 an ounce at 0655 GMT. U.S. gold futures were down 0.2 percent at $1,319.10 an ounce. Spot gold marked its highest since Sept. 15 at $1,325.86 on Thursday on a weaker dollar. It has risen over 1 percent so far this week. Weighed down by the greenback's weakness against the euro, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was poised for a loss of 0.2 percent this week, during which it probed a three-month low of 91.751 . The dollar index was last up 0.1 percent at 91.946. \"The support for the gold continues to emerge on dips,\" said MKS PAMP trader Alex Thorndike, adding that the market would be in \"wait and see mode\" ahead of the U.S. jobs data. U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, data from ADP Research Institute showed, the biggest monthly increase since March. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a gain of 190,000 jobs. Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls report is expected to show job gains of 190,000 for December, according to a Reuters survey. Softer economic data weakens the case for a U.S. rate hike, boosting gold, which is highly exposed to interest rates and returns on other assets. Rising rates lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. \"There are some new long-positions after gold crossed $1,300 and they are trying to push prices up ... We can see people buying at corrections,\" said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong. \"The dollar will be the key to gold's moves going forward ...

The footage could not be independently confirmed. \nJets also pounded Harasta, on the western edge of the enclave, where rebels this week besieged and overran a major military base which residents say the army uses to pound residential areas. \nThe rebel assault aimed partly to relieve the pressure of the tightening siege. \nThe United Nations says about 400,000 civilians besieged in the area face \u201ccomplete catastrophe\u201d because aid deliveries by the government are blocked and hundreds of people who need urgent medical evacuation have not been allowed outside the enclave. \nScores of hospitals and civil defence centres in Ghouta and across Syria have been bombed during the conflict in what the opposition said is a \u201cscorched earth policy\u201d to paralyse life in rebel-held areas. \nSyrian state news agency SANA said on Thursday rebel shelling of the government-held capital Damascus killed one and injured 22 in the Amara district of the city. IDLIB PUSH \nSupported by Iran-backed militias and intensive Russian bombing, the Syrian army has since last month waged a new campaign to push into the heart of another rebel-held part of Syria, Idlib province in the country\u2019s northwest. \nIdlib is a heavily populated area where over two million people live. \nRescue workers said there had been a spike in civilian casualties there in the last twenty days from stepped-up aerial strikes on residential areas, documenting 50 dead at least in that period. \n\u201cThere have been at least six major massacres perpetrated by Russia in indiscriminate bombing of cities and towns with thousands fleeing their homes in the last two weeks,\u201d said Mustafa al Haj Yousef, the head of Idlib\u2019s Civil Defence, rescuers who work in opposition-held areas. \nOn Wednesday air strikes hit a maternity hospital in Idlib\u2019s Ma\u2018arat al-Nu\u2018man city, killing five people, the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) charity, which supports the hospital, said. \nThe hospital, which SAMS said delivers around 30 babies a day, had been struck three times in four days and the last strikes temporarily put the hospital out of service. \nOvernight, a family of seven was buried under rubble in Tel Dukan village, rescuers said. \nThe army has been gaining ground in Idlib and the adjoining eastern Hama countryside, with scores of villages seized from rebels mainly belonging to Tahrir al Sham, a coalition of jihadist groups with mainstream Free Syrian Army (FSA) factions also engaged in the battles.

And the ANC meeting only ends on Friday so there will be more headlines and that means rand volatility should continue,\u201d said trader at RMB Jim Bryson. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to call, it needs to close above 12.52 to get out of these ranges, but a test of around 12.20 cannot be totally discounted,\u201d Bryson said. \nThe rand has rallied since mid-December, supported by investors\u2019 hopes that the newly elected leader ANC head Cyril Ramaphosa would push through business-friendly policies. \nThe rally has since stalled, with signs of higher rates in the United States shifting some of the focus back to fundamentals, although analysts said a decision on Zuma remained the main swing factor. \n\u201cHe (Ramaphosa) is likely to do everything in his power to reduce Zuma\u2019s influence and to facilitate a rapid end to his time in power. That is rand positive,\u201d said analyst at Frankfurt-based Commerzbank Elisabeth Andreae. \nBonds tracked the weaker currency, with yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026 up 7 basis points to 8.655 percent. \nIn equities, the benchmark Top-40 index slipped 0.03 percent to 53,168 points while the All-Share index declined 0.22 percent to 59,980 points. \nThe banking sector lowered 1.03 percent while general retails fell 1.55 percent on lower investors appetite for emerging markets. \n\u201cInternational invertors are lowering their exposure to emerging markets,\u201d said Cratos Capital equities trader Greg Davies. \nNedbank fell 2.32 percent to 254.20 rand, FirstRand lowered 0.62 percent to 63.00 rand and Barclays Africa weakened 0.99 percent to 174.46 rand. \nFurther losses were curbed by the local bullion sector which lifted 2.05 percent on the back of a jump in gold prices to its highest level in nearly four months. \nAngloGold Ashanti rose 3.62 percent to 133.50 rand and Gold Fields lifted 0.87 percent to 52.45 rand.

Its agenda so far is a check-list of lofty goals made for the #MeToo moment: legal defense of sexual misconduct victims, new legislation to penalize companies with persistent harassment problems, a push for gender parity at Hollywood studios and talent agencies, and a show of solidarity\u2014by way of black dresses\u2014at the Golden Globes. \nBut arguably its most revolutionary aspect is its most basic: who it will serve. The initiative\u2019s efforts are not reserved for the privileged few. \nWomen in Hollywood, relying on their public platform, are using the project to advocate for their own rights as well as for those of women in lower-profile lines of work, in part, by financially supporting their legal battles. \n\u201cFrom movie sets to farm fields to boardrooms alike, we envision nationwide leadership that reflects the world in which we live,\u201d Time\u2019s Up\u2019s website says . It helps answer some of the criticism that the #MeToo movement has focused too narrowly on women whose alleged abusers are powerful men, while overlooking the victims of the un-famous. \n\u201cIf this group of women can\u2019t fight for a model for other women who don\u2019t have as much power and privilege, then who can?\u201d Rhimes told The New York Times . \nTime\u2019s Up\u2019s leaderless, all-encompassing approach suits the sweeping, industry-agnostic nature of the sexual harassment epidemic. Yet it\u2019s unique since it comes at a time when initiatives aimed at bettering the working lives of women have not only lacked universality, but have effectively siloed women into two classes, haves and have-nots . \nThe most glaring example came in 2015, when Netflix introduced a shiny, new parental leave policy that gave new parents up to a year off. The policy\u2014while generous by any measure\u2014only applied to salaried employees in Netflix\u2019s streaming business , creating tiers of employees at the company as it exempted hundreds of workers in other divisions. \nNetflix later upgraded the benefits of those left out of the initial parental leave policy , but not enough to match the perks enjoyed by salaried streaming employees. \nEver since Netflix was skewered for its original approach, some companies have been explicit in applying new benefits packages to all workers, regardless of their employment status. \nIn January 2016, Hilton introduced a new paid leave policy that applied to its hourly staff. Later in the year, yogurt company Chobani said it would offer a new paid family leave program to its 2,000 workers, including those on the factory floor. And in December 2016, Ikea rolled out a new program that treated salaried and hourly employees identically . \nEven with companies introducing their own policies more equitably, the benefits apply\u2014of course\u2014only to employees of such firms; the haves in this scenario, with everyone else becoming have-nots . That\u2019s one of many downsides of the United States\u2019 system of handling of such benefits at the employer level, rather than at the federal level, like all other industrialized economies. \nBut even outside the corporate sphere, there\u2019s been criticism that pro-women efforts\u2014especially those in the Trump era\u2014have carved out classes.

Trump says he wants any immigration deal to include funding for a border wall with Mexico and a tightening of immigration restrictions.\n\"We are going to build the wall,\" Trump said in a speech on Monday in Nashville, Tennessee.\nDemocrats want a deal to help the estimated 700,000 young \"Dreamer\" immigrants, whose protection from potential deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program ends in early March.\nBut, under pressure from immigrant groups, they are reluctant to give ground to Trump on the issue of the wall \u2014 his central promise from the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\"There have been some discussions but our position is clear and their position is somewhat clear. We want to drill down and see if there is some room for negotiations,\" a White House official said.\nTop congressional leaders are not expected to attend Tuesday's meeting. Instead, the guest list is set to include lawmakers from both parties involved in the immigration debate, such as Republican Senators John Cornyn of Texas and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, and Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, a Democrat.\nNancy Pelosi , head of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, indicated she did not expect much progress from the meeting.\n\"I would have more faith in the meeting if they would have people going who really knew the issue from our side,\" she said, adding that she was not criticizing Durbin.\nMany of the Dreamers are from Mexico and Central America and have spent most of their lives in the United States, attending school and participating in society.\nTrump put their fate in doubt in early September when he announced he was ending former President Barack Obama's DACA program, which allowed them to legally live and work in the United States temporarily.\nTrump, under pressure from some conservatives, has said any DACA deal with Democrats must include ending \"chain migration,\" which could jeopardize the parents of Dreamers who are still in the United States illegally and a visa lottery program.\nSome House Republicans want to use Dreamer legislation to add more funds for immigration enforcement, which advocacy groups fear would be used to go after the relatives of the young immigrants.\nU.S. Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a Republican, said that the session on Tuesday would not simply consist of lawmakers presenting Trump with a plan for him to reject or accept.\n\"It's less us coming up with something and getting a yes or no from the president, but having the administration actively engaged in it,\" Tillis told Reuters, adding, \"and the president is.\""}

Slideshow (9 Images) \nWith Volkswagen, Nvidia said it was infusing its artificial intelligence technology into the German automakers\u2019 future lineup, using their new Drive IX platform. The technology will enable so-called \u201cintelligent co-pilot\u201d capabilities based on processing sensor data inside and outside the car. \nSo far, 320 companies involved in self-driving cars - whether software developers, automakers and their suppliers, sensor and mapping companies - are using Nvidia Drive, formerly branded as the Drive PX2, the company said. \nHuang said Baidu and German auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG [ZFF.UL] had selected Nvidia Drive for their AV computing platform development in China. \nNvidia added that its first Xavier processors would be delivered to customers this quarter. The system on a chip delivers 30 trillion operations per second using 30 watts of power. \nNvidia will collaborate with Silicon Valley startup Aurora - co-founded by the former head of Google\u2019s autonomous program, Chris Urmson - to build a new self-driving hardware platform using the Xavier processor, Huang said. \nBets that Nvidia will become a leader in chips for driverless cars, data centers and artificial intelligence have more than doubled its stock price in the past 12 months, making the Silicon Valley company the third-strongest perfomer in the S&P 500 during that time.

{"published":"2018-01-06T01:45:00.000+02:00","title":"Commentary: There\u2019s a better way to unite Europe","text":"The European political year, grinding back into gear for 2018, is full of doubt, even woe. In the continent\u2019s major countries politics are stuck, or likely to stick, in cul-de-sacs from which exit is difficult. Only in France, under the banner not so much of the tricolor as the injunction En Marche! (Let\u2019s Go!), is there official optimism and vigor.\nGermany, Europe\u2019s leading economy, has yet to agree on a government. Talks between the governing Christian Democrats and the opposition Social Democrats on the formation of a third coalition are due to start on Jan. 7. A coalition agreement may take a long time \u2013 and even if successful, the marriage will be even more loveless, and thus more fragile, than the two preceding.\nYet Germany remains strong in its economy and forecasts are bullish for this year , its businesses apparently insouciant about the politicians\u2019 dilemmas. By contrast, Italy\u2019s growth, up a little from the stagnation of recent years, remains highly dependent on a coherent government emerging from elections on March 4. The outcome, however, is forecast to end in a hung parliament , as a weakened governing Democratic Party faces a rejuvenated right and a populist Five Star Movement, presently the most popular single party.\nIn Spain, expected economic growth has been reduced from 2.6 percent to 2.3 percent on fears of continued turbulence between the Madrid government and the separatists in Catalonia, where pro-independence parties are in the majority. Poland, with its population of 38.5 million, is locked in moral and mortal combat with the European Union. And the United Kingdom is, of course, leaving the group.\nStill, hope must spring eternal in an EU which works under the rubric of \u201cever-closer Union,\u201d and that hope focuses itself on the youthful 40-year-old shoulders of Emmanuel Macron, whose \u201cEn Marche\u201d party slogan is the daily wake-up call to a France he believes had gone prematurely old, cold and weary. His plans for the Union are bold and aimed at relatively rapid integration of the economy, but also designed to be protective of European citizens, a bulwark against the chill winds of globalization. It will be a trick hard to pull off, but at least an injection of optimism into a torpid continent.\nThe plans have strong supporters in other countries \u2013 Germany\u2019s Social Democrats are led by the former president of the EU\u2019s parliament, Martin Schulz, passionate for \u201cmore Europe,\u201d and in Italy, a new political grouping is actually called More Europe (Piu Europa), led by the veteran radical and former foreign minister, Emma Bonino. Like Macron, they want a United States of Europe; unlike him, they are in a minority.\nBrave as Macron\u2019s plans may be, they lack the central, necessary element which would give them a chance of success against already-heavy odds. They frame the advantages of closer integration in terms of a more efficient economy and a necessary underpinning of the euro currency. Many economists believe the euro is too fragile to survive ongoing shocks unless it has a kind of state backing similar to that provided by national central banks. Since the EU is at best a state-in-embryo, its currency\u2019s fragility remains.\nThat makes sense to bankers and economists. But much of what comes out of the EU is not comprehensible to ordinary citizens, and the missing element in Macron\u2019s project is a credible plan to bring the countries of the EU together. That integration cannot just make sense to an establishment, it must make the resulting state-in-construction understandable (again) and above all acceptable to European citizens on democratic grounds, with a parliament and other institutions whose functions they can both grasp and affect with their votes, their views and their protests.\nA euro coin features a map of Europe REUTERS\/Toby Melville We should reflect on what that integration means. It means that European citizens will have to accept a government, which rules at least initially in the financial-economic sphere, and which thus makes decisions affecting their incomes, jobs, pensions and much more. These decisions will be made not by Spaniards for the Spanish or Finns for the Finnish, but by ministers likely to come from other countries, whose names and biographies are unknown to most and who will be unlikely to speak their language.\nWhere these decisions hurt the pockets or the job prospects of the governed \u2013 as they are bound to do, especially in times of low growth \u2013 will these ministers command assent, even if grudging? Or will the populist-nationalists receive a shot in the arm, and lead a revolt \u2013 the more widely supported for being attractive to both left and right?\nThat missing narrative \u2013 how to get from national to European democracy \u2013 is the fatal flaw of the Macron project. That weakness is one which will haunt him not just beyond the borders of France, but within them, since his large majority over Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front conceals the fact that several of the candidates defeated in the first round of last year\u2019s presidential election were almost as anti-EU as Le Pen \u2013 and with her, constituted a Euroskeptic majority.\nGiven the lack of a democratic \u201cstory\u201d for the EU, the need is not to pursue an integrationist pipe dream, but to strengthen national governments and in doing so, address the gulf which has opened up between the haves (have higher education, have secure jobs, have good salaries) and the have-littles (have little education, little secure employment, little pay. This does not mean abandoning the realization of a more closely-cooperating Europe. It has, in its seven decades of development, shown how useful cooperation is, how necessary it is to have common objectives and common action, how much the states can learn from each other. But they must learn from the Brexit vote that citizens demand an administration which is responsive to them, one they can hate, despise and condemn \u2013 but which they recognize as theirs, because it was elected by them.\nFor those states it may be that the oft-repeated intention of their governments to develop common policies under the command of European ministers will prove acceptable and will work. If so, they may prove an example to others, who presently stay out of the euro currency and, like the new, right-wing government of Austria, demand a return of many of the powers now centralized in the Brussels parliament.\nBut a move to centralize, and a further weakening of national administrations in favor of \u201cmore Europe\u201d, is unlikely to work; it simply cannot be squared with a democratic polity which enjoys respect and assent. Better now to recast the Union as a loose association of friendly states, which agrees on policies and projects where these make sense, but which remains under the aegis of national governments \u2013 familiar, accountable and the guarantor of rights and freedoms.

Revenue: $21.92 billion vs. $21.82 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters. \nA year earlier, Comcast reported adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share on revenue of $21.03 billion. \nShares were flat in Wednesday's premarket after the announcement. \nThe financial results of the owner of CNBC parent NBCUniversal set the stage for rivals that are also exploring combinations of content and internet services.\nCable and internet business \nComcast's Xfinity is one of the biggest residential providers of video, internet and phone. Comcast now has 29.3 million customers.\nComcast added 350,000 high-speed internet customers during the quarter, slightly less than a year earlier, but still the largest source of sales growth for the company. But 33,000 video customers left during the quarter, a change Comcast attributed to more \"aggressive\" offers from traditional and emerging competitors.\nStill, it's better than analysts expected. Comcast was expected to lose 45,000 video subscribers and gain 312,000 high-speed internet customers, according to a FactSet consensus estimate. Comcast lost 13,000 voice customers during the quarter, narrower than the 23,000 customer loss forecast by FactSet.\nMedia business \nNBC's film division had its most profitable year ever in its 105-year history, the company said Wednesday. In addiiton, Universal Pictures hit $5 billion at the global box office over the holidays for the second time ever. But during the quarter, film revenue dropped by about 5 percent, despite hits like \"Fate of the Furious,\" \"Despicable Me 3\" and the latest installment of \"Pitch Perfect.\"\nTheme parks, broadcast and cable networks also saw revenue increases from a year earlier, thanks to new attractions at the parks and distribution and content licensing.\nThe company has a big quarter ahead in media, with the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics next month.\nComcast's earnings is closely watched in the media industry. The combination of content and the \"pipes\" to deliver it is something that other companies are exploring as well: Verizon has Yahoo and AOL, and now Time Warner and AT&T hope to seal a merger deal. Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox are also joining forces.\nDisclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com."}

The organization is fully funded by CEFC China Energy, a Shanghai-based private conglomerate, according to its website. \nCEFC China Energy said in a statement posted on its website after the charges were announced in November that it had no investment in Uganda, and that it had acquired an investment in Chad from Taiwan\u2019s state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp without dealing directly with Chad\u2019s government. \n\u201cThe company will continue monitoring this matter and will take necessary measures based on developments,\u201d it said. \nProsecutors said Ho caused the energy company to offer a $2 million bribe to the president of Chad in 2015 in exchange for exclusive oil rights in that country. They said Gadio connected Ho with the president, and received $400,000 from Ho for his help. \nIdriss Deby has been Chad\u2019s president since 1990. The government of Chad has denied the U.S. charges. \nProsecutors also said that Ho caused $500,000 to be wired to Uganda\u2019s foreign minister in 2016, with the promise of further payments in the future, to secure favors for the Chinese company, including the potential acquisition of a Ugandan bank. \nSam Kutesa, who previously served as president of the U.N.

Prior to Fantag, Stone has been an active entrepreneur and investor in technology startups and served as a vice president at Apple where he reported directly to then-COO Tim Cook (now CEO). Apple acquired PowerSchool, a startup Stone co-founded in 1999 and which today serves more than 100 million users in 70 countries.\nFantag formally goes to market in 2018\nBrian Dombrowski -- Fantag's co-founder and former CEO -- made the decision to elevate Stone's role after an exceptional inaugural year developing the first iteration of the Fantag platform for customers and partners. As the company's new Chief Product Officer, Dombrowski will continue to lead the product vision and direct the adoption among the user community. Stone will focus on building the company and executing the go-to-market activities.\n\"2017 -- our first year -- was about developing our platform and rolling out pilots with key partners,\" said Dombrowski. \"2018 will be a year for growth, where we build upon all the business opportunities that surfaced in 2017 with the support of John's leadership. He's a proven market maker, and his track record in education -- a potentially new and explosive market for Fantag -- is already bearing fruit.\"\nStone brings a wealth of knowledge and connections to leaders in the sports industry. While at Bain & Company, he consulted for Nike and the NFL regarding their internet and e-commerce strategies. More recently, he advised the NBA's Sacramento Kings on their opportunity to redesign the live sports and entertainment experience in the team's new home at Golden 1 Center, a state-of-the-art sports-and-entertainment facility. Stone also serves as the board chair of the Sacramento chapter of the Positive Coaching Alliance, a national non-profit organization serving youth and high school sports.\nMomentum built with leading partners in 2017\nThe Fantag platform enables producers and spectators of live events to capture, replay, and share their favorite moments with a simple tap of a button on their mobile devices, and without having to record the video themselves.\nIn 2017, the company gained fast momentum by piloting its platform with a wide range of partners, including professional sports teams in the MLS, USL and the NBA G League. Fantag partner pilots in 2017 include media companies such as the Sinclair Broadcasting Group -- a major broadcaster of high school and other sporting events -- and MaxPreps, a division of CBS which has extensive reach into the high-school sports market. In addition, Fantag began forming partnerships with technology companies such as Telestream -- an industry leader in streaming software -- proving the value of Fantag as a foundational yet complementary platform for other technology companies and content creators in the sports-tech ecosystem.\nDiscovery\nFinally, Fantag's initial rollouts revealed an exciting new opportunity: to imagine the opportunities for the Fantag platform beyond sports. In its work with high schools, the company discovered the need for a video-based learning tool for education, where Fantag's technology can be used -- among other ways -- as a virtual note-taker. Stone's experience in education will help the company explore this new and untapped market opportunity.\n\"It's one of many reasons I accepted Brian's offer for the CEO job,\" said Stone. \"If not already, all live experiences will soon be transformed by video -- the more instant and digestible, the better. In 2018, we expect to make headway in a number of new markets, while continuing to establish traction with this game-changing technology in sports.\"\nAbout Fantag\nFantag delivers instant replay and video highlights to a user's mobile device from as many angles that capture the action. Using its patented cloud-based syncing platform, Fantag enables an intelligent exchange of short-form video between creators and consumers \u2014 and thereby establishing a new category of user-curated video content searchable by time, location, events and interests.

It initially worked with Goldman Sachs on a possible bid but subsequently decided to pull out, the sources said.\n\"While we would normally not comment on market speculation or rumors, in this instance we refute assertions that we are in negotiation for Pfizer's consumer business,\" J&J's vice president of media relations Ernie Knewitz told Reuters.\nGoldman was not immediately available to comment.\nGSK has hired JPMorgan and Citi to work on the deal, while Reckitt has turned to Bank of America, the five sources said.\nBritain's GSK and Reckitt declined to comment, as did JPMorgan, while Citi and Bank of America were not available.\nA spokeswoman for Pfizer, whose CEO Ian Read wants to focus on prescription medicines, declined to comment on the sale process, saying only that any decision on the future of the unit would be made in 2018.\nThe deal could be a game-changer for rival drugmaker GSK or consumer goods group Reckitt by making them one of the biggest global players in consumer health, an increasingly lucrative sector as ageing populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand for self-medication.\nAlthough consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very well known and durable brands with loyal customers.\nPrice matters The prospective sale, which is being organized by Centerview Partners, Guggenheim Securities and Morgan Stanley, was first mooted on Oct. 10, when Pfizer announced the strategic review for the unit, which had sales of about $3.4 billion in 2016.\nTwo of the sources said Pfizer valued the asset at more than 20 times its core earnings, or $20 billion, and was reluctant to accept less.\nBut J&J's decision to steer clear leaves the drugmaker with one less big bidder, which may affect its negotiating power.\nPfizer sold its previous consumer healthcare business to J&J in 2006 for $16.6 billion and the U.S. group, with interests from baby powder to cancer drugs, had been seen as a logical buyer for the current assets.\nYet it could have faced possible antitrust problems if it beefs up its presence in the sector, said one of the sources who is familiar with the company.\nPfizer aims to clinch a deal before the summer, another source said, adding that there had been enough interest in the asset to stage a competitive auction.\nA sale would confirm the consumer health sector, which is still fragmented, as fertile ground for deal-making following a spate of transactions in recent years.\nOther companies that are considering making bids include Swiss consumer food giant Nestle , said the five sources. Nestle's CEO Mark Shneider is a healthcare veteran and wants a deeper focus on nutrition, health and wellness.\nNestle declined to comment.\nThe firm recently sold its U.S. confectionery business to Italy's Ferrero for $2.8 billion. It is now seeking to buy Merck 's consumer health unit, sources have previously told Reuters, as part of its healthcare drive.\nBut while Pfizer's Centrum vitamin and Caltrate calcium supplements could fit with Nestle's new strategic direction, the U.S. firm's Advil painkillers and Robitussin cough medicine are far removed from its core businesses like coffee, chocolate and baby food, the sources said.\nA sixth source said Pfizer was likely to receive five or six bids in total. Pfizer CEO Read said on Oct. 31 that he expected no shortage of suitors for the business.\nReuters reported on Oct. 10 that established consumer health companies that may bid for Pfizer's unit include Abbott and Procter & Gamble ."}

A North Korean flag flutters on the top of their guard post inside North Korean territory in this picture taken near the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas in Paju, South Korea. REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji \nSouth Korea said the North had sent its consent for the talks to be held on Tuesday. The last time the two Koreas engaged in official talks was in December 2015. \nThe meeting will take place at the border truce village of Panmunjom where officials from both sides are expected to discuss the Winter Olympics, to be held in the South next month, and inter-Korean relations, South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told reporters. \nNorth Korea asked for further negotiations about the meeting to be carried out via documented exchanges, Baik said. \nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un opened the way for talks with South Korea in a New Year\u2019s Day speech in which he called for reduced tensions and flagged the North\u2019s possible participation in the Winter Olympics. \nBut Kim remained steadfast on the issue of nuclear weapons, saying the North would mass-produce nuclear missiles for operational deployment and warned he would launch a nuclear strike if his country was threatened. \nU.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday called the proposed inter-Korean talks a \u201cgood thing\u201d and he and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in announced that annual large-scale military drills would now take place after the Olympics. \nThe North sees the drills as preparations for invasion and justification for its weapons programmes that it conducts in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. \nTrump, who hurled fresh insults at the North Korean leader this week, took credit for any dialogue that takes place. \n\u201cDoes anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn\u2019t firm, strong and willing to commit our total \u2018might\u2019 against the North,\u201d Trump tweeted. \nIn an interview with CNN on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned that while it was Washington\u2019s aim to resolve the North Korean crisis diplomatically, \u201cthose diplomatic efforts are backed by a strong military option if necessary.\u201d A girl stands between binoculars that look towards the North, near the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas in Paju, South Korea. REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji \nHe said future talks involving the United States could allow North Korea to \u201cchart a way for themselves to a more secure future, a more prosperous future,\u201d and added: \u201cThey do know how to reach us if and when they are ready to engage with us as well.\u201d \nTillerson said how such talks might begin had yet to be determined, but North Korea would have to signal it understood that they would be aimed at \u201cfinal, full denuclearisation.\u201d \nNorth Korea regularly threatens to destroy the United States and its two key Asia allies, Japan and South Korea, and says its weapons are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. \nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang welcomed North and South Korea \u201ctaking positive steps to improve ties\u201d, and said the postponement of the exercises was \u201cwithout doubt a good thing\u201d. A South Korean government official checks the direct communications hotline to talk with the North Korean side at the border village of Panmunjom, South Korea. Yonhap via REUTERS \nChina\u2019s Commerce Ministry said it would limit exports of crude oil, refined oil products, steel and other metals to North Korea, in line with tough new sanctions imposed by the United Nations. \nJapanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera sounded a note of caution about the proposed talks. \n\u201cI think what is important is to maintain a firm defence posture,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cNorth Korea goes through phases of apparent dialogue and provocation, but either way, North Korea is continuing its nuclear and missile development. We have no intention of weakening our warning and surveillance.\u201d \nThe ramped-up momentum for inter-Korean dialogue follows a year of missile and nuclear tests by North Korea as well as an exchange of bellicose comments between Trump and Kim, which raised alarm across the world. \nEarlier this week, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Washington had heard reports that Pyongyang might be preparing to fire another missile. \nSouth Korea\u2019s defence ministry has said it had yet to see any evidence of an imminent missile launch. \nAnalysts with the website 38 North, which tracks North Korea, reported Pyongyang may be preparing to test a rocket engine at a facility in Sohae, North Pyongan province, where all of the North\u2019s satellite launches have taken place since 2012. \nCommercial satellite imagery from Dec. 25 showed a rail-mounted environment shelter had been moved away from a test stand, indicating that an engine test may be in the near future, the website said, rather than a new rocket launch suspected in recent media reports.

Picture taken on January 6, 2018. Jeff Overs\/BBC\/Handout via REUTERS \nToby Young quit his post on the board of the Office for Students, which is meant to help uphold standards in higher education, less than two days after May said he could keep it. \nHis resignation came amid a cabinet reshuffle meant to stamp May\u2019s authority on the government but derided in newspapers as a shambles, after one senior minister quit rather than take a new job and another talked May out of changing his role. \nYoung, whose memoir of a failed stint as a showbiz reporter was made into a 2008 movie, had reinvented himself as an education reform advocate, helping found a school in London run by parents under a programme introduced by May\u2019s Conservatives. \nBut his appointment to the universities body was met by a barrage of criticism because of a history of sexist and inappropriate remarks in articles and on social media. A petition calling for his dismissal gathered more than 220,000 signatures. \nIn 2012, he criticised the \u201cghastly\u201d need for schools to meet accessibility requirements for the disabled. He has also said women who \u201cdisplay a lot of cleavage shouldn\u2019t then complain when men notice them\u201d, described himself as a self-confessed pornography addict, and joked about being sexually aroused by images of hungry African children. \nHe has apologised for such comments, which he said dated to a career as a \u201cjournalistic provocateur\u201d and did not reflect his commitment to education. \n\u201cMy appointment has become a distraction from (the Office for Students\u2019) vital work of broadening access to higher education and defending academic freedom,\u201d Young said in a statement on the website of the Spectator magazine. \nRobert Halfon, the Conservative chairman of parliament\u2019s education committee, told BBC radio on Tuesday that Young\u2019s appointment had been a mistake. His appointment \u201chadn\u2019t possibly been considered with due diligence and I thought it was the wrong decision\u201d, Halfon said. \nOn Sunday, May said Young should be allowed to continue serving even though she condemned offensive comments he had made in the past. But the issue had damaged her attempts to rebrand her Conservative party as more inclusive during the ministerial reshuffle, which began on Monday and is aimed at promoting more women, black and younger lawmakers. \nThe reshuffle was triggered by the resignation of May\u2019s top ally in the cabinet, Damian Green, who was forced to quit after giving misleading statements about pornography on his laptop. \nMay, who lost her majority in parliament last year after calling a snap election that she expected to win in a landslide, has struggled to restore her authority over a party divided between supporters and opponents of a hard break with the EU.

{"published":"2018-01-04T02:00:00.000+02:00","title":"Commentary: Golden Globe 2018 Snubs Show Hollywood's Diversity Problem | Fortune","text":"By Nicholas Pearce January 4, 2018 \nSunday\u2019s 75th Golden Globe Awards ceremony shines a well-deserved spotlight on those being honored for excellence in film and television, but perhaps an even brighter one on some of those who are being overlooked: women directors. There are no women among this year\u2019s five nominees in the prestigious Best Director category. \nProviding access and opportunity to diverse talent is not just a feel-good way to manage optics in a precarious societal moment. Making room at the table for diverse talent and creating space for their voices to matter is a proven way to drive differentiated results. This is particularly important in industries like entertainment that rely on creativity, collaboration, and innovation. \nAccording to the Creative Artists Agency, at every level of budget, films with diverse casts outperform those that are more homogeneous. The UCLA Bunche Center\u2019s 2017 Hollywood Diversity Report found that films with diverse casts enjoyed above-average returns on investment and global box office receipts. These findings underscore decades of social and behavioral science that unambiguously reveal that social diversity (e.g., gender, race. etc.) when leveraged can enhance team functionality and bottom-line organizational performance. \nWhile this is certainly not the first year in which no women were nominated in this category, Hollywood\u2019s glaring gender achievement gap is especially notable at this moment, given that this industry is the very epicenter of the national #MeToo conversation. And it still sits in the shadow cast by the #OscarsSoWhite boycott protesting the lack of racial diversity among the Academy Awards\u2019 lead and supporting acting nominees. \nRather ironically, the Golden Globes\u2019 ignoring of female directors comes before the ink has dried on 2017, a year that The African American Film Critics Association proudly hailed as \u201c the year of the woman in cinema ,\u201d in recognition of unprecedented opportunities and successes for women filmmakers. Several deserving female directors were overlooked, including Patty Jenkins for Wonder Woman , Dee Rees for Mudbound , and Greta Gerwig for Lady Bird . (Perhaps Ava DuVernay will be nominated next year for directing A Wrinkle in Time .) Therefore, it cannot be said there were no women whose directorial prowess was worthy of at least garnering a nomination for recognition this year. \nTo be sure, there are notable snubs every year in every awards show\u2014but this is not about individual snubs. Since 1944, only four women have ever been nominated for a Golden Globe in the Best Director category. And only four women have ever been nominated for a Best Director Oscar since the Academy Awards began in 1929. Historically, a paucity of directors in top-grossing films have been female, and many industry executives have operated with a \u201cthink director, think male\u201d mindset. The evidence suggests that this phenomenon is about far more than isolated individual snubs\u2014this is about pervasive, industry-level collective bias, discriminatory hiring practices, and a sustained pattern of systemic inequality. A recent investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission agrees. \nThe commitment to advocating for diverse talent must be matched by a commitment to advancing diverse talent. As a Hollywood insider recently tweeted , \u201cThe main thing the Golden Globes gives a nominee is visibility.\u201d Advocating for more diverse directors in Hollywood is indeed necessary, but insufficient. When diverse talent is not sponsored into career-accelerating leadership opportunities and find themselves perennially shut out from the opportunity to gain organization-wide or industry-wide visibility, it is a recipe for sustained systemic inequality. The false narrative that diversity and excellence are mutually exclusive must be rejected. Advocacy must be matched with action. As Frederick Douglass said, \u201cPower concedes nothing without a demand.\u201d \n\nThe long road to achieving equity requires authentic allyship and sponsorship. The Golden Globes will reportedly be the setting for a blackout : Several women are planning to dress in black as an act of protest against sexual harassment and violence, and many men are expected to dress in black as a show of solidarity. However, true allyship must extend beyond marches, hashtags, and minimally inconvenient wardrobe choices. Such moments of embodied solidarity may often originate from a sincere desire to be helpful and may provide meaningful socioemotional support, but often do little to remedy the structural inequality that precipitated these moments of protest in the first place. While diversity and inclusion may benefit individual careers, the heavier lift of equity and social justice can influence organizations, industries, and societies for generations to come. \nNicholas Pearce serves as an award-winning clinical professor of management & organizations at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management and CEO of The Vocati Group.

Scientists have ruled out the most exotic explanation -- an orbiting alien mega-structure -- for the behavior of a celestial oddity dubbed Tabby\u2019s Star that has been puzzling scientists with its sporadic dimming and brightening. An illustration depicts a hypothetical uneven ring of dust orbiting Tabby's Star (KIC 8462852) released October 4, 2017 by JPL-Caltech and obtained by REUTERS January 3, 2018. NASA\/JPL-Caltech\/Handout via REUTERS \nAstronomers said on Wednesday that the most thorough study to date of the star, officially called KIC 8462852, showed that its dimming episodes are not caused by a large opaque object passing in front of it. The dimming could be due to some sort of dust, they added, though the cause remains uncertain. \nThe researchers relied on observations of Tabby\u2019s Star from March 2016 to December 2017 using Las Cumbres Observatory telescopes in Maui and the Canary Islands. The star is named after Louisiana State University astrophysicist Tabetha Boyajian, who was instrumental in identifying its idiosyncrasies in 2015. \nBeginning in May 2017, the scientists observed four episodes when the star\u2019s light dipped. The data showed less dimming in the star\u2019s red light than in its blue light, and a large opaque object would dim all colors of light equally when passing in front of a star, Boyajian said. \n\u201cWe took measures of the star\u2019s brightness in several colors. Data taken in this way can inform us on what kind of material is passing in front of the star,\u201d Boyajian added. \nNumerous hypotheses have been offered about the star\u2019s occasional dimming, including a hypothetical mega-structure called a Dyson Sphere built to surround a star and harvest its energy output. \n\u201cSure, it\u2019s disappointing that this isn\u2019t the anomaly that will turn out to be that big discovery. But we always knew the chances were low. It\u2019s like finding out that your lottery ticket isn\u2019t a winner: disappointing, but not surprising,\u201d said another of the researchers, Penn State astrophysicist Jason Wright. \nTabby\u2019s star, roughly 40 percent more massive than the sun, is located about 1,280 light-years away from our solar system in the constellation Cygnus. Its light has been observed dimming as much as 22 percent. \nThe new observations were consistent with the effects of dust -- fine grains of material -- on the starlight, Wright said. There was no hint of gas along with the dust, Wright said. \n\u201cWe still aren\u2019t 100 percent sure where the dust is, but it seems to be somewhere around the star,\u201d Wright added. \u201cWe\u2019re still not sure where it\u2019s coming from -- maybe colliding asteroids or comets.\u201d \nThe findings were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

While that seems like a no-brainer for a market that has skyrocketed 325 percent since the crisis lows, investors in general and millennials in particular have been afraid of equities, worried that another crisis could sneak up and wipe out all those gains. \nNot Smith, who has taken a slice of his trust fund and put it to work on Wall Street. \n\"The market's becoming a little more insulated,\" he said. \"I'm hoping that we learned our lesson from [the crisis] and we have gotten better as a society, especially in the financial and banking world, that we will not allow that again, that certain measure have been put in place since then.\" \nMillennials, born between the early 1980s and early 2000s, have been the most reluctant demographic when it comes to diving into risk assets. For instance, a Bankrate survey in 2017 showed just 13 percent would invest in equities, trailing real estate and cash by large margins. \nBut with the market showing stunning resiliency , the tide is turning. Getty Images \nA survey released Tuesday by megamoney manager BlackRock indicated a big jump in millennial interest in exchange-traded funds, a $3.3 trillion industry populated mostly with securities that track stock market indexes. (Bond funds are getting more popular but still make up only about 16 percent of ETF assets.) \nThe portion of millennials who are buying ETFs jumped from 33 percent in 2016 to 42 percent a year later. That pushes the group to the top of the list in terms of ETF ownership. Silvers (age 71 or older) are next at 37 percent, followed by Gen Xers (29 percent) and baby boomers (27 percent). \nOverall, investors continue to push money into the low-cost funds, with the industry now boasting $3.3 trillion of assets under management, a 27 percent jump from a year earlier, according to the Investment Company Institute. About 1 in 3 investors uses ETFs, a 24 percent increase from a year ago, according to BlackRock, the industry leader with $1.4 trillion of its total $5.7 trillion under management in the funds. \nSmith uses a mix of individual stocks and ETFs for his portfolio after initially trusting his investments with a money manager, an experience that was positive but served to whet his appetite for striking out on his own. \nHis portfolio is loaded with popular tech names like Nvidia , Facebook and Netflix , but he's also studying to learn about options trading. He's also recently taken a shot at cryptocurrencies, which he said worries him more than stocks. \nOne factor influencing his appetite for risk: President Donald Trump . \n\"Trump does seem to be much more pro-economy and pro-American stock market than other past presidents,\" Smith said. \"While he's in office I believe there's an extra layer of insulation there from something drastic and catastrophic from happening.\" \nWATCH: Millennials will help contribute to the stock boom, economist says. show chapters "}

{"published":"2018-01-24T01:32:00.000+02:00","title":"Employees at Practice Fusion expected IPO riches, but got nothing as execs pocketed millions","text":"When Practice Fusion , a medical records start-up, sold to AllScripts for $100 million this month , it was a massive disappointment for employees and investors. Only two years earlier, their stock in the company was reportedly worth 15 times the purchase price.\nStart-ups crash and burn all the time. It's an inherent risk and one that's understood across Silicon Valley.\nBut Practice Fusion stakeholders told CNBC they were misled by an executive team that was projecting a bright future as momentum was stalling. In the end, mid-level employees were left with nothing, and many who departed the San Francisco-based company and exercised their options lost tens of thousands of dollars.\nFounded in 2005, Practice Fusion competes in the crowded electronic medical records market and discovered a niche by offering free software that was popular among small and solo physician practices. Practice Fusion and other electronic health records companies benefited from legislation passed in 2009 that incentivized doctors to digitize their paper records.\nInstead of charging for its software, Practice Fusion generates the bulk of its revenues through advertising to doctors. It previously experimented with other revenue models like virtual video visits.\nSource: Platform Matthew Douglass and Ryan Howard of Practice Fusion Backed by high-profile venture firms like Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Practice Fusion had reeled in over $150 million in private funding with the promise of bringing electronic health records to the cloud, and was reportedly valued at $700 million in 2013.\nThe business was apparently in such a groove that in January 2016, the New York Times reported that Practice Fusion had hired J.P. Morgan to explore an IPO valuing the company at up to $1.5 billion. Revenue was estimated to reach $181 million by 2018, the story said, citing financial documents.\nFar from denying the report, Practice Fusion told the Times that an IPO \"could potentially be an outcome.\"\nLow bids Internally, a very different story was unfolding. After several years of missed targets and a management shake-up that resulted in the ouster of founder and CEO Ryan Howard, the board was quietly looking for a way out. \nConfidential documents obtained by CNBC reveal that the board had started seeking a potential buyer in November 2015, several months before the Times report, and had hired Evercore to help it solicit interest. As many as 40 potential buyers were contacted, with bids ranging from $50 million to $225 million -- a fraction of its desired IPO valuation.\nFinancial statements show that the company was well shy of the financial metrics reported by the Times and that the business was starting to decline. Following a revenue jump of 70 percent in 2015 (the final year of Howard's tenure), growth slowed to 13 percent in 2016, closing the year at about $54 million. Through the first nine months of 2017, sales declined 10 percent from the same period in the previous year -- from $37 million to $34 million.\nPractice Fusion was also downsizing. The company eliminated one-quarter of its workforce -- 74 people -- in February 2016. But Beth Seidenerg, a director and Kleiner Perkins partner, told TechCrunch that there was no cause for alarm. CEO Tom Langan described the move as necessary to get the company to a profit, at the same time that low-priced acquisition offers were starting to accumulate.\nAt its peak under Howard, the company employed more than 400 people. It's now down to about 200 employees, sources said.\nThe highest offer Practice Fusion received came in May 2017 from its eventual buyer, AllScripts, which was proposing $225 million to $250 million, according to the confidential documents. That deal fell apart after the news broke that a company in the same space, eClinicalWorks, had misled customers about the certification of its health IT software, resulting in a $155 million settlement and a $1 billion class-action lawsuit.\nThe eventual sale to AllScripts at less than half the amount proposed last year means that ordinary employees and common stockholders get nothing, while managers are banking millions from the pre-arranged carve-out. \nIf the deal is approved by shareholders, Langan will personally pocket $7 million, according to a proposal viewed by CNBC.\nStephen Byrnes, the general counsel, would earn $2.2 million, Chief Strategy and Corporate Development Officer Riyad Omar will make $2.3 million and Chief Technology Officer Jonathan Malek will get paid $2.25 million. Stacey Rubin, vice president of people and the only woman in the group, will net almost $750,000.\nBoth the acquisition and the management payout still have to get approved by Practice Fusion shareholders, with the biggest investors having the most influence in the result. Some workers are banding together to try and vote down both the management carve-out and the acquisition, according to sources familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because their discussions are private.\nPractice Fusion said in an e-mailed statement that it was following typical start-up practices.\n\"In the Bay Area, start-up companies pursue financings with terms that vary in their complexity, such as preferred stock liquidation preferences,\" the statement said. \"Planning for potential acquisition exits also includes having bonus pools for key employees (which include founders and current executives) that align their incentives with company stakeholders to achieve value upon an exit.\"\n'Very few Facebook-like exits' Meanwhile, some common shareholders are not only out of luck but also a lot of money. CNBC talked to three former employees who lost between $40,000 and over $100,000 each because they exercised their options in previous years and had to pay tax based on their heightened value at the time.\nChris Hogg , a former data scientist at Practice Fusion who joined in 2013 through the acquisition of his start-up 100Plus, said that most employees don't understand the dilutive effect of multiple rounds of fundraising. \n\"There are very few Facebook-like exits where multiple early employees make millions of dollars,\" Hogg said.\nCharley Moore spent years as a start-up lawyer before creating Rocket Lawyer, which provides automated legal advice to entrepreneurs and their employees. He said Practice Fusion is a cautionary tale.\n\"Venture capital, like baseball, is a game of failure,\" said Moore, who represented companies including Yahoo. \"Most things simply don't work and, even if they do, it can take much longer to realize value than employees might think.\""}

{"published":"2018-01-18T22:39:00.000+02:00","title":"Commentary: 'Religious Liberty' Is Not an Excuse to Deny Transgender People Medical Care - Fortune","text":"By Steve Sanders January 18, 2018 \nThe Trump administration is developing a policy that would empower health care workers to refuse to participate in abortions or treat transgender patients. According to Politico , the new rules would punish health care organizations that don\u2019t give employees an opportunity to object to treating patients for religious or moral reasons . The Department of Health and Human Services is creating a new division within its Office of Civil Rights to investigate such complaints. \nThis is a perilous new policy, as it has the potential to impede access to care, insult the dignity of patients, and allow religious beliefs to override mainstream medical science. \nEmployee religious accommodations are part of American law because they advance values of tolerance and pluralism. But it has always been understood that accommodations must be drawn carefully to avoid unduly burdening an employer or harming the interests of third parties. \nFor example, under federal law, an employer must make reasonable efforts to accommodate an employee who can\u2019t work on their Sabbath. But the accommodation need not be granted if it would cause the employer more than a minimal hardship. And accommodating one employee\u2019s religious observance does not mean a coworker with seniority can be forced to give up part of their weekend to cover the employer\u2019s staffing needs. \nCaution also is necessary with accommodations because often there is no way to differentiate between genuine religious convictions and beliefs that are made up out of convenience. Because religious beliefs are inherently personal and not subject to conventional forms of proof, an employer is usually powerless to question them. And so an employee who merely has a phobia toward transgender people might still claim a \u201creligious\u201d exemption, and the employer would have little choice but to grant it. \nA religious exemption for participating in an abortion is more understandable, given that an employee could be forced into performing a procedure that they see as the taking of a life. By contrast, it is unclear what legitimate objection a health care worker could have to treating a transgender person. \nSuch claims really come down to religious attitudes that say there can be no such thing as a transgender man or woman. As already mentioned, there is no way of proving whether such an attitude comes from legitimate religious belief or simply from an individual employee\u2019s distaste toward transgender people. \nTransgender people get colds, backaches, and cancer like everyone else. Will the new policy be so broadly written that a nurse might believe they can refuse to administer chemotherapy drugs to a patient who happens to be trans? Even if that is not the policy\u2019s intent, it is foreseeable that such humiliating incidents could occur. \nTransgender people also sometimes require specific care related to gender transition, such as surgeries, hormones, or counseling. Now, if a doctor cannot treat a patient\u2019s condition because they lack the necessary professional competencies, they should not be forced to do so. But the Trump administration is allowing something different than that\u2014for a medical decision to be based on moral animus toward the very existence of transgender people. \nThere is reason to doubt whether the new Trump policy will carefully balance the interests of all concerned. The new rules appear to be a political reward to the Christian right, part of Trump\u2019s all-important base. They\u2019re being spearheaded by former Heritage Foundation activist Roger Severino, who has long promoted the idea that law must favor religious viewpoints over the rights of LGBTQ people. \nHealth policy making should not be outsourced to Christian conservatives who deny that a person can medically change their gender identity. It does not matter to these conservatives that gender dysphoria is a recognized diagnosis with established treatment protocols. They believe transition-related medical care can be refused because transgender people are, according to an essay in the religious-conservative journal Public Discourse , an \u201cabsurdity,\u201d and \u201c[n]o amount of surgical mutilation of body parts, effeminate behaviors, or artificial female appearances can make a man a woman .\u201d \nTrump\u2019s new policy would empower workers to withhold care because they object to a patient\u2019s identity and because such workers believe their religious liberty allows them to denigrate the patient\u2019s very being. Government should not place its authority behind religion when it would require a health care organization to deny someone not only care, but basic human dignity. \nSteve Sanders is an associate professor of law at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law.

That\u2019s down nearly 15 percent from $140 billion in 2012. \nTrading accounted for revenues of $61.1 billion in the first half of 2017, Coalition figures show. As the bulk of trading activity is conducted in the first six months of any year, it looks like the 2017 total will be the lowest in years. \nMost of the decline is in fixed income, currency and commodities -- or FICC -- trading, where regulation has been tightened most and where banks have pulled back most. Equity trading is holding up better but remains a far smaller share of banks\u2019 trading pie than FICC. \nThe new year is only a few days old but there is no sign of a pick-up in market volatility, a prerequisite for a rebound in trading activity and revenue. \nThe VIX index of implied volatility on Wall Street has traded below 9 percent on only seven days since its launch nearly 30 years ago. Six have been in the last six months, and two of them have been this week. \nEven though the Fed is raising U.S. interest rates and other central banks are gradually turning off the stimulus taps, currency and bond market volatility remains anchored near historic lows too. $104 BILLION BONANZA \nIn a world of weak trading, equity capital market (ECM) and debt capital market (DCM) activity is commanding a greater share of big banks\u2019 revenues and profits with every passing year. \nA bumper 2017 was always likely given that last year saw a high number and value of deals across equity and debt markets, the lowest stock and bond volatility on record, and dozens of new highs for global stock markets. \nEven still, it was a remarkable year for fees. The record $104 billion was comprised of $28.1 billion from M&A advisory services, $31.3 bln from DCM activity, $22.4 bln from ECM underwriting and $22.2 bln from syndicating loans. \nECM fees leapt 42 percent to a three-year high of $22.4 billion. As a share of overall ECM activity that was 2.9 percent, according to Reuters calculations -- the highest in at least a decade and well up from 2.1 percent in 2016. \nThe surge in ECM fees far outstripped the rise in ECM activity and transaction value. \nCompanies raised $783.7 billion in equity during 2017, up 18 percent from the previous year and the strongest annual period for global ECM issuance in two years. The 5,735 ECM offerings during the year marked a rise of 21 percent over 2016 and was the strongest full-year period since records began in 1980, the Reuters data showed. \nDCM fees rose 15 percent to a new record $31.3 billion. Always tiny compared to overall DCM transactions, they rose to 0.4 percent of the value of transactions from 0.3 percent in 2016, according to Reuters calculations. \nAgain, the rise in fees wasn\u2019t matched by changes in the value or number of transactions. The number of debt issues globally rose 11 percent to 23,321, a new record for a calendar year while DCM activity actually slipped to $7.2 trillion, although that was the second consecutive year above $7 trillion.

A crane, airbags, or a combination of the two, would be used to raise the plane from the riverbed as gently as possible. \nThe plane is submerged in 13 metres of water near Cowan, about 40 km (25 miles) north of Sydney. \nNagy said investigators would also look for any other electronic devices, including iPads or iPhones, that may have been on board when the plane crashed on Sunday, killing Compass chief executive Richard Cousins, 58, and four members of his family. The pilot, Gareth Morgan, 44, was also killed. \nA preliminary report into the crash will be made public in about a month, although authorities have warned it may take up to a year to find out what happened. \n\u201cIf we do identify any critical safety issues throughout the course of the investigation, we will immediately notify the relevant authorities \u2026 to remedy any issues,\u201d Nagy said. \n\u201cThis particular aircraft, I understand was manufactured in 1963, it\u2019s not unusual to have aircraft of that sort of age flying around \u2026 we haven\u2019t seen any systemic issues around this aircraft,\u201d he added. \nAustralian police have identified those killed with Cousins as Emma Bowden, 48, Heather Bowden, 11, Edward Cousins, 23, and William Cousins, 25. \nFamily members and media reports identified four of the victims Cousins\u2019 two sons, his fianc\u00e9e and her daughter. \nCousins, who led Compass over the past 11 years, was due to step down in March after being widely credited with turning the company\u2019s business around and making it into one of the Financial Times Stock Exchange\u2019s best-performing firms. \nThe seaplane was part of the Sydney Seaplanes business that has operated since 2005 with no previous record of mishap.

Lynch 6 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday rescinded an Obama administration policy that had eased enforcement of federal marijuana laws in states that legalized the drug, instead giving federal prosecutors wide latitude to pursue criminal charges. \nThe action by Attorney General Jeff Sessions could have damaging consequences for the burgeoning marijuana industry in the six states including California and Colorado that have legalized the drug for recreational use, plus dozens of others that permit medicinal use. \nJustice Department officials declined to say whether they might take legal action against those states, saying further steps were \u201cstill under consideration.\u201d \nFederal law still prohibits marijuana even as some states move to legalize it. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said President Donald Trump\u2019s top priority was enforcing federal law \u201cwhether it\u2019s marijuana or immigration.\u201d \nThe policy change, detailed by Sessions in a one-page memo to federal prosecutors nationwide, came three days after California formally launched the world\u2019s largest regulated commercial market for recreational marijuana. \nThe administration\u2019s action drew condemnation from marijuana legalization advocates and politicians in both parties in states where the drug has been legalized. They said it trampled on the rights of voters in those states and created uncertainty about how strictly federal drugs laws will be enforced. \nThe move raised questions about how it might impact tax revenues in states that permit some form of legal marijuana use. It also created uncertainty for banks, already fearful about business relationships with the marijuana industry because of concerns they might run afoul of anti-money laundering rules. \nThere has been a surge in legalization of marijuana at the state level in recent years. Other states that permit the regulated sale of marijuana for recreational use include Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and Nevada. Massachusetts and Maine are on track to do so this year. \nThe policy put in place under Democratic former President Barack Obama, outlined by then-Deputy Attorney General James Cole in a series of memos, had discouraged federal prosecutors from pursuing marijuana-related criminal cases in states that had legalized the drug. \nSessions said in a statement that the Obama-era policy \u201cundermines the rule of law\u201d and told federal prosecutors in his memo to \u201cfollow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions\u201d in deciding which marijuana-related activities to prosecute. \nSome prosecutors in legalization states issued statements on how they would proceed. A U.S. attorney in Colorado said he would not change his approach toward marijuana prosecutions, while a U.S. attorney in Massachusetts said he would pursue federal marijuana criminal cases. FILE PHOTO: Customers shop for \"Green Friday\" deals at the Grass Station marijuana shop on Black Friday in Denver, Colorado, U.S., November 28, 2014. REUTERS\/Rick Wilking\/File Photo \nThe Trump administration\u2019s action seemed incongruous with comments that Trump, a Republican, made during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump told a TV news reporter that the decision to legalize marijuana should be left \u201cup to the states.\u201d \n\u2018DEFIES FACTS AND LOGIC\u2019 \nCalifornia Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said his state will pursue \u201call legal, legislative and political options to protect its reforms and its rights as a state.\u201d He said the Trump administration\u2019s position \u201cdefies facts and logic.\u201d \nRepublican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado said on Twitter that the administration\u2019s action \u201cdirectly contradicts what Attorney General Sessions told me prior to his confirmation.\u201d \nGardner said he would take all steps necessary to fight the measure, including possibly holding up the Senate from voting on pending Justice Department nominees. \nThe Obama-era policy recognised marijuana as a \u201cdangerous drug,\u201d but said the Justice Department expected states and localities that authorized various uses to effectively regulate and police it. \nAmong companies that have invested in the industry, Scotts Miracle-Gro ( SMG.N ), a gardening product manufacturer, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire companies that sell soil, lighting, fertilizer and other products to marijuana growers. Shares in the company closed down about 2.3 percent. Several Canadian marijuana-related stocks also fell. \nMarijuana startup companies said they were now bracing for a deceleration in funding. \n\u201cIn the short term, this news will further scare away investors, which will, in turn, slow down cannabis entrepreneurship,\u201d said Nicolas Ruiz, co-founder of Cloudponics, a San Francisco startup whose technology can be used to grow marijuana. \nFunding for such startups has been on an upswing since Colorado\u2019s legalization of recreational marijuana use in 2014. Since then, the industry has amassed nearly $1.3 billion in private equity funding for marijuana startups, with more than $600 million in 2017 alone, according to research firm CB Insights. \nThe Sessions memo did not distinguish between enforcement against marijuana used for recreational versus medicinal purposes. But his department\u2019s ability to pursue criminal charges related to medicinal marijuana remains in doubt. \nSince 2014, federal lawmakers have attached language to spending legislation that explicitly bars the Justice Department from spending resources to enforce cases in states where medicinal marijuana is legal.

On the worldwide chart, it's now 24th with $1.04 billion, edging Universal-Illumination's \"Despicable Me 3.\" The tentpole's international total, currently at $523.2 million, will see a significant jolt when it opens on Jan. 5 in China, its final market.\n\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" has also topped Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast,\" which grossed $504 million in North America, for the top spot among 2017 releases domestically. It's the fourth 2017 title to go past $1 billion worldwide, along with \"Beauty and the Beast\" at $1.26 billion, \"The Fate of the Furious\" at $1.24 billion and \"Despicable Me 3\" at $1.03 billion.\n\"The Last Jedi\" is also winning the domestic weekend box office crown for the third time with $52.4 million, edging Sony's \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,\" which took in $50.6 million at 3,765 locations for the Friday-Sunday. However, Sony's projection showed the \"Jumanji\" sequel grossing $16.5 million on New Year's Day on Monday -- well above Disney's forecast of $13.2 million for \"The Last Jedi.\" Should those numbers hold, \"Jumanji\" would edge \"Jedi\" over the four-day period with $67 million, winning by $1.4 million.\n\"Jumanji\" has been \"The Last Jedi's\" biggest competitor by far since it opened on Dec. 20. The action-comedy should wind up with an 11-day domestic total of $186.3 million by the end of Monday. The action-comedy, starring Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, has a $90 million budget. It's also performed impressively in international markets with $107 million thr0ugh Dec. 28.\n\"Jedi\" and \"Jumanji\" helped lift the entire domestic box office for 2017 to $11.12 billion, down 2.3% from last year's $11.38 billion and off slightly from 2015's $11.14 billion, according to comScore. The gap for 2017 had been more than 6% at the end of the worst summer in a decade but performances by \"It,\" \"Thor: Ragnarok,\" \"Justice League,\" \"Jedi\" and \"Jumanji\" closed most of that margin.\n\"With another $11 billion plus year on the books, the industry looks ahead to awards season and a 2018 packed with blockbuster titles and a hope for a year slightly less volatile than 2017,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with comScore. Universal's \"Pitch Perfect 3\" led the rest of weekend's domestic pack with a projected $22.7 million at 3,468 locations for Friday-Monday, lifting its 11-day total to $69.2 million. The comedy threequel, starring Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson, took in $13.1 million this weekend from 34 international markets for a foreign total of $28.6 million.\nHugh Jackman's musical drama \"The Greatest Showman\" is finishing a close fourth with $20.3 million at 3,316 theaters forecasted for the four days. The Fox-Chernin Entertainment title showed the biggest gain in the top 10 movies from the Christmas Eve weekend with an impressive 73% surge. The domestic total should hit $53.8 million through Monday.\nFox's second weekend of \"Ferdinand\" -- the only film to open on the same weekend as \"The Last Jedi\" -- followed in fifth with $15.1 million at 3,337 North American venues, giving the animated comedy $57.3 million in 18 days. Disney-Pixar's seventh weekend of \"Coco\" finished sixth with a projected $8.8 million at 2,845 sites for a domestic total of $181.1 million and $539 million worldwide.\nSony's \"All the Money in the World\" and Focus Features' \"The Darkest Hour\" were in a battle for seventh place at about $7.2 million for the four days. \"All the Money\" opened on Christmas Day as the final wide release of the year at 2,074 locations after director Ridley Scott excised Kevin Spacey's scenes and reshot them with Christopher Plummer as J. Paul Getty, following the early November sexual abuse allegations against Spacey. Its eight-day total will be around $14.4 million.\nAwards contender \"Darkest Hour,\" starring Gary Oldman as the 1940 version of Winston Churchill, expanded to 943 venues in its sixth weekend and will have taken in $19.8 million by the end of the weekend. Focus reported strong performance in Washington, D.C.\/Maryland, Phoenix, Boston, Salt Lake City, and Florida markets.\n\"'Darkest Hour' is taking America by storm,\" said distribution chief Lisa Bunnell. \"We're seeing audiences coming out in big numbers. It's a movie they found inspiring over the holiday break and the word of mouth gives us a strong outlook for the upcoming weeks.\"\nMatt Damon's comedy-drama \"Downsizing\" finished ninth with a projected $6 million at 2,664 sites for the four days for Paramount. The 11-day total for \"Downsizing,\" which carries a $65 million budget and was directed by Alexander Payne, should come in around $18.5 million.\nWarner Bros.-Alcon Entertainment's second weekend of R-rated comedy \"Father Figures\" rounded out the top 10 with a projected $5.5 million at 2,902 locations. The 11-day total for the Owen Wilson-Ed Helms vehicle, which has a $25 million price tag, should hit about $14 million."}

Treasury yields hit their highest level since 2014 on Thursday.\nScott Olson | Getty Images Market gurus, including Jeff Gundlach and Ray Dalio, recently have sounded sour notes on bonds, with Gundlach's firm DoubleLine Capital saying that, among stock market hedges, it's commodities that look like a good bet for 2018 and that bond yields, which move inversely to bond prices, will continue to rise.\nBill Gross said last week that, after more than 30 years, the bond bear market has begun. The world's largest money manager, BlackRock, came into 2018 without a single overweight recommendation in the fixed-income universe.\nInvesting legend Bill Miller said in his latest letter to investors this week, \"I believe that if rates rise in 2018, taking the 10-year treasury above 3 percent, that will propel stocks significantly higher, as money exits bond funds for only the second year in the past 10. ... Bonds, in my opinion, have entered a bear market,\" Miller wrote, but he added, \"one that is likely to be benign for the next year or so.\" \nOne underlying data point that Miller's letter highlights is that investor interest in bond funds is not a sudden shift. Trimtabs data shows that bond funds took in more than $400 billion in 2017.\nCore bond funds are already down by 1 percent in 2018, and financial advisors expect those losses to accelerate. \n\"[10-year treasury] rates have risen and if they go above 3, we will see bond funds down 2, 3, 4 and 5 percent,\" said Mitch Goldberg, president of investment advisory firm ClientFirst Strategy. \n\"Is it a crushing blow? No. But it is significant,\" Goldberg said. \"If you ask the average investor if they think they can you lose money on a bond fund, I think they would say no.\n\"But this year they are more likely to be wrong than right in answering that way.\"\nBut Goldberg stressed sticking with bonds is also the lesser of two evils when compared to investors tinkering with long-term investing plans and portfolio allocations.\nInvestors have reasons to buy unloved bonds It may seem counterintuitive, but there's plenty of support for the argument that investors are actually doing the right thing by moving into bonds. It is annual portfolio rebalancing season and, given the huge gains in all stock markets around the world last year, portfolio allocations between stocks and bonds would have moved well away from target weightings.\n\"You can't escape the fact that, for most investors, bonds will make up a portion of their portfolio,\" said Douglas Boneparth, president and founder of Bone Fide Wealth and a member of the CNBC Digital Finance Advisor Council. \"Even millennial clients we work with have 20 percent in fixed income.\"\nBoneparth said that, based on his recent moves, the most likely explanation for the surge into bond funds is rebalancing. \"We've been watching 5 to 10 percent of portfolios that have created built- in risk over the past few years and now are moving out of equities and back into fixed income,\" he said. \"You're probably seeing a lot of that take place at the retail level.\"\nMore from Investor Toolkit: \nInvesting with borrowed money can be a big win \nThe biggest risks for 2018 \nFinancial planning is not meant to be a quick fix \nWhile it may reflect a stay-the-course philosophy, it still leaves Trimtabs' Santschi scratching his head \u2014 and issuing a warning.\n\"It doesn't bode well for the bond market to see this retail enthusiasm,\" he said. \"Usually when retail investors buy, they tend to be wrong.\"\nThe Trimtabs CEO said that, even accepting the argument about annual rebalancing and the fact that an aging demographic has greater need for income investments, investors could choose to go into cash or cash equivalents instead of bonds likely to go down in value. Some bank certificates of deposit are now yielding as much, in some cases more, than Treasurys. \"There are other asset classes than stocks and bonds,\" Santschi said. \"There's cash, real estate, commodities, precious metals.\" \nCash equivalents and inflation-protection are alternatives Goldberg said that investors who continue to hold longer-term bonds should expect fluctuations and, if they look closely at statement this year, losses in the bond holdings. But it's not a reason to sell. And most retail investors aren't in bonds for the total return (i.e., performance) anyway. But they do need to understand that the market mechanics are much stronger for stocks than bonds now.\nFor his investors, with anywhere from 10 percent to 60 percent in fixed-income, he is favoring cash equivalents and treasury-inflation protected bonds rather than core bond holdings. \n\"I have concerns,\" Goldberg added. \"We prefer cash equivalents.\"\nHe said money markets are now yielding more than 1 percent and, at that yield, one of the major drawbacks of money market funds is erased: The fees they charge are no longer eroding the yield generated. \nGoldberg added that there is also nothing wrong with using bank CDs, though the ones that offer yields as high as 10-year Treasurys may have long-term holding requirements and potentially fees on early withdrawals. But he said many financial advisors don't like bank CDs because it means allowing a client to take a money to another institution.\n\"I feel strongly that bonds aren't an asset to load up on. Rebalancing is the only reason that makes sense.\" He added that many investors won't see \"the carnage in the bond market \"until their March statement, and even then, most won't even notice it as long as stocks remain strong and the overall statement value is higher.\nBut they should be aware of the overall dynamic sooner rather than later. \"Safe havens aren't always so safe,\" he said. \"It's been over 30 years since investors had to take major losses in bonds.\nshow chapters Rates will push higher with more growth: DoubleLine Capital's Jeffrey Sherman      2 Hours Ago | 05:31 The theme of investing in a rising interest rate environment is not new; in fact, it has been overhyped in years past, most notable during the taper tantrum. But Goldberg said there has been so much literature from asset management companies stating case for bonds in a low interest rate environment they now should find it harder to justify bonds when the interest rate environment changes.\n\"It is significant now,\" he said. \"No one anymore can really deny the growth story, the China credit bubble, consumer credit or the Fed.\n\"Whatever people used to doubt stocks people have to start acknowledging the economy has past the point of escape velocity,\" Goldberg said. \"It is growing and worldwide, so rates deserve to go higher, and that's a good thing for the economy.\n\"I'd be more worried if rates weren't rising,\" he said, adding that he thinks the Fed may raise rates as many as four times this year.\nBoneparth at Bone Fine Wealth said statements from market figures as prominent as Ray Dalio that say it looks like 1980-81 as far as a bear market for bonds goes may get the attention, but he gave up on trying to call the end of the bond bull market a few years ago when rates hit 1.5 percent.\nYour Wealth: Weekly advice on managing your money Sign up to get Your Wealth \nJob Industry Advertising\/Marketing Automotive Communications\/PR Construction\/Manufacturing Education Finance\/Banking\/Insurance Legal Media\/Entertainment Medical\/Health Care Mining\/Oil\/Gas\/Utilities Gov't\/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology\/IT Transportation\/Shipping Travel\/Hospitality Other Submit Please enter a valid email address Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.

He added, \"You have to remember the pundits and dynamos of the industry are traders.\n\"A lot gets lost in communication between that and the retail side of the industry.\"\nThere is definitely an argument to be made for having a slight overweight to cash when you start to feel wary on both sides of market, viewing both equities and bonds from a peak down. Nine to 12 months of cash reserve, rather than just six months, is the new norm for greater security, and to take some risk off the table and wait for a better opportunity to reinvest, he said.\nBoneparth also is favoring bond managers who use unconstrained total return approaches, the style employed by Gross and Gundlach, among others, to tactically allocate across the entire global fixed-income universe.\n\"Rates have been going up and look at yesterday,\" he said. \"I was looking at core bond funds to see if any total return funds were really rocked and the meter didn't move that much. Across the board, it didn't look too detrimental.\"\n\"A downtick in bonds is not same as a downtick in equities,\" said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial. He said even in previous rate increase environments, when bond income is received and reinvested, that can keep returns in positive territory and help investors get through fixed-income volatility. \"Maybe it is the end of a 30-year bull run in bonds, but I still think if rates rise gradually, most diversified fixed income portfolios should fair OK.\"\nBoneparth has no concerns about sticking with bonds for the long-term and doesn't believe clients will, either. \"No matter how tactical you are trying to be with bonds they will still make up a big swath of allocation models, the majority in pre-retiree and retiree accounts,\" he said. \"What can they do? Load up even more on equities?\n\"Let's assume a correction, 20 percent down, and then making claim bonds are a bad investment?\" Boneparth added. \"How will they feel then when there is obviously a flight to safety? \n\"You can't bail on an asset class ... even if turns out to be a bad cycle for bonds, when the good cycle returns, I'll still have all my clients.\""}
{"published":"2018-01-09T21:58:00.000+02:00","title":"How to know whether your business qualifies for that 20 percent tax break","text":"SHARES Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images President Donald Trump speaks about the passage of tax reform legislation on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC, December 20, 2017. \nSmall business owners may benefit from kinder tax treatment under the new law. They should think twice before becoming incorporated. \nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act offers a 20 percent deduction for qualified business income from so-called pass-through entities, which include S corporations and limited liability companies. \nUnder the \"old\" tax code, income from these small businesses would \"pass-through\" to the owner on her own taxes and were subject to individual income tax rates as high as 39.6 percent. \nNow, entrepreneurs are subject to a tax break on the income their businesses generate, but many of them face a key decision: Is it now time to incorporate \u2014 and if so, what entity should you choose? \n\"Everyone wants to form an LLC,\" said Sepi Ghiasvand, who is of counsel at Hopkins Carley in Palo Alto, California. \"This is a time when an LLC can save you on taxes, but with a caveat.\" \nHere are the things to consider before incorporating your business . Not a free-for-all \nThe new tax law's 20 percent deduction on qualified business income is subject to limitations that keep it from being a free-for-all for every entrepreneur. \nIn general, to qualify for the full deduction, your taxable income must be below $157,500 if you're single or $315,000 if you're married and file jointly. \nFilers who are below those thresholds may take the deduction no matter what business they're in, said Jeffrey Levine, a certified public accountant and director of financial planning at BluePrint Wealth Alliance in Garden City, New York. \"We've seen plaintiffs' counsel pierce the corporate veil because business owners treat the corporation as a piggy bank and don't maintain bylaws\" -Rick Keller, chairman of First Foundation \nHowever, once taxable income exceeds those thresholds, the law places limits on who can take the break. For instance, entrepreneurs with service businesses \u2014 including doctors, lawyers and financial advisors \u2014 may not be able to take advantage of the deduction if their income is too high. \nFinally, partners in a business may also find themselves in a situation in which one owner gets the 20 percent deduction and the other doesn't. That's because a partner with a high-income spouse may wind up exceeding the taxable income threshold. \n\"What's fascinating is that you can have two people doing the same work for the same pay, but only one can take the deduction on their return because of other factors,\" said Levine. How it works \nThe 20 percent deduction is considered a \"between the lines\" deduction in that it doesn't lower your adjusted gross income and you don't have to itemize on your taxes in order to take it. \nGenerally, if you qualify for the deduction, the 20 percent break will apply to the lesser of your qualified business income or your taxable income minus capital gains. See below for an example from Levine of BluePrint Wealth Alliance. \nKey Facts: Joint filer with a Schedule C business has a standard deduction of $24,000Business gross income of $130,000Business expenses of $30,000Net profit from business $100,000 (qualified business income)Spouse works and makes $70,000Above-the-line deductions of $7,500 for deductible portion of self-employment tax and $20,000 for SEP IRA contribution Analysis: Taxable income before application of pass-through deduction = $118,500In this case, the taxable income of $118,500 is greater than the qualified business income of $100,000. As a result, the 20 percent pass through deduction will apply to the qualified business income, resulting in a $20,000 deduction.This couple is in the 22 percent tax bracket, so they save about $4,400 in federal taxes. LLC formation \nOne big advantage in establishing an LLC is the fact that it protects owners from having their personal assets seized by the business's creditors. \nSetting up your LLC may cost a couple hundred to a couple thousand dollars, and you'll be required to file your documents with the state in which your business is based. \nYou will have to tell the IRS how it should tax your business, using Form 8832 : Is your business a corporation, a partnership or should it be on your personal tax return? \nWhat you choose matters, and here's why. Hero Images | Getty Images Social Security \nEntrepreneurs must pay self-employment taxes, which include payments toward Social Security, of 15.3 percent. However, profits that pass through from an S-corp. are subject only to income taxes. \nIn that case, an owner of an S-corp. would pay the self-employment tax from his salary, instead. Compliance requirements \nIn order to maintain their liability protection and preferred tax status, owners of S-corps. (and C-corps.) need to have an operating agreement in place, maintain books and records, and track their minutes. \n\"We've seen plaintiffs' counsel pierce the corporate veil because business owners treat the corporation as a piggy bank and don't maintain bylaws,\" said Rick Keller, chairman of First Foundation in Irvine, California. Consistent profits \nOnce your business consistently exceeds $70,000 in annual profits after expenses from 1099 income (as opposed to W-2 wages), it might be time to consider setting up an S-corp., according to Howard Samuels, a CPA and managing partner at Samuels & Associates in Florham Park, New Jersey. \nThat's because S-corps. are subject to bookkeeping requirements: Owners need to file returns for themselves and the business. They also need payroll services to ensure that taxes are correctly deducted. \nOwners should weigh how much they will save on taxes with an S-corp. versus how much they will pay to set it up and maintain it. \nWatch: Here's what Trump will discuss in his first major speech since tax overhaul passed show chapters"}

Morgan 's international chairman. \nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Jacob Frenkel said: \"My main concern is problems arise, always, when you are overly optimistic (and) when you take too much debt.\"\"This was the main lessons from all the previous crises,\" he added. The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) upwardly revised its global growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 on Monday, saying the revision is partly down to the recently approved overhaul of the U.S. tax system under President Donald Trump . Global growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have both been revised upward by 0.2 percentage points to 3.9 percent.Frenkel said that an apparent air of optimism among global business and political leaders attending Davos this year was \"justified\" because the economic performance of each and every region of the world was better than the previous year. 'Rapid rise in debt' is reason for concern, Frenkel says \nNonetheless, the somewhat rosy economic outlook was also reason to be concerned.J.P. Morgan's Frenkel argued the main challenge was to ensure improving economies worldwide \"grounded\" their growth by building on real investment activities and not just by increasing debt.\"Because increasing debt is based on the assumption that you will be able to pay it, that you may be able to refinance it, that interest rates will stay low and all of these assumptions need to be tested.\" Global debt levels skyrocketed to a record high of $233 trillion in the third quarter of 2017, according to the Institute of International Finance. The Washington D.C.-based financial industry body said at the start of 2018 that total debt had risen by $16 trillion in the third quarter when compared to year-end of 2016.When asked what he perceived to be the most pressing concern for the global economy, Frenkel replied: \"A rapid rise in debt \u2014 in corporate, household, governments and the like. But I don't want to be misinterpreted, I am optimistic about the state of the world economy.\"Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .

(PURO) Provides Corporate Update on Recent Restructuring and Closes on Merger","text":"FREDERICKSBURG, VA, Jan. 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nPurio, Inc. (OTC PINK: PURO) announced today that it has supplied all required filings to obtain current status with OTC Markets and provide updates on recent restructuring. In addition, the company has closed on its first merger with BitFrontier Capital Investments, Inc. and is in negotiations for substantial funding, which will allow the company to implement its cryptocurrency mining business plan aggressively and in a time efficient manner. The company also intends to appoint two more officers to the positions of COO and CTO. These two individuals have extensive knowledge of this industry, and will manage the company\u2019s cryptocurrency mining warehouse.\nThe Company is pleased to announce it has closed on its first merger with BitFrontier Capital Investments, Inc., which was posted on OTC Markets, and officially uploaded to the Wyoming Secretary of State's website. We are in the final stages of closing on our second merger with BitFrontier Technologies, Inc., and will upload the necessary documents to OTC Markets once the transaction is finalized. Once finalized, BitFrontier Capital Holdings, Inc. (F\/K\/A Purio, Inc.) will operate two wholly-owned subsidiaries, BitFrontier Capital Investments, Inc. and BitFrontier Technologies, Inc.\nBitFrontier Technologies will primarily engage in cryptocurrency mining with a focus on Bitcoin mining, and intends to have its first facility open mid 2018. We plan to deploy an array of both ASIC and GPU miners. These miners will position the company to mine the cryptocurrencies with the greatest profitability, and minimize the downtime when switching servers to other algorithms that are used to mine different cryptocurrencies. Once our first warehouse is built, we also plan to implement a strategic model where we can host outside miners owned by either individuals or other companies and take a management\/hosting fee from each outside miner we host. Providing this service will allow the company to become a leader in the cryptocurrency space, as many companies are interested in entering this industry, but don't actually have the resources or knowledge to deploy and maintain the necessary servers and mining equipment. The Company will go into greater detail when it releases its 2018 road map, which will establish a timeline for when our first facility will be up and running. This road map will also outline how many miners we are able to host per warehouse, as well as the hashing power and electrical consumption per facility.\nBitFrontier Capital Investments will focus on investment opportunities in both public and private blockchain related companies through the use of convertible debentures, joint ventures, or other strategic direct investments. This will allow the Company to align itself alongside innovative blockchain-related software companies and provide an array of business opportunities.\nRestructuring Highlights:\n1. The Company has no intentions to implement a Reverse Stock Split now, or in the foreseeable future.\n2. The Company recently reduced its authorized capital stock by over 32 billion shares, and is exploring options to reduce it further.\n3. The Company is currently working on ways to improve its current share structure, including an administrative stop order placed on the 12,000,127,987 shares of Common Stock held by previous officers and control persons. The Company is currently working with its security counsel to verify the issuance of such shares and obtain documentation related to these shares. If documentation satisfactory to the Company and its security counsel is not supplied, or if the Company determines these shares were issued illegally, the shares will be canceled. We intend to provide further updates as they become available in the near future on the status of these shares.\n4. The Preferred Stock Series A and Series B of the Company has been amended to convert on a 1 for 1 basis with approximately 14 Million shares currently outstanding. An administrative stop order has been placed on all Preferred Shares from previous management while the Company works with its security counsel to verify the issuance of such shares and obtain documentation on its issuance. The Preferred Shares were issued in the same series of transactions as the Common Stock discussed in item 3 above, and is currently being investigated in conjunction with the Common Stock by the Company and its security counsel.\n5. The Company has been informed by its new transfer agent Pacific Stock Transfer, that it has received all required documents from our previous transfer agent and is now the official transfer agent for the company. Shareholders can verify all share structure related information whenever they deem necessary from our OTC Markets page, or directly with the transfer agent at info@pacificstocktransfer.com or by calling Pacific Stock Transfer at 800-785-7782.\n6. The Company has received the new CUSIP number from its transfer agent and filed an issuer notification form with FINRA on January 2nd to complete the name change from Purio, Inc. to BitFrontier Capital Holdings, Inc. and change the ticker from PURO to BITF, or if not available BTCF to better reflect the Company's business plan. The anticipated effective date for both actions is tentatively set for January 12th, 2018 but is subject to FINRA approval.\nAdditionally, the company has been working with several large funds to obtain the necessary funding for the complete build-out of the cryptocurrency mining operations, which will be beneficial to both the company and shareholders. Once the company has formally signed the funding agreement, we will release a joint PR and intend to be able to provide an update on funding later this week.\nAdditional information about BitFrontier Capital Holdings will be available soon on the Company's website at https:\/\/bitfrontiercapitalholdings.com and current updates are posted regularly on Twitter at https:\/\/twitter.com\/BitFrontierInc .\nAbout BitFrontier Capital Holdings, Inc. (F\/K\/A Purio, Inc.)\nBitFrontier Capital Holdings is a blockchain-oriented company focused on the cryptocurrency markets. We plan on expanding operations in the Bitcoin mining industry and see great potential in this rapidly expanding sector. Bitcoin mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, known as the blockchain, and also the means through which new Bitcoins are released.\nNOTES ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nExcept for any historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this press release contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including those described in the Company's reports and filings at http:\/\/otcmarkets.com .\nCertain statements contained in this release that are not historical facts constitute forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by that Act.

{"published":"2018-01-04T23:38:00.000+02:00","title":"Fox executives: scripted series will survive Disney deal","text":"PASADENA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Fox broadcasting network, home to \"The Simpsons\" and \"The Orville,\" will continue to air scripted entertainment after the Fox TV studio's sale to Disney, Fox executives said Thursday.\nThe pending deal that will separate the Fox network and 20th Century Fox studio won't turn the network into a platform solely for sports and other live programming, Fox Television Group chairmen Dana Walden and Gary Newman told TV critics Thursday.\nSpeculation about the network's future arose after Fox founder Rupert Murdoch talked about so-called \"New Fox\" as an entity for news and sports. But he was referring to the company overall and not specifically the broadcast network, the executives said.\nShows on Fox will remain on Fox and there is no plan to move them to Disney-owned ABC, Walden said. While Fox will no longer have an in-house sister studio it will be able to take greater advantage of shows from outside producers, she and Newman said.\nThe executives declined to speculate about how they would be affected by the sale, saying they were focused on the work at hand.\n\"Whether we ultimately end up at Disney, stay at Fox or end up somewhere else,\" for the year or more it will take to close the sale they will remain at Fox overseeing the studio and network, Newman said.\nLast month, Disney announced it was buying a large part of the Murdoch family's 21st Century Fox for about $52.4 billion in stock, including FX Networks, film and TV studios and cable and international TV businesses. The deal doesn't include the Fox network and Fox-owned stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network.\nAddressing the sale as \"the elephant in the room or, in our case, the mouse,\" Newman said he expects it will pass regulatory muster in fairly quick fashion and that it will be business as usual for the next 12 to 18 months as the process plays out.\n\"I would be lying if I said there wasn't anxiety\" over the sale from those working with Fox, Newman said. But he said Disney executives are \"enormous fans of our brand\" and he predicted that the future bodes well for Fox's creative partners.\nAmong the more prominent is Ryan Murphy, who gave Fox the series \"Glee\" and newcomer \"9-1-1\" and is a hitmaker of edgy fare (\"American Horror Story,\" ''American Crime Story\") for the FX Networks.\nIn a call with Disney CEO Robert Iger following the deal, \"I said point blank the stuff I do is not specifically Disney,\" Murphy said of the company with a family-friendly image. \"I'm concerned about that. Am I going to have to put Mickey Mouse in 'American Horror Story,'\" he recalled asking Iger.\nThe Disney chief reassured him that wasn't the case and that it was buying Fox because it believed in its creators and assets, Murphy said. While he said he's taking heart from how companies such as Pixar and Marvel have fared as part of Disney, the producer said he'll see how things pan out before making any decisions.\nIn a separate Q&A with critics, producer Seth MacFarlane (\"The Orville,\" ''Family Guy\") said he received a similar call from Iger.\nWith the deal, Disney aims to better compete with streaming services including Netflix and Amazon that are eating into the traditional TV model. By taking over Fox properties including the Avatar movies, \"The Simpsons\" and Marvel characters such as X-Men and The Avengers, Disney will have a well-stocked larder when it launches ESPN- and Disney-branded streaming services in the coming years.\nWalden said she was initially \"shocked\" by news of the deal, but that quickly turned to optimism.\nShe has a \"very clear view of what kind of opportunity this is and how protective the Murdochs were about making a decision about Disney when they had another companies courting them,\" she said."}

The technology could ultimately help Microsoft pick up more Azure revenue by serving customers who want to use cloud computing while still keeping data in their own facilities. \nTerms of the deal weren't disclosed. \nAvere offers hardware for storing data in data centers, but the acquisition seems more about strengthening and increasing the use of Microsoft's Azure public cloud. The technology lets companies use remote computing resources while keeping their data in place, and it can ease the migration of data to public clouds as well. \nAvere offers tools for working with Microsoft's top two cloud competitors, Amazon Web Services and the Google Cloud Platform. Avere said it would bring its tools to Azure in 2015, but today the company's website primarily advertises its integrations with the Amazon and Google clouds. \n\"We are excited to welcome Avere to Microsoft, and look forward to the impact their technology and the team will have on Azure and the customer experience,\" Jason Zander, corporate vice president of Azure at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post . \nOverall, Microsoft has taken more of a hybrid approach than Amazon or Google in the cloud business. It offers the Azure Stack private cloud software that mirrors what's available from the Azure public cloud. And Microsoft continues to sell server and database software for corporate data centers. \n\"Over the years, Microsoft has made significant investments to provide its customers with the most flexible, secure and scalable storage solutions in the marketplace and has made Azure the natural home for enterprise applications. This shared focus on large enterprise applications makes Microsoft a great fit for Avere,\" Avere CEO Ron Bianchini, a former vice president of storage hardware company NetApp , wrote in a blog post. \nGoogle, the main business unit of Alphabet, made a rare direct investment in Avere last year. (Most Alphabet investments come through its venture arms.) Other investors include Western Digital Capital, Menlo Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Tenaya Capital. In total Avere raised $97 million. \nAvere was founded in 2008 and is based in Pittsburgh. Its customers include Johns Hopkins University, Sony Pictures' Imageworks and the Library of Congress.

At least two people were killed.\nSome legislators opposed to the law tried unsuccessfully at various stages to filibuster it and some were suspended from proceedings. During the final debate on the amendment last month, some lawmakers scuffled with police.\nMuseveni is the latest of a growing list of African leaders who have either changed the law or used other tactics to thwart opponents and hold onto power long after their tenure has ended.\nIn Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan, such moves have provoked instability.\nLast month\u2019s vote by parliament was the second time the Ugandan legislature has amended the constitution to allow Museveni to stay in power. In 2005 they voted to remove a limit of two five-year terms, which had blocked him from standing again.\nDespite the growing cries of autocracy against Museveni, Washington has backed him as a strongman who has turned Uganda into a bulwark of stability in Africa\u2019s troubled Great Lakes region.\nThe landlocked East African country is eyeing commencement of crude production in 2020 and the construction of a pipeline to export it via neighboring Tanzania is underway.\nReporting by Elias Biryabarema; Editing by Maggie Fick and Gareth Jones\n "}

Its chairman briefly took the reins then also stepped down.\n\u201cWhile the Group has achieved some degree of stabilization in its operating businesses, significant near-term liquidity is still required in certain of the business units,\u201d Steinhoff said on Thursday.\nChief financial officer Ben la Grange, whom the company has cleared of any wrongdoing, will leave his position and Philip Dieperink, the finance chief of Steinhoff\u2019s UK business, will become acting CFO.\nThe company said la Grange would concentrate on \u201cthe preservation and procurement of liquidity in the group\u201d and finalizing its 2017 accounts.\nTurnaround specialist AlixPartners was called in last month to help shore up finances as lenders have started restricting access to credit lines and insurers are cancelling or reducing credit insurance.\nSteinhoff, which has debts of around 10.7 billion euros, said it planned to hire a debt restructuring expert in the role of chief restructuring officer.\nEarlier this week, Steinhoff said it would have to restate its 2015 accounts and maybe even earlier figures, having already warned on its 2016 numbers.\nSHARES REBOUND More than $10 billion has been wiped off Steinhoff\u2019s market value following the disclosure of the scandal that has claimed the heads of CEO Markus Jooste and chairman Christo Wiese. They were key figures who transformed Steinhoff from a modest furniture distributor to a global household goods giant.\nShares in Steinhoff, still down about 80 percent from a month ago, rebounded more than 25 percent on Thursday to 8.60 rand.\nThis week UK subsidiary Poundland reported strong Christmas trading and European unit, Pepkor Europe, which houses Poundland and Dealz, said it had replaced planned investment from its parent in full with a new independent 180 million pound loan.\nMeanwhile, the company\u2019s Asia Pacific subsidiary has hired lawyers and a restructuring specialist to advise on the \u201csignificant uncertainty\u201d facing its parent.\nSteinhoff has so far raised around $400 million from the sale of a portion of its stake in South African investment heavyweight PSG Group ( PSGJ.J ).

Payment firms typically deposit them into bank accounts where they earn interest. \nInterest income earned on those reserve funds accounted for 11 percent of total income for internet-based payment companies, data from Zhongtai Securities shows. The latest hike in reserves will slash more than 4.48 billion yuan ($689 million) in annual interest earnings from the industry, according to Reuters calculations, under the assumption that payment companies could have earned 3 percent annualised interest rate on those funds. FILE PHOTO: An Alipay logo is seen at a cashier in Shanghai, China January 12, 2017. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo \nAnalysts say large, diversified firms such as Ant Financial and Tencent will be able to absorb the costs, and seek to replace revenue with income from other products, including wealth management tools and micro-loans. \nThe move puts extra pressure on the two top firms, however, who are facing barriers at home and abroad as regulators balk at the technical and financial implications of their rapid expansion. \nAnt Financial on Wednesday announced it has withdrawn a $1.2 billion acquisition bid for U.S. money transfer firm Moneygram International Inc after U.S. government panel rejected the bid over national security concerns. \nAnt Financial said it was supportive of the PBOC\u2019s move. Tencent did not respond to a request for comment. Slideshow (2 Images) \nSmaller payment firms could face consolidation as their margins slide. There are currently more than 200 companies licensed to provide such services. \nShanghai-based All In Pay Network Service, which has 1.7 million merchants, said it would adjust its business to comply with the central bank\u2019s new policy. \n\u201cIn terms of the actual impact it will have on our company, that still remains to be seen,\u201d it said. GREATER REGULATORY OVERSIGHT \nThe move will allow China\u2019s central bank to gain more insight into capital flows within the industry as it seeks to quell financial risks associated with the massive funds now kept by third-party payment companies. \nThe rules on reserve funds also pave the way for the establishment of a new government-directed clearing house for third-party payment companies, which is expected to launch in June. The new entity will enable the central bank to track all online financial transaction data and the flow of funds in the industry, analysts say. \nIn August, the regulator instructed third-party payment firms to route all of their transactions through the centralised clearing house, in which its affiliated companies own largest stakes. \nIn addition to new rules on reserve funds and clearing, last week the PBOC also announced plans to cap barcode payments to as low as 500 yuan to rein in risks arising from the popular service. \n\u201cPreventing risks remains the core theme in 2018,\u201d CITIC Securities said in a research note. \u201cPayment giants are likely to slow down their aggressive marketing deployed in the early stages of development and pay more attention to compliance.\u201d Additional Reporting by SHANGHAI Newsroom; Editing by Lincoln Feast"}

They found that kids who saw their grandparents at least weekly and described these interactions as happy were much less likely to express ageist views. \n\u201cPrevious research had suggested that frequency of contacts with the elderly (time spent together) had no effect on children\u2019s attitudes towards older people, whereas a high quality of contact positively influenced these attitudes,\u201d said lead study author Allison Flamion of the University of Liege. \nBut most of this research was done in university students, not in children and teens, Flamion said by email. \n\u201cThe children in our study described their relationship with their grandparents very openly, as they perceived it,\u201d Flamion said. \u201cWe were somewhat surprised to find such a strong correlation between the children\u2019s perception of grandparents\u2019 contacts and the ageist stereotypes turning up in the questionnaires.\u201d \nIn questionnaires, the researchers asked the youths about the health of their own grandparents, how often the two generations met and how the young people felt about their relationships with their grandparents. \nIn general, views on the elderly expressed by the children and adolescents were neutral or positive. \nGirls had slightly more positive views than boys, and girls also tended to view their own aging more favorably, the researchers report in Child Development. \nAgeist stereotypes appeared to change at various points in childhood, the study also found. \nThe youngest children, from 7 to 9 years old, expressed the most prejudice and kids from 10 to 12 years old had the most acceptance and tolerance. \nTeenagers had more prejudiced notions about aging than pre-teens, but not as much as the youngest children in the study. \nGrandparents\u2019 health may also influence how children think about aging, the study suggests. \nYoung people with grandparents in poor health were more likely to believe negative stereotypes about the elderly than children and teens with healthier grandparents. \nThe study wasn\u2019t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how time with grandparents might impact children\u2019s views on aging. \nEven so, the current study offers fresh evidence that both the frequency and quality of contact with grandparents matters in shaping how children think about age, said Tara Lineweaver, a psychology researcher at Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \n\u201cThe quality of the time children spent with their grandparents mattered most when they also spent more time with their grandparents,\u201d Lineweaver said by email. \n\u201cWhat I found most valuable and most surprising about their results is that the influence of quality interactions with grandparents was greatest in middle childhood (ages 10-12), when attitudes are already most positive, suggesting that good relationships with grandparents may help explain the positive beliefs about aging that typically accompany this stage of development,\u201d Lineweaver added. \nGrowing evidence also suggests that contact between grandchildren and grandparents can be good for both, said Dominic Abrams, a psychology researcher at the University of Kent, in the UK. \n\u201cMore time that is enjoyable and positive really makes the biggest difference. I think there are several ways that this works,\u201d Abrams, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \n\u201cFrom a strong positive relationship they are more likely to learn things about older people that they might not otherwise have discovered such as their strengths, abilities, breadth of experience, and that they have a range of emotions and knowledge,\u201d Abrams added. \u201cSecond, they may meet other older people whilst with their grandparents, giving them greater awareness of other older people in general and making ageing and oldness less strange and perhaps less frightening to the extent that grandparents are able to explain and share their experiences.\u201d \nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2CREe9S Child Development, online December 19, 2017."}

But while Iceland's government has made a concerted effort to ensure pay equity, efforts have stalled in other developed nations, including the United States.\nIceland's law stands out in a key way: Companies and organizations with at least 25 full-time employees must actually obtain government certification proving their pay policies are based on factors such as education, skills and performance, not gender. If not, they risk a fine of around $500 each day they are out of compliance. \nThe demands made by America's laws aren't as rigorous, and that may be in part because the people making, enforcing and implementing the laws are still largely men, suggests Jill Gonzalez, an analyst at financial website WalletHub . \"The pay gap still persists because women continue to have disproportionate representation in both corporate leadership positions, as well as political ones,\" she tells CNBC Make It .\nThe Center for American Women and Politics reports that women make up less than 20 percent of the U.S. Congress. At the same time, Reuters notes , nearly 50 percent of Iceland's parliament, where the first-of-its-kind pay law was approved, is made up of women.\nThe Equal Pay Act , first passed by Congress in 1963, mandated that men and women be given equal pay for equal work, and, some states, like Minnesota, have equal-salary policies . But legislation in America has not been very effective: Women, on average, are still paid 20 percent less than men.\nshow chapters Adam Grant bashes viral google memo, saying the differences between men and women are slim to none      12:54 PM ET Tue, 8 Aug 2017 | 01:00 A recent report from the Pew Research Center, conducted before 2017's wave of sexual misconduct allegations , notes that employed women are five times more likely than employed men to say they've earned less for doing the same job. \nEven education level doesn't reduce pay disparity much, according to Pew data . Working women with a bachelor's degree or higher level of education were more likely than those with less education to say they've earned less than a man who performed the same job.\nThe same is true for women with higher incomes: 30 percent of women with family incomes of $100,000 or more report they've earned less than a man who was doing comparable work, Pew notes, compared with roughly one-in-five women with lower incomes.\nIn popular, high-paying industries like tech , women are offered lower starting salaries than their male counterparts for the same job at the same company 63 percent of the time.\n\"The pay gap still persists because women continue to have disproportionate representation in both corporate leadership positions, as well as political ones.\" -Jill Gonzalez, WalletHub analyst  Reasons for the disparities could include an \"unconscious bias during the interview process that determine a candidate's salary based on what he or she was previously making, rather than the market rate for that individual's skills and years of experience,\" one study notes.\nSusan Vitale, chief marketing officer at tech company iCIMS , agrees. \"Past inequality begets future inequality,\" she tells CNBC Make It, citing the company's Women in the Workforce report . \"It's extremely common for employers to ask candidates their salary history instead of, or in addition to, their salary expectations or requirements.\n\"If women were previously underpaid,\" she says, \"sharing their salary history may impact a future offer, compounding the issue.\" While this practice was recently banned in some states , \"women have been adversely affected by the question for years.\"\nSome experts predict women in the United States won't reach pay equity with men until 2119.

' This vague language makes it difficult for women to prove they were paid less than a male counterpart because of their gender and deters many from even filing a lawsuit.\"\nBy putting a more aggressive law into place, Iceland hopes to make change and set an example for countries. Not everyone there, however, is on board. Some employers' associations say the law \"imposes costly compliance burdens and involves too much government interference in the labor market,\" reports the Associated Press .\nAnd, as Kelli Dragovich, a senior vice president at career website Hired , whose company has \"made it a priority\" to close the pay gap, tells CNBC Make It, while Iceland's law \"comes from a phenomenal place,\" it may have some unintended consequences.\n\"Just because a man and a women have the same job title, does not mean they perform at the same level. A person's years of experience, education, location and performance all contribute to their salary,\" she says, \"and none of these attributes are correlated with gender.\"\nThe chances of something like Iceland's law being passed in the U.S. these days are quite slim, though business and political leaders like Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, and California Senator Kamala Harris are ramping up their efforts to achieve pay equity in America. And some organizations around the country are following suit, pushing for legislation like the Paycheck Fairness Act .\nStill, Don Schroeder, partner at the law firm Foley and Lardner , says there is a long way to go.\nEfforts such as fighting for new legislation and performing pay-equity assessments using external data and audits \"will likely close the pay gap,\" he tells CNBC Make It, \"but certainly not as quickly as wide-sweeping legislation like Iceland's new equity law.\"\nLike this story?

Over the past six months, WTI has soared by 36 percent while Brent has surged by 41 percent. \n\"These [prices] are probably $5 to $10 a barrel higher than what you'll see for the average of the year \u2014 maybe more. And, I would suspect we'd see prices drop by the time the Oscars replace the Golden Globes,\" he said, referring to March. \nAccording to Kloza, the Street is seeing billions of dollars of new money coming into passive and active investments mostly in oil positions right now. He says this type of activity typically happens in the beginning of January. \nPlus, he contends that U.S. crude oil inventories always drop in the final few weeks of a year, noting that late 2017 saw its highest U.S. refinery runs by far. Kloza says oil companies have been holding off importing crude as part of tax avoidance strategies. \nBut all that is expected to change. \n\"We probably have about $10 downside at least in Brent, and maybe a little bit less than that in WTI,\" he said. \nUltimately, he predicts both WTI and Brent prices will average in the $50 range this year with the biggest drop likely happening toward spring \u2014 unless there's an event such as an Iranian revolution or intensifying turmoil in Venezuela. Rising heating bills? \nBut there is one area of the energy space that may not get cheaper anytime soon. \nKloza predicts heating oil will rise sharply mostly due to the cold snap gripping much of the nation. \n\"Consumers would get their highest heating oil bills since the polar vortex winter of 2013-2014,\" he warned in a special note to CNBC. \nWith wholesale heating oil prices around $2 a gallon, Kloza predicts they could push to the $3 a gallon level \u2014 about a 40 percent increase. Prices are already up 9 percent in just the past four weeks. \n\"Some homeowners commonly use 800-1000 gallons in a cold winter. That translates into a seasonal bill of say $2400-$3000 in some areas [like New England] where recent mild winters probably cost only $1800-$2400,\" Kloza wrote."}

The trading floor is seen on the final day of trading for the year at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in Manhattan, New York, U.S., December 29, 2017. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly 1\/ PARTY ON \nWorld stocks started the year with their best week in over a year and while it\u2019s tempting to say \u201csame old, same old\u201d as markets smash another host of milestones and records, you still have to take a step back and assess what\u2019s happening. \nThere are some who will dismiss this as another bout of mindless bubble blowing and insist it will all end in tears. Perhaps it will. But the more sober assessment is that we are going through the first boom in the world economy in over a decade. \nGlobal industrial output raced higher at more than a 5 percent annualised rate last month and more than 4 percent for the fourth quarter as a whole. The G10 economic surprise index \u2013 which nets positive over negative hits and misses on incoming data \u2013 continues to hover close to its most positive readings in almost 8 years. \nThere will be harder data on industrial output for Q4 next week, as well as trade data readings from China and tech soundings in Asia from the likes of Samsung. Inflation-focused central banks that have fuelled all this with their record cheap money will be looking at the rising price of oil meanwhile. 2\/ YEARNING FOR EARNINGS \nPerhaps one reason for the latest run up in stocks, the Q4 earnings season, comes back onto the radar, with the big U.S. financials kicking off at the end of the week. \nJPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) and rival Wells Fargo ( WFC.N ) launch the earnings season with reports before the opening bell on Friday. Even despite the record low financial market volatility that\u2019s crimping trading revenues, deal making has been super brisk over recent months and overall fee income from banks around the world rose some 16 percent last year to a record level of more than $100 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. The numbers should be good. Blended year-on-year Q4 earnings growth for the S&P 500 overall is expected to be 11.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S estimates, up from 8.5 percent in Q3. Excluding the energy sector, which benefits from weak year-earlier comparisons, it is seen at 9.5 percent. Data which runs since 1994 shows that in a typical quarter 64 percent of companies beat estimates and 21 percent miss estimates. Over the past four quarters, however, 72 percent have beaten the Street estimates and only 19 percent have missed them. 3\/ SOLVING A PROBLEM LIKE KOREA? \nOfficials from North and South Korea will meet on Tuesday for their first official talks in more than two years. \nAgreeing to the meeting represents a turnaround by Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime, which has focussed in the past 12 months on developing its nuclear arsenal amid bellicose exchanges with U.S. President Donald Trump, raising alarm across the world. \nThe meeting is expected to focus on the North potentially sending athletes to the Winter Olympics to be held in the South in February as well as on some other inter-Korean relations, according to Seoul. \nEvery word and gesture will be scrutinised by geopolitical analysts as they try to judge if this really is a re-emerging detente between the two nations, not to mention the reaction from Trump\u2019s twitter account. 4\/BOOM BOOM, AND? \nA blizzard of data is expected to show China\u2019s economy ended a strong 2017 on a slightly softer note. However, activity has remained more resilient than expected despite a crackdown on industrial pollution, overzealous lending and a cooling property market. \nThe week kicks off with forex reserves data and a bunch of inflation numbers, before the focus will switch to trade figures out on Friday. Exports are expected to have jumped more than 9 percent in December after soaring unexpectedly 12.3 percent in November thanks to sustained strength in global demand. \nA slight pullback in December industrial growth, producer inflation and investment would all reinforce consensus views that the world\u2019s second-largest economy will slow only marginally in 2018. A more marked loss of momentum may put fears of a sharper slowdown back on the table, unsettle the yuan and possibly stall the government\u2019s push to reduce rising debt. 5\/HELLAS ANGEL \nIt may be the depths of winter with storms tearing across the euro zone, but the political and economic skies are almost cloudless all of a sudden. \nOn Sunday, Angela Merkel will begin trying to re-form a \u2018grand coalition\u2019, an effort that could rumble on for a few months, and campaigning for Italy\u2019s uncertain election in March is also getting underway, but the rest of the bloc looks buoyant. \nPerhaps the most eye-catching thing is that crisis posterchild Greece\u2019s borrowing costs hit their lowest in 12 years on Friday on expectations that the country could conclude its euro zone\/IMF bailout package later this year. \nThat would cap a slowly strengthening recovery eight years after Greece lurched on the brink of defaulting on its debt and risked being kicked out of the single currency bloc.

Ackman and members of the Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. advisory board and senior management (together with Mr. Ackman, the \u201cPSCM Management Team\u201d). Selling PSH\u2019s common stock in HHC will provide more flexibility under the \"United States real property holding company\" rules pursuant to the FIRPTA provisions in the Internal Revenue Code as further described below.\nIn addition to the sale of PSH\u2019s stake in HHC, an affiliated fund, Pershing Square, L.P. (\u201cPSLP\u201d), will participate in the offering by selling 432,510 shares of common stock in HHC. PSLP is selling the Common Stock for portfolio management reasons. An aggregate of 2,500,000 shares of HHC common stock is expected to be sold in the offering. After the proposed sale, funds managed by Pershing Square Capital Management L.P. will beneficially own 5.1% of HHC common stock and will retain an additional 12.5% economic exposure to HHC through the ownership of total return swaps, for a total of 17.6% economic exposure to HHC.\nHHC has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) and will file a preliminary prospectus supplement with the SEC for this offering of HHC common stock.

In addition, the PSCM Management Team believes that the Potential Tender should assist in reducing the discount to net asset value at which PSH\u2019s public shares currently trade. The board of PSH is supportive of the Potential Tender but will make no recommendation as to whether individual holders of PSH\u2019s public shares should participate in the Potential Tender.\nThe specific terms of the Potential Tender will be made available by PSCM Acquisition Co LLC after the settlement of the HHC sale. It is anticipated that the Potential Tender will be for up to USD300,000,000 in value of PSH\u2019s public shares.\nIn accordance with EU law, PSH is suspending its current share purchase program with immediate effect until the conclusion of the Potential Tender.\nPSH and PSCM Acquisition Co LLC hereby confirm that they have reached conditional agreement on the terms of the Potential Tender, subject to the conditions described herein.\nIf PSH\u2019s HHC sale is completed, PSH anticipates that, on the basis of certain representations and undertakings by the PSCM Management Team, PSH\u2019s board of directors may grant an exemption to the PSCM Management Team in respect of PSH\u2019s public shares acquired in the Potential Tender from the limit contained in PSH's articles of incorporation that no person may own or be treated as owning, within the meaning of Section 318 of the US Internal Revenue Code (as modified by Section 897(c)(6)(C) of the US Internal Revenue Code) PSH\u2019s public shares in excess of 4.99% of the value of PSH\u2019s public shares (which is referred to in PSH\u2019s articles of incorporation as the \"Ownership Limit\"). Accordingly, if such exemption is granted, the Ownership Limit shall not apply in respect of PSH public shares acquired by the PSCM Management Team in the Potential Tender. The Ownership Limit is in place because of tax issues relating to the \"United States real property holding company\" rules under the FIRPTA provisions in the Internal Revenue Code.\nThe PSCM Management Team will finance the Potential Tender through available cash and committed financing. The PSCM Management Team has no reason to believe that it will not be able to fund its obligations to purchase PSH public shares in the Potential Tender and pay the fees and expenses associated with the Potential Tender.\nPSH is not party to, or responsible for any aspect of, the Potential Tender. Launch of the Potential Tender, if and when made, and its specific timing is subject to the receipt of certain approvals from the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financi\u00eble Markten, \u201cAFM\u201d) and the UK Takeover Panel.\nAbout Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd.\nPershing Square Holdings, Ltd.

And for Republicans, the move toward the center guarantees getting primaried by a Republican challenger, a Breitbart type or so forth.\"\nshow chapters Michael Wolff's tell-all book won't really change Trump's agenda: Pro 12 Hours Ago | 03:59 In December, many congressional Republicans excoriated Breitbart Executive Chairman Bannon after his fielding of right-wing anti-establishment Senate candidate Roy Moore in Alabama \u2014 who beat Republican incumbent Luther Strange in the primaries \u2014 led to a victory for the Democratic contender Doug Jones .\nStill, winning any majority for the Democrats will not be easy. Although the party needs only two more seats for control of the Senate, 23 of the 33 senators up for re-election are Democrats, making them vulnerable. Two are independents who caucus with the Democrats, and only eight are Republicans.\nAdditionally, Republican leadership in Congress may welcome the split, as it could give them an opportunity to steer Trump in a direction that is more favorable to their mainstream conservative agenda.\nThe spat between Trump and Bannon slashes an alliance that helped galvanize the president's Republican base during his election. Bannon was a staunch Trump backer from the early days of the campaign, and is credited with pushing ethno-nationalism and populism onto the forefront of national politics.\nSome observers, however, are questioning the veracity of Bannon's accusations in \"Fire and Fury,\" with many calling him an opportunist and a self-promoter, skeptical of how much stock to put in his words. Bannon may also try to make amends \u2014 on Wednesday night he praised Trump on his Breitbart radio show, calling him \"a great man.\""}

Morris 3:39 PM EST \nIn the past couple of years, it has occasionally been said that smartphone apps are dead, peaking, or not worth creating at all . But if you\u2019ve been holding on to that amazing app idea, all is not lost \u2013 according to a new report, app revenues on Apple\u2019s App Store and Google Play surged by a staggering 35% from 2016 to 2017, and new installs are up 13.5%. \nThe data insights firm Sensor Tower claims that worldwide mobile app revenue, including both Android and iPhone apps, totaled $58.6 billion in 2017. That total includes both paid downloads and in-app purchases, but not mobile commerce purchases such as GrubHub orders or Uber rides. In 2016, the same number, according to Sensor Tower, was $43.5 billion. \nThose numbers square with what we already know about 2016 App Store revenue, which were estimated at $28 billion by McQuarrie, based on Apple statements about developer earnings. Both Apple and Google keep 30% of most earnings through their app stores. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter. \nRevenue grew roughly evenly for Android and iPhone. But app downloads grew much faster for Android \u2013 16.7% \u2013 than for iPhone, at just 6.7%. According to Sensor Tower, that\u2019s because of Android\u2019s dominance in developing economies. \nThe steady growth in App Store revenue is great news for Apple, which increasingly relies on digital and service sales. iPhone sales plateaued for a time in early 2016, presaging market saturation for the devices that have made Apple a goliath. \nThe launch of the iPhone 8 this year has generally been regarded as a success, but some reports claim it undersold its predecessor , the iPhone 7, early on. That picture was complicated by the possibility that some buyers were waiting for the release of the ultra-premium iPhone X, but it nonetheless seems clear that, if it\u2019s going to keep shareholders happy, Apple needs all the Candy Crush dividends it can get.

Some felt that the projection of three rate hikes might prove too aggressive and prevent inflation from returning  \nOthers felt more hikes might be needed if any one of a number of risks materialized, including the possibility that inflation might suddenly begin rising at a much faster pace amid cuts in personal and business taxes.\nPrivate economists viewed the minutes as evidence that the pace of inflation will be a key factor determining the number of rate hikes in 2018.\n\"Inflation has become the most important economic variable steering the Fed's policy right now and market investors would be well-advised to watch the inflation statistics like a hawk,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.\nThe Fed officials who felt that the three hikes reflected in the Fed's median economic forecast might be too much were concerned that it could make it harder to achieve the Fed's inflation target.\nA \"few other participants\" were worried that three rate hikes this year might not be enough because \"continued low interest rates risked financial instability in the future\" or the possibility that the economy could start to overheat given that unemployment is already at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent and expected to decline further.\nThe minutes covered last month's discussion, which led to the central bank boosting its key policy rate for a third time in 2017, to a new but still-low range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent.\nThe minutes showed that the central bank is still committed to a \"gradual\" pace for future rate hikes, even though there is a dispute over whether that means another three hikes in 2018 or a \"somewhat faster\" pace.\nSome analysts have begun to boost their forecast for this year to show four rate hikes, up from three. They expect the economy to grow faster now that Congress has approved the biggest overhaul to the tax code in three decades.\nWhile the Trump administration believes its economic program of tax cuts and deregulation will boost economic growth in coming years to a sustained rate of 3 percent, the Fed's revised economic projections released last month are far less optimistic.\nThe Fed is projecting growth of 2.5 percent this year, up from a previous forecast of 2.1 percent. But it then foresees growth slowing to 2.1 percent in 2019 and 2 percent in 2020.\nThe Fed's next meeting on Jan. 30-31 will be the last meeting for Fed Chair Janet Yellen.

REUTERS\/Gonzalo Fuentes \nYears of tinkering under Philippe Saint-Andre and then Guy Noves, sacked last month, have plunged the previously flamboyant team into deep uncertainty. \nFrom the 2015 World Cup fiasco to successive Six Nations failures, France\u2019s reputation has been damaged, and with Argentina and England in their 2019 World Cup pool, a quarter-final appearance is not guaranteed. \nWhile England have been relatively stable with Ben Youngs starting at scrumhalf and George Ford at flyhalf, France have tried countless halfback pairings without achieving cohesion. \nBrunel, however, vowed to collaborate better with the Top 14 clubs to make sure only the fittest players are selected when France\u2019s Six Nations campaign starts at home against Ireland on Feb. 3. \nThe Top 14 coaches and the France staff gathered on Monday and both parties described the meeting as very productive. \n\u201cClubs have accepted that the France staff come and spend two or three days at the clubs,\u201d said Clermont coach Franck Azema. \nClub coaches will also be allowed to come to France training sessions. \u201cWe will talk about what we saw. It\u2019s good if you want to improve.

Brunel, who led Perpignan to the French title in 2009, believes that both the clubs and the national team will benefit from the collaboration. \n\u201cWe will immerse ourselves in the clubs to be in contact with the coaches,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThe idea is to work together, to share ideas and find solutions. We feel that there is a real desire to collaborate. We will try to help each other.\u201d \nAs a result, the summer physical preparation at the National Rugby Centre (CNR) in Marcoussis set up by Noves will be dropped and the clubs will be again in charge of getting the players into shape during the off season. \n\u201cThe clubs will be responsible for the physical preparation,\u201d Racing 92 coach Laurent Travers confirmed. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a good initiative.

The peso weakened significantly on Wednesday after a Reuters report said Canada increasingly believes that President Donald Trump will soon announce his intention to withdraw from NAFTA. The move would be a severe setback for Mexico's economy, which depends on exports to the United States. Mexican officials reiterated on Thursday that if Trump began the withdrawal process then Mexico would break off NAFTA negotiations, which are scheduled to resume in January. Mnuchin's comments did not appear have much impact on the Mexican currency, however, and it gained a wafer-thin 0.02 percent. \"This was not seen as a threat by market participants,\" Banco Base's Gabriela Siller wrote in a report. Except for Argentina's peso, all other major Latin American currencies also rose. Mexico's benchmark S&P\/BMV IPC index remained flat, boosted from Wednesday's fall by Cemex, which gained 2.13 percent. Among major equities markets, Brazil's Bovespa index led gains with a 1.49 percent rise, thanks in part to solid foreign capital inflows from investors looking to buy into a nascent consumer recovery in Latin America's largest economy. \"With signs of good international liquidity remaining, Brazil can still be attractive to new resources from foreign investors,\" brokerage Magliano wrote in a note. Among the biggest winners on the Bovespa was private education company Est\u00e1cio Participa\u00e7\u00f5es SA, which rose 3.07 percent after analysts issued an outperform rating and raised the target price. Its rival, Kroton Educacional SA, was the biggest loser on the index, slipping 3.63 percent.

I need to know who the manufacturers [are] and I need to trust and only let people in that I want in my network.\"\nNo. 2 on the list is scalability. Shippers often carry tens of thousands of containers across thousands of ships, so the network that serves those enterprises must be able to scale.\n\"We're operating in the thousands and thousands of transactions per second. That suits an enterprise world. Bitcoin can't do that, as an example,\" Schroeter said.\nThe third thing companies look for when implementing blockchain is immutability, or the inability to erase or reverse a transaction, the former CFO told Cramer.\n\"When you buy a share, the reason it takes three days [to process] is because somebody has a physical share. But the blockchain, it makes it so our blockchains are immutable. Nobody can go back and say that didn't really happen,\" Schroeter said.\nAs IBM's earnings recover after 23 quarters of declining revenues, Schroeter maintained a focus on the company's long term goals, particularly with regards to the country's new tax laws .\n\"The cause of our tax rate to go up is tax reform,\" Schroeter acknowledged. \"But we have been supporters and we remain big supporters of tax reform because over the long term \u2014 and IBM always manages over the long term \u2014 over the long term, it's going to free up our capital [and] it gives us a territorial system so we can invest on par with our competitors.\"\nWatch Martin Schroeter's full interview here: show chapters IBM executive says blockchain 'creates a lot of value' for manufacturers, retailers 20 Hours Ago | 12:15 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

The network's goal is to bring in a new wave of buyers by making bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper. \nIf the network fails, Ciotoli says, his year-end bitcoin target could drop as low as $5,000. \n\"If I don't see people actually able to use bitcoin to say 'buy Starbucks' or something.

The survey\u2019s authors said a number of respondents signalled that they were receiving higher new orders from customers in North America. \n\u201cGiven the strong conditions evident in the manufacturing sector, it is no surprise to see that firms are upbeat about the outlook, with more than six times as many companies expecting to see growth in 2018 as opposed to those who anticipate a decline,\u201d said Investec Ireland chief economist Philip O\u2018Sullivan. \n\u201cWith global growth expected to improve to a seven-year high in 2018, we think that firms are right to be confident about their prospects for this year.\u201d Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Hugh Lawson"}

The U.S. government has also been pressing China on multiple fronts including fairer bilateral trade and greater market access for U.S. companies. \n\u201cIn the last 30 days of 2017, the U.S. government launched a Section 301 investigation into Chinese intellectual property and technology transfer, self-initiated probes into Chinese-made aluminum products, and rejected China\u2019s market economy status at the World Trade Organization,\u201d Xinhua said in a commentary on Wednesday. \n\u201cThe bonhomie that grew between China and the United States in Beijing in November, when the two signed hundreds of billions of dollars of deals, seems to be fading away as the U.S. side is stuck in a zero-sum mentality,\u201d it said. \nIt added that retaliatory measures from China \u201ccould be on the table\u201d should the United States continue on its current course. \nAnt Financial is controlled by Jack Ma, executive chairman of Chinese internet conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd , and other Alibaba executives. The firm sought to buy money transfer firm MoneyGram to boost its global footprint amid fierce competition from rival Tencent Holdings Ltd\u2019s WeChat payment platform. \nSources familiar with the matter told Reuters the U.S. panel blocked the deal on concerns about the safety of the data that can be used to identify U.S. citizens, rejecting proposals from Ant Financial and MoneyGram that sought to mitigate such risks. \n\u201cWith deep-rooted strategic mistrust toward China, U.S. politicians have failed to catch up with China\u2019s understanding of cooperation and adopted an increasingly protective and isolationist approach,\u201d the Xinhua commentary said. \nChina\u2019s foreign ministry said separately on Wednesday that it hopes the U.S. can create a level playing field and a predictable environment for Chinese firms.

Noise-induced damage to the nearly 15,000 tiny hair cells and neurons in the cochlea or to the auditory nerve is by far the leading cause of what's known as sensorineural hearing loss . \nIn order to develop drugs to accurately target either the auditory nerve or hair cells, Decibel's researchers delve into the anatomy of the inner ear, down to the cellular level. \"If you don't do the fundamental work to understand what you're trying to achieve and actually getting the drug in there, it's shooting in the dark in terms of doing clinical development,\" Cobb said. \nIn late November, Decibel entered into a partnership with Regeneron, a biotech drug developer in Tarrytown, New York. Besides accessing Regeneron 's robust research tools, particularly in genetics, Decibel also will benefit from its financial support. Decibel, however, retains worldwide development and commercialization rights to any products discovered in the collaboration and will pay Regeneron tiered royalties based on net sales. Building a solution that uses the body's organic design \nJust north of Boston, in Woburn, Massachusetts, Frequency Therapeutics was founded in 2015 by biomedical engineers Bob Langer of MIT and Jeffrey Karp of Harvard Medical School. Frequency's focus is on developing small molecule drugs that activate dormant progenitor cells, types of stem cells, to repair damaged cochlear hair cells and restore hearing. \"It's important to do it in an organic way, as the body had originally designed it to be done,\" said David Lucchino, co-founder, president and CEO of Frequency. \nHe likens the process to immunotherapy, which activates the body's immune system, an increasingly successful approach in treating cancer. \"We are reactivating the body's system and letting it do the work,\" Lucchino said. Boston Globe | Getty Images Frequency Therapeutics founders Bob Langer, David Lucchino, and Jeff Karp in Cambridge, Massachusetts, April 10, 2017. The company is developing disease-modifying treatment for hearing loss. \nDelivering its drugs to the hard-to-reach hair cells has been a limiting factor. One of Frequency's key breakthroughs was figuring out how to grow cochlear tissue outside the body to do proper drug screening, thereby allowing researchers to identify the small molecules that have this effect. \"The challenge is to translate that to inside the body and show you can get the biological response in humans,\" Lucchino said. \"That's what we're doing in the clinic now.\" \nIn December the company announced the successful completion of a Phase 1 human study of FX-322, Frequency's lead progenitor cell activation drug, demonstrating its safety and tolerability. \"We expect to start a Phase 2 clinical study in the second half of 2018,\" Lucchino said. The company has previously raised $32 million in Series A funding from CoBro Ventures, Morningside Ventures, Alexandria Real Estate Equities and other investors, and expects to begin a Series B round later this year. A few small publicly traded firms also pursuing breakthroughs \nTwo publicly traded companies are making noise in this space. Auris Medical , a Swiss biopharmaceutical firm, is in advanced clinical development of drugs to treat inner-ear hearing loss and tinnitus, the condition of ringing or buzzing in the ears. \nSan Diego-based Otonomy , founded in 2008, has taken a three-pronged approach in its drug R&D. The first targets chemotherapy-induced hearing loss, a side effect of some cancer-fighting medicines, in particular platinum-based agents. \"We've conducted preliminary clinical research in that area and are working to develop a product,\" said CEO and president David Weber. \nOtonomy also concentrates on treating sensorineural destruction of the ribbon synapse connections that connect hair cells to the auditory nerve bundle, which results in earlier-stage hearing loss. That condition might not be profound enough to be detected in a hearing test, Weber said, \"but is contributing to what I'll call 'cocktail noise' hearing loss: You can't distinguish sounds at a cocktail party where there's a lot of background sound.\" \nOtonomy has developed a drug therapy, which has shown proof of concept in an animal model, to restore synapse connections and functional hearing. Otonomy also is developing medicines to restore the loss of hair cells. All three programs are in the preclinical stages, Weber said, and he declined to predict how soon any would move to the human clinical trial stage. \nAlthough one or more drugs that might temporarily or permanently repair inner-ear damage and restore hearing loss is still several years away from commercial availability, Decibel's Cobb offered some sound advice on how to prevent hearing problems. \"The best way to handle noise damage,\" she said, \"is to wear earplugs.\" \n\u2014 Bob Woods, special to CNBC.com Bob Woods Special to CNBC.com Related Securities"}

{"published":"2018-01-11T05:51:00.000+02:00","title":"Explainer: Could China tame its appetite for U.S. Treasuries?","text":"(Reuters) - China is the world\u2019s biggest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, which it uses to manage the value of its currency and park its massive foreign exchange reserves. But a Bloomberg report on Wednesday suggested that China may be reviewing its vast holdings, sending Treasury yields to 10-month highs.\nStill, many factors limit China\u2019s room for maneuver when it comes to Treasuries.\nWhy does China own $1.2 trillion of Treasuries in the first place?\nIn part because Treasuries are the only instruments seen as liquid enough to park part of China\u2019s massive foreign exchange reserves, which have surged thanks to years of export surpluses.\nChina also fixes its exchange rate against the dollar, so its buying and selling of dollar assets is largely aimed at managing the value of its currency. Data from the U.S. Treasury shows that, over time, Chinese holdings of Treasuries have been relatively stable.\nCould China really dump, or at least pare, those holdings?\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China would trigger a selloff if market participants believed it has truly soured on Treasuries, which would cause the value of its own reserves to fall. That is not an outcome that would appear to be palatable politically or for economic reasons.\nAnd even if the PBOC, China\u2019s central bank, were to dial back its Treasuries holdings, there appear to be few options to replace them. Ten-year U.S. Treasuries yields are more than 200 basis higher than those on comparable German Bunds. Japanese 10-year government bonds yield about zero.\nStill, some analysts said China could move investments to other dollar denominated debt such as mortgages or deposits, reallocate investments to euro, yen or other currency-based assets or buy debt from emerging countries.\nIs China just sending a signal to the United States?\nChina has been discomfited by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tough talk on trade. Some economists and China followers believe the report, which cited people familiar with the matter, could have been intended as a warning shot to the U.S. administration.\nDespite Trump\u2019s tough rhetoric, little progress has been made on aluminum and steel tariffs. And under Trump the U.S. trade deficit with China has actually risen, thanks to a steadily growing U.S. economy and buoyant jobs growth.\nThe U.S trade deficit with China rose to $344.4 million in January-November last year from $319.3 million in the same period in 2016.\nWhat does this all mean for Treasury yields?\nDeclining participation by China could reduce overall demand for U.S. government debt, and the Treasury Department would need to pay higher yields to sell its bonds.\nThe United States will be raising debt issuance to make up for declining bond purchases by the Federal Reserve and ongoing strains on the U.S. budget.\nThe Fed has started shrinking its $2.5 trillion Treasuries portfolio as it seeks to normalize monetary policy. U.S. interest costs rose to a record $274 billion in fiscal 2017, according to the government\u2019s fiscal 2018 budget, and are projected to increase to $528 billion by 2022. [L1N1O428Z]\nIf China retreats, would other buyers step in?\nIf China reduces it bond purchases, buyers that could step in include other sovereigns, banks, large asset managers and insurance companies.\nTreasuries benefit from their relative safety and liquidity compared with other assets. They are also in demand by banks to meet regulatory requirements relating to liquid asset holdings, and they can be used as collateral to back trades including derivatives positions.\nU.S. Treasuries owned by China and Japan Reporting by David Lawder, additional reporting by Karen Brettell; Writing by David Chance; Editing by Megan Davies and Meredith Mazzilli\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."}

This includes investment in new models and expansion of production with the aim of building around 1 million vehicles a year by the turn of the decade. \nIt said growth in China, its largest market, and in the United States helped to offset difficult conditions in Britain and the rest of Europe, where demand was flat. \n\u201cWe have once again delivered year-on-year sales increases thanks to a world-class product range and new models such as the E-PACE and Velar, as well as China-specific models such as the XFL,\u201d group sales operations director Andy Goss said on Monday. \n\u201cBut we are facing tough times in key markets such as the UK where consumer confidence and diesel taxes will hit us.\u201d \nHowever, the company does expect domestic sales to rise this year from 2017\u2019s 118,000 vehicles. \nBritain\u2019s car industry body said last week that 2017 sales across the sector recorded their biggest drop since 2009, blaming plans to increase a levy on new diesel cars and weakening consumer confidence in the wake of Brexit. \nAround 90 percent of Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s (JLR) sales in Britain are diesel models, which compares with around 45 percent globally. \nBritain\u2019s finance minister Philip Hammond said in November that the vehicle excise duty would rise from April for those buying almost any new diesel car, potentially costing hundreds of pounds more for top-end models. \n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to fathom the latest decision in the budget,\u201d Goss told reporters. \nMajor carmakers are scrambling to meet tougher emissions targets and growing demand for cleaner technologies.

One bcfd is enough gas to fuel about five million U.S. homes. \n\u201cThat drop is due to the freeze off we\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Andrew Bradford of BTU Analytics, an energy consultancy. \nNatural gas production often can be affected by water vapor in pipeline systems freezing and hindering the flow of gas. Unlike crude oil, gas must be piped immediately to a processing facility. \nThe National Weather Service (NWS) issued wind chill warnings for much of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains on Tuesday. \nIn Hettinger, North Dakota, temperatures fell to -45\u00b0F (-43\u00b0C) on Tuesday morning, one of the coldest temperatures recorded on the planet for the day, according to the NWS. \nContinental Resources Inc, the second-largest producer in North Dakota, declined to detail the effect cold weather was having on its natural gas output, but said it did expect a drop. \nHess Corp and Cabot Oil and Gas Corp, two of the largest natural gas producers and processors in North Dakota and Pennsylvania, did not respond to requests for comment. \nThe Genscape data relies on monitoring of interstate pipelines and does not take into account natural gas that may be used in state in power plants or for other uses. Texas and Oklahoma, for example, use most of their natural gas at facilities in state. \nIn Texas, natural gas transport on interstate pipelines is down about 20 percent. In Oklahoma, the drop is about 22 percent, and in Pennsylvania\u2019s Marcellus shale, the drop is about 5 percent, according to Genscape. \nNatural gas demand in the lower 48 U.S. states is expected to reach an all-time high of 144.0 billion cubic feet per day on Tuesday, which would top Monday\u2019s record 142.0 bcfd, according to Reuters data going back to 2008.

It does exist, but the window closes so fast that if you blink you'll miss it,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \"Still, if you're ready to pounce, you can pick up some high-quality stocks at discounted prices.\"\nExhibit A? The government shutdown, which started at midnight on Saturday and ended with a deal struck on Monday afternoon.\nThe major averages slid from their highs at Monday's opening bell as investors processed what the shutdown meant for equities. But Cramer struggled to link it to any tangible effects.\n\"Historically, if we have a delay in tax refund checks from the IRS, it would cause weak year-over-year comparisons for the dollar store chains, the auto parts retailers, anything where consumers will have to postpone their spending. That's been the pattern,\" Cramer said. \"But if you had a chance to pick those stocks up into weakness today because it was the pattern, you had to take it.\"\nMany of the dollar store and auto parts stocks held strong, resuming their marches higher shortly after the market opened; shares of Dollar General even hit a 52-week high.\n\"In other words, the shutdown gave you that brief window, that brief chance to buy the stocks of companies that could be hurt only temporarily,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\nExhibit B was the stock of Schlumberger , the world's biggest oilfield services company. When oil prices recently broke through the $60 benchmark, shares of Schlumberger surged with them.\nCramer has long lauded Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard for running a good business and accurately calling the most recent top and bottom for oil prices.\nBut some investors soured on Schlumberger after it reported earnings without any meaningful upside surprise and Kibsgaard forecast that the next quarter would be difficult for the company.\nThen, seemingly out of nowhere, Kibsgaard predicted that the second and third quarters would be very strong thanks to various international drivers like increased drilling outside the country.\n\"Today, Halliburton , a major oil service competitor, crushes the number and Schlumberger's stock tacks on another 3 [basis points],\" Cramer said. \"You blink, you miss the whole darned thing.\"\nExhibit C was Goldman Sachs , an investment bank that just reported earnings. Cramer was surprised at how well it did despite the 50 percent drop in bond trading revenue, a major driver for the business.\nStill, Cramer knows Goldman to be a company that reinvents itself, so he remained bullish on its trajectory.\n\"The rest of Goldman's businesses are on fire, so it's not like they even need to do that much reinventing. Yet the stock sells for less than 11 times earnings \u2014 it's the cheapest I've ever seen it on a price-to-earnings basis,\" he said. \"My advice last week was that you should wait two days after the quarter was announced as the insiders always depress the stock with their traditional selling as the window opens, and then you had to buy. Now the window's closed, boom, it's off to the races.\"\nCramer hoped that Goldman would explore the advantages of the cryptocurrency market, predicting that if the bank did, its stock could rally 10 percent.\n\"But even without any catalysts, Goldman Sachs' stock is just too cheap to ignore,\" he said.\nSo as investors search for good buys in a market where buying opportunities are scant, Cramer strongly recommended they focus on doing their homework and staying calm when high-quality stocks drop for low-quality reasons.\n\"Finding bargains in this beast of a bull market is a real and rigorous high wire act where the wire's thin, there's no net and you only have a few seconds to think,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"But if you're prepared ahead of time, you can profit from these intraday pullbacks and you can rack up some terrific wins.\"\nWATCH: Cramer finds windows of opportunity across the market show chapters Cramer: Blink and you'll miss this market's windows of opportunity 19 Hours Ago | 12:10 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Schlumberger.\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

{"published":"2018-01-05T21:01:00.000+02:00","title":"Twice-weekly workouts may be best medicine for cognitive decline","text":"(Reuters Health) - - There\u2019s little evidence that medications improve mild cognitive decline associated with aging, according to a new review of research, but doctors can recommend exercise with confidence.\nResearchers reviewed 11,530 studies of so-called mild cognitive impairment (MCI), to see how many older people are affected and which interventions and lifestyle changes have been shown to improve symptoms.\nMCI becomes increasingly common at older ages and is characterized by mild problems with thinking and memory that usually don\u2019t interfere with daily life or independent function. People diagnosed with MCI are more likely, however, to go on to develop Alzheimer\u2019s or other dementias than people without it.\nUntil now, said Ronald Petersen, the lead author of the new study and American Academy of Neurology (AAN) treatment guidelines, \u201cClinicians didn\u2019t know what to do with these people. Now that we know that it\u2019s a burgeoning condition we need to pay attention when folks come in and complain.\u201d\nPetersen, who directs the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center in Rochester, Minnesota, and his coauthors found that between ages 60 and 64, 6.7 percent of people have MCI. In the 65-69 age group, that rises to 8.4 percent, and about 10 percent at ages 70-74, nearly 15 percent at 75-79 and just over 25 percent at ages 80 to 84.\nWhen they looked at the use of drugs, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, they found \u201cno high-quality evidence\u201d that the medications work, according to the report in the journal Neurology.\nTheir analysis of studies looking at the effects of physical exercise on cognition did find a benefit, though. In one study involving 86 women with MCI, 70 to 80 years old, researchers found that twice-weekly resistance training for 26 weeks was more effective than aerobic training over the same time period at increasing what\u2019s known as executive functioning. After completing the exercise regimen, the women were better able to plan, manage and organize their thoughts.\nBased on their review, the authors updated a practice guideline for MCI to include, for the first time, a recommendation that people with the syndrome should exercise regularly as part of an overall approach to managing their symptoms.\n\u201cThis is a rich area of study. I don\u2019t think you can say that if you exercise 150 minutes a week you can push back cognitive decline a certain number of years,\u201d Petersen said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that for sure, but . . . physical exercise might be beneficial in slowing down the rate of cognitive decline since it has been shown to cause some stabilization or improvement of cognition.\u201d\nHe thinks a combination of aerobic exercise and resistance training is likely best for MCI patients, but the data about its long-term effectiveness remains \u201cscant.\u201d He recommends that patients with MCI try to work up a sweat by walking briskly for 50 minutes, three times a week, because it might improve blood flow to the brain or induce enzymes to break down proteins that can build up into brain plaques.\nNeurology researchers are hoping to develop more specific evidence-based guidelines on how much exercise and what kind is needed to potentially delay or prevent cognitive decline based on ongoing clinical trials, he noted.\nThe new AAN guideline, which is endorsed by the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, also urges clinicians to discuss with their MCI patients the diagnosis, prognosis, long-term planning and the lack of evidence that drugs and dietary options, such as vitamins E and C, homocysteine-lowering B vitamins and flavonoid-containing drinks, are at all effective.\nPetersen and his colleagues also analyzed five studies of brain-training interventions and found \u201cinsufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any individual cognitive intervention strategy.\u201d Nevertheless, they conclude that doctors may recommend this approach because it might improve specific cognitive skills.\n\u201cContinuing to be cognitively and physically active is paramount for overall brain health,\u201d noted Dr. Neelum T. Aggarwal of the Rush Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Center in Chicago, who wasn\u2019t involved in the review or guidelines.\nSome cases of MCI are associated with reversible causes of cognitive impairment, including medication side effects, sleep apnea, depression and other medical conditions, so it\u2019s important for patients to visit their healthcare provider at the first sign of memory problems, he said in a phone interview.\nSOURCE: bit.ly\/2BV4fVp Neurology, online December 27, 2017.\n "}

Automakers will provide specific models in paperwork that will be filed later this month with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nNotices of the expanded recalls were posted Saturday on the agency's website .\nTakata uses the chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion and fill air bags quickly in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to high humidity and temperatures and burn too fast, blowing apart a metal canister. That can hurl hot shrapnel into unsuspecting drivers and passengers.\nAt least 20 people have been killed worldwide and more than 180 injured.\nThe latest recalls are part of the largest series of automotive recalls in U.S. history, with 19 automakers having to recall up to 69 million inflators in 42 million vehicles. The problem brought a criminal conviction and fine against Takata and forced the Japanese company into bankruptcy protection.\nThe recalls, which are being managed by NHTSA, are being phased in over the next three years. Older models and those in states with high humidity and temperatures are getting priority.\nMany automakers have been slow to replace the potentially deadly inflators. A report by an independent monitor said that as of Sept. 15, 2017, automakers have recalled 43.1 million inflators. Of those, only 18.5 million, or 43 percent, have been replaced even though Takata recalls began in 2001.\nNHTSA has said the Takata recalls are unprecedented in size and complexity and have resulted in groundbreaking lessons that will help automakers reach their repair goals. The agency said it is monitoring the automakers' progress and working to expand best practices to boost completion rates. The agency also has the authority to fine automakers that don't make recall repairs in a timely manner."}

The U.N. agency, founded in 1949 to aid Palestinian refugees, is a main provider of educational and health services in the Gaza Strip. \nNetanyahu said UNRWA was \u201can organization that perpetuates the Palestinian problem.\u201d \n\u201cIt also enshrines the narrative of the so-called \u2018right of return\u2019. Therefore, UNRWA should pass from the world,\u201d he told a weekly cabinet meeting. \nNetanyahu made almost identical comments about dismantling UNRWA in June - a message he said at the time he had conveyed to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

He said U.N. money for them should be transferred gradually to its global refugee agency UNHCR \u201cwith clear criteria for supporting genuine refugees and not fictitious ones, as is happening today under UNRWA.\u201d \nChris Gunness, an UNRWA spokesman, said the refugee crisis was being perpetuated by \u201cfailure of the parties to deal with the issue...\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrives to attend the weekly cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem January 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Abir Sultan\/Pool \n\u201cUNRWA is mandated by the General Assembly to continue with its services until a just and lasting solution is found for the Palestine refugees,\u201d Gunness said in a statement. \nPalestinian officials have said Trump\u2019s declaration on Jerusalem, overturning decades of U.S. policy, meant he could not serve as an honest broker in peace negotiations that Washington has been trying to revive, and they condemned his remarks on a funding halt as blackmail. \nPalestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. \nThe United States is the largest donor to UNRWA, with a pledge of nearly $370 million as of 2016, according to the organization\u2019s website. Gunness said the agency had not been \u201cinformed directly of a formal decision either way by the U.S. administration\u201d on cuts. \nIn addition to its services in Gaza, UNRWA operates in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. editing by John Stonestreet"}

{"published":"2018-01-03T01:32:00.000+02:00","title":"Commentary: The best way to respond to Iran protests","text":"Iran\u2019s deadly wave of protests has taken the government and security forces by surprise.\nWhat started off in the holy city of Mashhad as demonstrations over unpaid wages and inflation quickly spread throughout the country, widening to include grievances about government mismanagement, corruption and Tehran\u2019s involvement in Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. Unlike the mainly urban demonstrations that followed the contested 2009 election, these protests have spread to Ahvaz, Kermanshah, Rasht and Qazvin \u2013 all rural and relatively poorer cities.\nThe national groundswell means that the government must take these demonstrations seriously.\nHere are five points for policymakers to consider:\n1. Economics 101\nThe overarching theme of these protests seems to be Iran\u2019s perpetually mismanaged economy. Inflation, unemployment, corruption and years of sanctions have led to a shadow financial system that often benefits elites and leaves the middle class and poor further behind every year. President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s first campaign for the presidency in 2013 was framed in terms of getting a nuclear deal done and unshackling Iran\u2019s economy from years of sanctions. Yet while sanctions certainly exacerbated long-standing structural problems of a mostly state-run economy, they were not the underlying cause of Iran\u2019s woes.\nUnemployment today in Iran stands at 12 percent (youth unemployment is above 20 percent). Inflation since the 1979 revolution has fluctuated between 17 percent during the 1980s to a peak of 49 percent percent during the 1990s. In the early 2000s, under the stewardship of reformist President Mohammad Khatami, it was tamed at around 15 percent but then skyrocketed again under firebrand President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to 30 percent \u2013 the latter occurring at a time when oil prices were at record highs and Iran\u2019s currency had devalued by more than 450 percent .\nTo Rouhani's credit, his administration has had some success in taming inflation (it stands at closer to 10 percent today) and Iran\u2019s economy has rebounded considerably since nuclear-related sanctions were lifted two years ago. The IMF recently forecast growth at 4.2 percent this year, after Iran\u2019s economy grew at 7 percent last year. However, it is unclear who has benefited from this improvement. Those protesting have seen their purchasing power decrease as prices have risen and subsides were cut. Rouhani\u2019s supporters argue that it will take time for the average Iranians to feel the benefits of sanctions relief and for the economy to stabilize; those protesting have lost hope that reforms can make their lives better in any meaningful way.\n2. The role of Iran\u2019s regional policy\nOver the years, many protesters in Iran have chanted slogans against Iran\u2019s activist foreign policy. The slogans amount to this: why is the government spending money on Iraq, Syria and Lebanon and not spending it on its own people?\nThis is a legitimate grievance, and the fact that it is now being expressed by poorer Iranians traditionally considered to be the regime\u2019s base of support makes it particularly noteworthy.\nProtesters gather on the streets of Tehran, Iran December 30, 2017, in this picture obtained from social media. REUTERS. However, broad segments of Iranian society may not share the protesters\u2019 opposition to Iran\u2019s involvement in these countries. Islamic State and Wahhabi Islam, the state-sponsored religion of Saudi Arabia, are viewed as existential threats by many Iranians. They believe that it\u2019s better to fight Sunni fundamentalism in Iraq and Syria rather than inside Iran\u2019s borders. The attacks last summer by Islamic State on a religious shrine and parliament in Tehran drove this point home. Washington, Riyadh and Tel Aviv should not expect the protests to have an impact on Iran\u2019s regional policies.\n3. Trump\u2019s support doesn\u2019t help the protesters\nDonald Trump has taken to Twitter to announce his support for the protesters. His words ring hollow. The fact remains that the U.S. president is deeply unpopular among Iranians, who view his administration as hostile to them, not just their government. His travel ban on Iranians has torn families apart and offended Americans who have Iranian relatives no longer able to visit them.\nTrump\u2019s refusal to certify Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal (despite all evidence to the contrary), his attempts to discourage other countries from engaging Iran and his wholesale embrace of Saudi Arabia\u2019s narrative blaming Tehran for all conflicts in the Middle East make him a strange bedfellow for Iran\u2019s protesters.\nForeign interference in Iran\u2019s internal affairs has left deep scars in the consciousness of the Iranian public for decades. The Trump administration should be mindful of exploiting the demonstrations and risk tainting the protesters as foreign agents, an easy tagline the regime uses to discredit dissidents.\n4. What will happen next?\nIt\u2019s difficult to say at this nascent stage. The protests have been small and scattered. No indigenous leadership has been identified. Most Iranians have chosen to stay away for fear of reprisals \u2013 at least 14 people have died and hundreds have been arrested so far \u2013 or because they prefer to work within a political system they have lived under for 38 years to effect change rather than starting from scratch.\nIt is vital for President Rouhani to listen to the grievances of the demonstrators. He needs to deliver on his campaign promises of economic and social reforms. That means confronting elements of the deep state, nepotism and corruption. He can even utilize these protests to strengthen his mandate. Given the political upheaval and instability that has taken over the region since the Arab spring, it\u2019s doubtful that most Iranians would prefer revolution to meaningful reform. What is certain is that they want their daily needs met and less government involvement in their personal lives.\n5. The fallout for Iranian politics\nDespite the portrayal of Iranian politics as a monolith by many Western analysts, it is highly factionalized with competing power centers and a myriad of special interests. Expect hard-line factions close to Ebrahim Raisi, Rouhani\u2019s main rival in last year\u2019s election, and the security services to blame President Rouhani for the protests. They will portray his government as having failed the urban poor and exaggerating the benefits of the nuclear deal. On the other side, expect Rouhani supporters to blame hard-line factions for blocking needed economic reforms and stifling the relaxation of Islamic dress code on women.\nBoth groups will aim to influence the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, who will stay above the fray \u2013 at least in public. He will reprimand all sides for using the protests for political gain. He will blame outsiders, particularly those in the West for fomenting instability. In private, however, he should back Rouhani and give him the latitude to aggressively pursue his agenda. He should remind hardliners that time and demographics are not on their side as 60 percent of Iran\u2019s population is under 30 . If the government\u2019s only response is to contain the protests by force, more will follow.\nAbout the Author Amir Handjani is a Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council and a Fellow with the Truman National Security Project @ahandjani\n "}

Africa was once seen as a ripe area of opportunity for the firm, which set up two ventures in 2008 to invest in African mining and oil and mineral interests. That year, the unidentified UK charitable foundation agreed to invest $200 million in one of those investment funds. \nAmong other charges, Cohen concealed a conflict of interest he had connected with an investment in a mining company, according to the indictment. Some of the shares in that mining company had been sold to the Och Ziff African investing venture by an unnamed co-conspirator who owed Cohen $18 million connected to the purchase of a luxury yacht. This person was going to use proceeds from the sale those shares to partially pay back that personal loan. \nCohen and the unnamed co-conspirator faked and backdated a letter to conceal the scheme, prosecutors said, and Cohen later lied about it to law enforcement. \nA lawyer for Cohen wasn't immediately available to comment. A spokesman for Och Ziff said in an email, \"The allegations in the indictment against Michael Cohen do not raise any new issues for the firm, which has settled the matter.\" \nThe case comes after a Securities and Exchange Commission case last year accusing Cohen and another former Och Ziff official of engaging in a widespread bribery scheme to win business in Africa. \nFederal investigators have been looking into violations of anti-corruption laws by funds for several years. In Och Ziff's case the inquiries involved activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Libya and other African nations and prompted investors such as public pensions and foundations to pull their investments from the firm. \nCohen was in charge of investing activities in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the U.S. Attorney's office said. Och Ziff is run by the billionaire Daniel Och, a former Goldman Sachs trader. \nIn 2016, the firm agreed to pay more than $200 million to the Justice Department for paying more than $100 million in bribes to win natural resources deals in Africa. It also agreed to pay another nearly $200 million to the SEC. Daniel Och paid $2.2 million in the SEC settlement, though the agency said he wasn't aware of the bribes."}

He was 85. \nWriting in Hebrew, the Romanian-born Appelfeld penned more than 40 books and was one of Israel\u2019s most widely translated authors. \nAppelfeld\u2019s \u201cBlooms of Darkness\u201d, the tale of an 11-year-old boy hidden from the Nazis by a prostitute, won the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize in London in 2012. Appelfeld was also awarded the State of Israel Prize for Literature in 1983 and was a Man Booker International Prize finalist in 2013. \nIsraeli President Reuven Rivlin, on Twitter, expressed sorrow \u201cabout the passing of our beloved writer\u201d. \nAmos Oz, one of Israel\u2019s most prominent novelists, said on Army Radio that Appelfed shied away from graphic depictions of the Holocaust, choosing instead to describe its effect on the lives of his characters. \n\u201cAppelfeld never wrote about gas chambers, never wrote about executions, about mass graves, atrocities and experiments on human beings. He wrote about survivors before and after. He wrote about people who did not know what was about to happen to them and about people who already knew everything but hardly spoke about it,\u201d Oz said on Army Radio. \n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want, or he was unable, to write depictions of the horrors - he said that too. They are beyond the ability of human language to express them. You have to approach them indirectly, tiptoeing from afar,\u201d said Oz, once Appelfeld\u2019s student in a kibbutz. \nAppelfeld was a young boy when his mother was killed by the Nazis. He and his father were sent to a concentration camp in Transnistria in an area of Ukraine then under control of the German-allied Romanian forces. Aged 10 at the time, he escaped and spent three years hiding in forests in Ukraine. \n\u201cI survived in the fields and forests. Sometimes I worked as a shepherd or taking care of broken-down horses,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1986. \u201cI lived with marginal people during the war - prostitutes, horse thieves, witches, fortune tellers. They gave me my real education.\u201d \nAfter the war, he immigrated to Israel - he learned Hebrew beforehand - and when he was 28 he discovered that his father had survived and they were reunited in Israel. \n\u201cEven though I spent time on kibbutzim that tried to change me, I did not change.

Photo: Advertising Standards Authority The U.K. ad code states that no media outlet should be used to advertise alcoholic drinks if more than 25% of its audience is under 18. According to the ruling, Diageo said that data provided from Snap in 2016 showed 77% of U.K. Snapchat users were registered as 18 or older.\nHowever, the ASA referenced 2016 research from U.K. communications regulator Ofcom that indicated that while the minimum age to sign up for Snapchat is 13, 34% of a group of 104 social media users between the ages of 8 and 11 were on the app. And 58% of a group of 12- to 15-year-olds said they were on Snapchat.\nThe data \u201ccalled into question the adequacy of self-reported age as the sole means of targeting,\u201d the ASA wrote, concluding Captain Morgan hadn\u2019t taken \u201csufficient care\u201d to ensure the ad wasn\u2019t directed at children. The ASA also concluded that the \u201cchild-like cartoon image\u201d for the interactive and augmented features of the lens were likely to appeal to kids.\n\u201cWe have now stopped all advertising on Snapchat globally whilst we assess the incremental age verification safeguards that Snapchat are implementing,\u201d Diageo said in its statement.\nWhile the ASA\u2019s ruling is limited to a single campaign, it could potentially encourage more alcohol marketers to put in tougher targeting safeguards when running campaigns on apps popular among young people. The issue also could be relevant on other big social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, that ask people to self-report their age.\nSince the Captain Morgan campaign ran, Snap has launched \u201cAudience Lenses,\u201d a version of \u201cSponsored Lenses\u201d that allow advertisers to not only direct their ads at certain age groups, but to supplement that targeting with \u201clifestyle categories,\u201d which are based on users\u2019 interests and activity within the app.\nCMO Today Newsletter Get your daily dose of media and advertising news with WSJ\u2019s CMO Today newsletter. Sign up here .\nGuidance from the Committee of Advertising Practice, which writes the U.K. advertising code, states that \u201cwhere possible,\u201d marketers placing age-restricted ads should aim to support their targeting with behavioral data that excludes people with interests strongly associated with younger people\u2014a teen music festival, for example.\nIn a statement, a Snap spokeswoman said the company was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the ASA\u2019s decision and disagrees Captain Morgan intentionally directed its ad to an underage audience because it applied the accurate age-targeting methods made available at the time. The spokeswoman also said Snapchat uses its own data, plus that of third-party measurement services such as Nielsen, to validate users\u2019 real ages.\n\u201cSnapchat now offers among the most sophisticated targeting in the industry and by introducing new tools such as Audience Lenses and incorporating additional signals into our targeting, advertisers have a reliable and flexible way to ensure their ads reach the right audience,\u201d the statement continued.\nHaving an advertiser pull spending, even temporarily, is a blow to Snap at a time when it is struggling to grow its 178 million daily users and meet Wall Street\u2019s expectations for ad revenue growth . Snap\u2019s third-quarter revenue rose 62% to $207.9 million, but analysts had expected $236.9 million.\nDiageo declined to comment about the company\u2019s Snapchat advertising budget. The company said in filings that it spent about \u00a31.8 billion ($2.4 billion) on marketing in the year ended June 30, up from about \u00a31.6 billion in its previous financial year. \nThe Snapchat campaign isn\u2019t the first time in recent years the Captain Morgan brand has run afoul of the ASA. In 2016, the watchdog banned a Captain Morgan TV ad for implying that alcohol could give you confidence. And in 2014, the Diageo brand was ordered to pull a Facebook ad after the ASA ruled the ad broke the rules for suggesting that alcohol could help people overcome boredom . \nWrite to Lara O\u2019Reilly at lara.o'reilly@wsj.com"}

He said the coalition blueprint clinched on Friday would pave the way for a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d on Europe away from austerity and towards more investment and jobs. \nThe 28-page document was also welcomed by French President Emmanuel Macron, whose plans for an ambitious reform of the EU, including an overhaul of euro zone governance, were dealt a blow by an inconclusive German election in September and the political limbo that followed. \nThe draft, which could form the basis for Merkel\u2019s third \u201cgrand coalition\u201d government since taking power in 2005, raises the prospect of an \u201cinvestment budget\u201d for the single currency bloc, a nod to Macron\u2019s call for a budget to help the euro zone cope with external economic shocks. \nIt also calls for the ESM bailout mechanism to be turned into a full-blown European Monetary Fund under parliamentary control and anchored in EU law. \nIn a sign of lingering divisions between Berlin and Paris, Macron on Friday questioned the logic of such a fund and stressed the need to complete the EU\u2019s \u201cbanking union\u201d, a vital project designed to sever the link between troubled banks and sovereign lenders. Berlin has been reluctant to move to the final stage by establishing a common deposit insurance scheme. \n\u201cCRUNCH YEAR\u201d \nAs Merkel was celebrating her deal with the SPD on Friday, Paris was rolling out the red carpet for Mario Centeno, the new president of the Eurogroup forum of euro zone finance ministers, in a signal to other countries that Macron means business. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not insignificant and certainly not innocent in terms of the message,\u201d a French finance ministry source said of the visit by Centeno, who met with Macron, Le Maire and Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. \nBerlin and Paris now face a race against time to reconcile differences over how to make the euro zone crisis-proof after years of financial trauma that nearly tore the 19-nation bloc apart. Merkel and Macron have promised to come up with a joint position by March. \n\u201c2018 is a crunch year,\u201d said the French source. \u201cYou\u2019re moving into the European election period from early 2019 and onwards so the objective is to have something to show people.\u201d \nTo help break the deadlock, a group of 14 economists, including Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo Institute, and Jean Pisani-Ferry, a former adviser to Macron, will unveil new proposals on Wednesday that attempt to bridge German demands for more discipline and France\u2019s insistence on more risk-sharing. \nTheir paper calls for an overhaul of euro area fiscal rules, which they call \u201ccomplex and unreliable\u201d, the creation of an independent fiscal watchdog, and a synthetic euro area \u201csafe asset\u201d that offers investors an alternative to sovereign bonds.

However, it expects its effective tax rate to drop to 19 percent this year from 32 percent last year, which will save it billions of dollars. \nThe sweeping tax changes President Donald Trump signed into law in December, designed to kick-start economic growth, slashed the U.S. corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. \nAs a result, JPMorgan said it expects corporations to borrow more, offer more stock and pursue more mergers and acquisitions, all of which would boost revenue. \nAlthough the bank plans to use some of that money for compensation, business investments, helping rural communities and other uses, it will mostly boost profits, executives said on a call with analysts. \n\u201cMuch of it will fall to our bottom line in 2018 and beyond,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on a call with analysts. \nThe bank\u2019s shareholders should benefit as JPMorgan returns more capital to them through dividends and stock buybacks, she said. \nSeveral financial companies, including Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), have warned investors that they will face short-term pain over some of the tax changes. However, over the longer term, the changes are widely expected to generate gains for large U.S. corporations. \nSome of the benefits will likely be lost as banks vie to offer better deals to customers, starting with businesses where prices change more quickly, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said. \nJPMorgan\u2019s charges related to a one-time repatriation tax on income it has kept abroad and adjusting the value of its deferred tax assets and liabilities. The bank said it does not expect to bring any substantive amount of the foreign cash home, because it has capital and liquidity requirements abroad. \nJPMorgan\u2019s shares were up 1.3 percent at $112.18.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo RISING RATES, STEINHOFF WOES \nExcluding one-time items, JPMorgan\u2019s fourth-quarter profit was higher than analysts had expected. Rising interest rates produced gains in net interest income that offset a slowdown in trading revenue. \nThe bank's adjusted net profit was $6.7 billion, or $1.76 per share, compared with the average estimate of $1.69 per share. Net revenue rose 4.6 percent to $25.45 billion and beat the estimate of $25.15 billion. ( bit.ly\/2AR7AUe ) \nIncluding the tax charge, its net profit fell to $4.23 billion, or $1.07 per share, from $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, a year earlier. \nAnalysts were generally positive about the results, although some asked for more detail on how the bank will use its expected tax savings and expressed concern about the benefits fading quickly in a competitive environment. \nJPMorgan\u2019s earnings per share would have been 17.5 percent higher last year if its taxes had been as low as they will be going forward, according to an estimate by Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI, who rates JPMorgan shares \u201coutperform.\u201d \n\u201cGood economy, lower tax rate and continued JPMorgan-specific strength ... should keep people plenty happy,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients. \nTrading revenue across the industry has been under pressure due to low volatility. Markets were especially active in the year-earlier quarter as investors changed positions around the U.S. election. \nJPMorgan\u2019s bond trading revenue fell 27 percent. Equity trading revenue was flat, after a mark-to-market loss of $143 million on a margin loan related to troubled South African furniture retailer Steinhoff International ( SNHJ.J ) ( SNHG.DE ). \nThe bank set aside an additional $130 million for potential credit losses related to Steinhoff, which has been embroiled in an accounting scandal. \nLake said other banks may also take a hit from the loan which was syndicated. Other banks with substantial lending exposure to Steinhoff include Commerzbank ( CBKG.DE ), UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ), Calyon, BNP ( BNPP.PA ), HSBC ( HSBA.L ), Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Mizuho ( 8411.T ) and Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ). \nRising interest rates helped JPMorgan cushion the blow from lower trading revenue, lifting net interest income by 11 percent to $13.4 billion.

That will provide workers at the bottom of the income ladder with a combined wage increase of more than $5 billion next year, according to figures compiled by the Economic Policy Institute . \nStarting Jan. 1, Maine boosted its bottom pay rate by $1, to $10 an hour, an increase that will benefit an estimated 59,000 workers. California increased its minimum wage by 50 cents, to $11 an hour, helping more than 2 million workers. \nIn most states, the increases are the result of recent laws that raise the pay rates for those at the bottom of the income ladder. Others have laws on the books that automatically boost the minimum wage to keep up with inflation.That's not the case with the federal minimum wage, which is currently $7.25 an hour. Because it's not pegged to inflation, the buying power of a minimum wage paycheck has been falling for the last 50 years, despite periodic increases.In 1968, the statutory minimum wage of $2 an hour was worth about $10.90 an hour in 2017 dollars.

As a 2016 presidential candidate, Trump made \u201cDrain the Swamp\u201d a campaign theme and popular slogan at his political rallies.\nIn the meeting on Tuesday, Trump lamented the animosity between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill.\n\u201cThis system really lends itself to not getting along. It lends itself to hostility and anger,\u201d Trump said of the difficulties of passing legislation since the practice of allowing earmarks was abandoned.\nMemorable examples of the use of earmarks were a \u201cbridge to nowhere\u201d in Alaska and the conviction of Republican Congressman Duke Cunningham of California for taking millions of dollars in bribes linked to special projects.\nSince the practice was banished in 2011, Congress has struggled to carry out its basic job of writing and approving annual budgets.\n\u201cI hear so much about earmarks, the old earmark system, how there was a great friendliness when you had earmarks,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to put better controls because it got a little bit out of hand, but maybe that brings people together. Because our system right now, the way it\u2019s set up, will never bring people together.\u201d\nSome members of Congress have also called for reviving earmarks, but Republican Representative Mark Walker from North Carolina, who chairs a large conservative faction of the House of Representatives, drew a firm line.\n\u201cI can tell you unequivocally most of us are going to have an issue with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of not bringing them back because of the temptation to abuse that process.\u201d\nTrump and congressional Republicans finished 2017 with a victory by passing a landmark tax overhaul bill against the united opposition of Democrats.\nWhile Republicans have majorities in both houses of Congress, they will likely need Democrats\u2019 votes to advance other goals this year given their narrow Senate majority.\nThe president has begun 2018 by seeking bipartisan support for immigration measures and some Democrats attended Tuesday\u2019s meeting.\nAfter the November 2018 congressional elections though, if Republicans lose seats in Congress as historically happens midway through the first term of a new president, Trump will need Democrats even more to follow through on his policy agenda.

Major indexes posted gains better than 0.5 percent in afternoon trading.\nIn his note, Rosenberg wondered whether the Fed will \"remain a serial bubble blower.\" \nThe criticism is familiar: Through low interest rates and trillions of dollars in bond buying, the Fed has created a credit bubble of low-cost cash coursing through the economy and, more particularly, risk assets like stocks and corporate bonds.\nRosie Hallam | Barcroft Media | Getty Images Though the Fed has been in a slow rate-hiking pace since December 2015 \u2014 the December 2017 increase was the sixth in the current cycle \u2014 its benchmark funds rate remains targeted at just 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent.\nRosenberg said the latest run-up in stocks may be due to a market that believes the new Fed, with Powell at the helm, won't be in a hurry to raise rates. A hawkish central bank has been near the top of most Wall Street strategists' lists of what could go wrong in 2018.\n\"The elephant in the living room remains the central banks,\" Rosenberg wrote. \"The prevailing view is that balance sheet tapering will be mild and that Jerome Powell will prove to be a dove. This may well be the most important psychological driver for the market \u2014 that a new and inexperienced Fed will not take the punchbowl away in the coming year.\"\nRosenberg, however, worries about valuations promoted by a Fed policy that is misguided particularly when it comes to inflation. The Fed's targets 2 percent inflation growth as a sign of healthy and sustainable economic growth, but has failed to reach that level despite a decade of historically accommodative policy.\nWhile inflation is not showing up in the traditional indicators like personal consumption expenditures and the Consumer Price Index, Rosenberg said it is elsewhere \u2014 \"art, equities, corporate credit, real estate, cryptocurrencies, commodities, precious metals. Let me know if I have left anything out.\"\nRecent comments from investor Jeremy Grantham warning of a market \"melt-up\" or final push of cash into stocks, followed by a meltdown, caught Rosenberg's eye.\n\"So Jeremy Grantham could well be onto something in his recent blow-off thesis,\" he wrote. \"But he is also intimating that we are heading into the final bubble phase and those don't end well.\""}

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) arrive for a rally for nominee Neil Gorsuch outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., U.S. March 29, 2017. REUTERS\/Aaron P. Bernstein\/File Photo \nSenators Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham, who respectively chair the Senate Judiciary Committee and one of its subcommittees, sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray and U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in which they said former spy Christopher Steele made \u201cfalse statements\u201d about his sharing information in the dossier with U.S. media outlets. \nGrassley and Graham are supporters of a campaign by President Trump and some Republicans to demonize Steele and his dossier and cast doubt over the credibility of official U.S. investigations, including one led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The probes are looking into allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election to help Republican Trump. Moscow denies interference and Trump denies any collusion. \nIn the letter released by the senators, Grassley and Graham neither identify anyone to whom they believed Steele lied nor do they identify any news outlet. The letter makes reference to a \u201cTop Secret\u201d memo that they said relates to \u201ccertain communications between Christopher Steele and multiple U.S. news outlets\u201d regarding the \u201cdossier.\u201d \nSteele had no immediate comment. \nAfter Trump won the Republican nomination in July 2016, backers of Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton started financing Steele\u2019s work via Washington research firm Fusion GPS. The firm had also worked on \u201copposition research\u201d for one of Trump\u2019s opponents in the Republican primary. \nIn an emailed comment, Joshua Levy, a lawyer for Fusion GPS, suggested that the senators\u2019 letter was an effort to undermine the special counsel\u2019s investigation. \n\u201cAfter a year of investigations into Donald Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, the only person Republicans seek to accuse of wrongdoing is one who reported on these matters to law enforcement in the first place,\u201d Levy said. \u201cWe should all be sceptical in the extreme.\u201d \nAlthough several news organizations, including Reuters, were briefed on Steele\u2019s dossier before the November 2016 election, most decided not to report on the material because its inflammatory and sometimes salacious content could not be verified. \nCongressional panels, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, set out to investigate U.S. intelligence agency allegations that Russia conducted a campaign of hacking and disinformation to undermine U.S. democracy in the election, but some of the bipartisanship has eroded. Graham, Grassley and some other Republicans have used official resources to investigate the Steele dossier, Trump critics and officials working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Mueller. \nTwo Trump campaign associates, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and aide George Papadopoulos have pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in Mueller\u2019s probe. \nU.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, on Friday criticized the Republicans\u2019 letter. \n\u201cThis action was taken without any bipartisan cooperation, or even consultation,\u201d Blumenthal said in a statement. \u201cThese vaguely stated, secret allegations seem designed more to distract attention from the priority issues for investigation, and discredit the FBI and other law enforcement.\u201d \nThe Democratic senator said it was \u201cindisputable fact\u201d that the probe of Russian meddling in the election and any possible Trump campaign role \u201cwas triggered by information completely independent from the dossier.\u201d Reporting By Mark Hosenball; editing by Grant McCool"}

However, the TSA still encounters those items \u2014 and lots more \u2014 in passengers' luggage each year.\nThe agency documents many of the odd and offbeat items on its blog and Instagram feed throughout the year, and this week released a top 10 list of verboten items it found in 2017.\nIn a YouTube video, TSA's bearded, bespectacled \"Blogger Bob\" Burns ticks off the \"best of\" list of forbidden items in a countdown format.\nNo. 10 is an intimidating \"face tenderizer\" found in a carry-on bag at Buffalo-Niagara International Airport (BUF) in New York, which resembled a set of brass knuckles with a spiked facade used to tenderize meat.\nContinuing down the list, inert grenades were found tucked into a pair of sneakers in a checked bag at Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport; and then a menacing-looking pointed fidget spinner spotted in a carry-on bag at Savannah\/Hilton Head International Airport in Georgia.\nAlso on the list: A small sculpture made with inert grenades, a throwing star, a scythe, \"Satan's\" pizza cutter, a bone knife and an umbrella that looks exactly like a rifle. Topping the list was festively wrapped narcotics found in a checked bag at Los Angeles International Airport.\nSource: TSA \"Some people travel with weird stuff because they are collectors: it's an heirloom, they have ADHD [attention deficit hyperactive disorder] and it's their fidget, or they want to use the item as a training aid in a seminar,\" said Jeff Price, an aviation security expert and professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver.\nStill, \"a lot of people who don't travel frequently just don't understand that some of these items can be used as weapons,\" he said.\nPassengers even have a hard time keeping known banned items at home, with firearms being wildly popular among seized items. As of Christmas Eve, the year's tally of firearms found at airport checkpoints was close to 3,900.\nNext week, TSA officials are expected to release their official tally of firearms found in 2017, but the current number already significantly exceeds the total of 3,391 detected at airport checkpoints during 2016. The TSA reported that most gun owners claim they just \"forgot\" a firearm was in the bag they took to the airport.\nAccording to TSA spokesman Mike England, one theory behind the increase in the number of firearms and banned items could be a function of more passengers at U.S. airports.\nDuring the 2017 holiday travel period alone (Dec. 15, 2017, through Jan. 2, 2018), the TSA said it screened more than 42 million passengers and more than 30.6 million checked bags \u2014 a record. \"More passengers equals more prohibited items,\" said England.\n\u2014 Harriet Baskas is the author of seven books, including \" Hidden Treasures: What Museums Can't or Won't Show You , \" and the Stuck at the Airport blog.

A day earlier, the White House said it would suspend about $255 million in already delayed military assistance. \nTense ties between the uneasy allies nosedived on Jan. 1 when President Donald Trump lashed out on Twitter against Islamabad\u2019s \u201clies and deceit\u201d despite $33 billion in aid and the White House warned of \u201cspecific actions\u201d to pressurize Pakistan. \nA staunch U.S. Cold War ally and key player in the U.S.-backed invasion of Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Pakistan has watched warily as Washington has in recent years pivoted towards its arch-foe India. \nOver the past decade, U.S. threats to cut aid have been part and parcel of its frustrating relationship with Pakistan, a nation also seen as vital to the peace process in Afghanistan. \n\u201cAid cuts will not hurt us,\u201d Miftah Ismail, Pakistan\u2019s de facto finance minister, told Reuters. \n\u201cThat\u2019s not the leverage they have, because it is something they have reduced drastically over the years.\u201d \nPakistan received about $1 billion in U.S. assistance in 2016, down from a peak of about 3.5 billion in 2011, Pakistani and U.S. officials say. \nAbout $550 million of the 2016 total came from the Coalition Support Fund (CSF), a U.S. Defence Department program to reimburse allies for the costs of supporting counter-terrorist and counter-insurgency operations. Pakistan was the largest recipient of such funds. \nThe remaining $450 million was a mix of military assistance and funds for international non-government bodies (NGOs) and other development programs, Pakistan\u2019s finance ministry says. \nAnalysts say there are limits to how much the U.S. can fracture relations, since Pakistan cannot be isolated or completely sidelined, because of its proximity to, and influence in, Afghanistan. \n\u201cThere is really no way forward for the United States in Afghanistan without Pakistan playing some kind of cooperative and collaborative role,\u201d said Huma Yusuf, a Wilson Center Global Fellow. PART OF SOLUTION \nIslamabad worries that the United States, seeking to exert greater pressure on its ally, could in future train its crosshairs on Pakistan\u2019s fragile economy and impose some sort of financial sanctions. \nPakistani officials warn economic damage would weaken the country, proving counterproductive in Washington\u2019s battle against Islamist militant groups in South Asia. \n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how the U.S. financially or militarily hurts us and their own war effort doesn\u2019t get hurt,\u201d said Ismail, adding that it was impossible to find a solution to the Afghan conflict \u201cwithout Pakistan being part of it\u201d. \nLast year, U.S. officials said the options being discussed to push Pakistan to change its behavior included targeted sanctions of officials with ties to militant groups waging an insurgency in Afghanistan. \nThe U.S. officials have also suggested the Pentagon may ramp up drone strikes, driving Pakistani media to speculate if such air attacks would be widened beyond areas bordering Afghanistan. \nIslamabad could \u201creview its cooperation if it is not appreciated\u201d, its United Nations representative, Maleeha Lodhi, told media this week, which many interpreted as a reference to the vital transport route ferrying supplies to U.S. troops in Afghanistan through Pakistan\u2019s territory. \nPakistan remains committed to friendly relations with the United States, its powerful army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa, told Capital TV on Wednesday, but warned Washington against \u201ccoercion\u201d, and vowed not to \u201ccompromise on our self-respect\u201d. \nPakistan supported the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s as a foil to Indian influence in Afghanistan, and analysts say its military and security services maintained ties long after the Taliban regime was toppled in 2001. \nToday the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network militants are effectively an arm of Pakistan\u2019s foreign policy, U.S. officials say. Pakistan staunchly denies using proxies. \nTies with the United States are likely to stay fraught as Pakistan\u2019s strategic calculus remains unchanged, said Raoof Hassan, executive director of the Islamabad-based Regional Peace Institute. \n\u201cAs long as Pakistan continues to consider the Afghan Taliban as a strategic asset, which it can use some time in the future to become more relevant and influential in Kabul, there is no meeting point,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThe positions are diametrically opposite.\u201d Additional reporting by Saad Sayeed in ISLAMABAD and Syed Raza Hassan in KARACHI; Writing by Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Clarence Fernandez"}

Most often, that means targeting health and wellness. A Google search analysis conducted last January showed that getting healthy was the most popular resolution , with more than 62 million searches, almost double the second-most-searched New Year's resolution: getting organized. \nThe ubiquity of smartphones in daily life makes it easier than ever to make a resolution related to health \u2014 sticking to it is something else. App tracker App Annie provided CNBC with data on the most popular free versions of health and wellness apps from 2017 based on both the Apple and Android app-store downloads. The data was through Dec. 28, 2017. \nAs technology giants such as Apple, Amazon and Google get serious about remaking the health-care sector , these results show how Americans are using their phones to take more control of their health, and the specific health issues that are proving to be most app-friendly. Fitbit is still No. 1, even if its stock price doesn't show it \nFitbit 's stock may be a dog \u2014 down roughly 20 percent in 2017 and now valued at about one-fifth of its post-IPO trading debut in 2015 \u2014 but the fitness-tracking device's app remains No. 1 in the health category among free downloads. And it's collected a lot of data \u2014 by its own count, 90 billion hours of heart-rate data, 85 trillion steps, 5.4 billion nights of sleep and 167 billion minutes of exercise. In its most recent results for the third quarter 2017, Fitbit reported sales of 3.6 million devices. While that level of device sales explains why it remains No. 1 on both Apple and Android app stores, its sales numbers have trended down in recent years, which explains the stock price. \nWhile the amount of data that can be collected is impressive \u2014 and will help medical researchers , including at the National Institutes of Health \u2014 a few prominent early studies investigating how much fitness trackers improve the health of users haven't provided glowing results. \nFitbit's latest product, the Ionic smartwatch that doubles as fitness tracker, faces the daunting task of beating out the Apple Watch .

The app allows users to count their calories for free. It includes more than 5 million foods in its database, considered the app world's largest, to help just about anyone track just about anything that they are eating, in calories. Users can complete other tasks related to weight loss, such as keeping a dieting journal and compiling healthy recipes. Source: Google Play Calm \nBeing named \"App of the Year\" by Apple helped this meditation and mindfulness app created by British tech entrepreneurs Michael Acton-Smith and Alex Tew reach No. 3 among free downloads. It was downloaded at a rate of up to 30,000 per day in 2017. The Calm app includes a Sleep Stories function, which offers users the opportunity to nod off to the voice of actor Stephen Fry. Acton Smith was previously known for the tech firm Mind Candy and the gaming success Moshi Monsters, which at one point half of all British children were playing, though that business has struggled more recently. \nCalm's success \u2014 investors thought it was \"weird,\" according to Acton Smith when it debuted in 2012 \u2014 comes amid a boom in meditation and sleep practices at companies including Salesforce and Arianna Huffington's Thrive Global , as Silicon Valley and corporate America now see these lifestyle choices as keys to productivity. Walmart's Jet online shopping business launched a Wellness Shop this week. \nWhile the Calm app is free, the company offers a premium subscription, and the app also is affiliated with other products, including a Calm book and Calm Sleep Mist. Calm Flo Period and Ovulation Tracker \nThe promise of artificial intelligence includes looking at many existing health-care issues in new ways. This app makes predictions of menstruation and ovulation using machine learning. The app is more than just a monthly countdown tool, though. It can be used for contraceptives and other pill planning; to track cycles and symptoms over time; integrate menstruation with lifestyle \u2014 sleep, hydration and exercise; and of course, help women trying to conceive. \nFlo Period may be among the most popular, at No. 4 in 2017, but it's far from the only app in this niche \u2014 the paid version of competing app Period Tracker is among the five most popular paid health downloads, according to App Annie. And there are also devices on the market specifically designed to work with apps for uses including fertility. The fertility business overall has boomed and is now valued in the billions of dollars and growing. Flo Period & Ovulation Tracker Headspace \nPlaying in the same niche as Calm, Headspace offers guided meditation sessions and mindfulness training. Its co-founder, Andy Puddicombe (pictured here leading a meditation class), has become a minor meditation celebrity: He is the author of multiple books under the Headspace brand, a Ted talker and even led the Tonight Show 's band The Roots through a two-minute meditation on-air in 2017. But his flair isn't as surprising when his degree in Circus Arts from the Conservatoire of Dance and Drama in London is considered. His pre-Headspace bio also included traveling to the Himalayas to study meditation after dropping out of school and 10 years later being ordained as a Tibetan Buddhist monk. \nAt No. 5 among all free downloads in the health niche, Headspace has also had success in the corporate arena. Companies that Headspace touts as users of its tool for productivity include Google, Airbnb, Spotify, LinkedIn, Aetna, Unilever and \u2014 in an industry that probably needs stress relief measures more than many \u2014 United Airlines.

All your voice-based gadgets will work together (and may get confused) \"Because of the popularity of voice-based personal assistants, we're starting to see the technology embedded across a wide range of devices, from lamps, to TVs, to cars and beyond. In addition, after initial experiments with a single unit, many people have started putting smart speakers all over their homes. The practical net result is that sometime in 2018, a large percentage of personal assistant users will have regular access to multiple assistants simultaneously\u2014often across multiple platforms. Combine that with the fact that in 2018 we'll likely start seeing vendors enabling people to customize the trigger word for these various assistants to start listening and, well, it's a quick recipe for disaster. \u2026\n\"Don't get me wrong, I'm certainly excited about the potential that voice-based interactions can bring to speakers and all our tech devices, but I'm concerned we could hit some serious roadblocks in 2018.\" \u2014 Bob O'Donnell, president, founder and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research, a market research and consulting firm\nshow chapters Mark Cuban: AI will produce the world\u2019s first trillionaires 4:19 PM ET Fri, 21 April 2017 | 00:46 3.

Multi-part conversations, more comprehensive answers, as well as appropriate and even insightful suggestions based on what it is we're doing (or trying to do), will start to give us the sense that our devices are getting smart.

Tensions in the Middle East; crisis-stricken Venezuela's steadily falling output; and President Donald Trump 's threats to restore sanctions against Iran , OPEC's third largest producer, are some of the risks to the oil market.\nBut the third leg, investor positioning, is the one that looks wobbly to Keenan. Traders have built up \"massive\" long positions, or bets that oil prices will keep rising, while short positions \u2014 wagers that futures will fall \u2014 are \"nonexistent.\"\nHedge funds recently raised their net long positions in crude and petroleum products to records, according to Reuters. That creates the chance of a \"very dangerous\" price correction, Keenan says.\n\"There's close to a billion barrels of speculative length out there that, when it unwinds, is going to cause the price to move down,\" he said.\nSociete Generale believes Brent crude could tumble from about $70 a barrel to $62 within the first quarter of the year.\nThe most obvious catalyst is a short-term drop in demand for crude oil as refineries throttle back activity for seasonal maintenance, says Keenan. Demand for refined products, which include home heating fuel, should also ease as the United States emerges from a cold spell.\n\"That might creep into the framework in so far as the hedge funds and the speculators that are holding this position might then be suffering a little bit of an opportunity cost in their position. It's not making them any new money and they may start to get out,\" he said.\nKeenan is not the only analyst worried about the widening gap between long and short positions. Analysts earlier this month told CNBC prices look poised to fall due to the \"extreme\" positioning.\nStill, the oil market has kept rallying, drawing support this week from U.S. dollar weakness. That makes commodities sold in dollars more affordable to buyers who transact in other currencies.\nshow chapters Geopolitical tensions biggest bullish risk to oil prices: ClipperData's Matt Smith 8:43 AM ET Wed, 3 Jan 2018 | 02:52"}

That compares with a floor of 72.5 percent based on a standardized approach that global regulators agreed on in December. \n\u201cWe are strong advocates of the value of international standards in Canada but we have also never shied away from deviating from those standards where it makes sense in our domestic market,\u201d OSFI Assistant Superintendent Carolyn Rogers said at the 2018 Canadian Bank CEO conference in Toronto. \nCanada\u2019s new interim rules will be brought in ahead of the global directive. Rogers said a transition to the new rules will begin next quarter and finish in the fourth quarter of 2018. \n\u201cAs usual, Canada is going for a faster timeline,\u201d said Steve Belisle, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. \nGlobal regulators agreed on a limit on how much banks could use their own models to calculate how much risk is on their books. A 72.5 percent floor means that banks can only vary from a standard model by no more than 27.5 percent. \n\u201cFrom what I know today, the changes are going to be very acceptable, gradual and implemented over time,\u201d Scotiabank CEO Brian Porter told the conference. \nCanada\u2019s move reflects a view in North America that European banks rely too much on their own internal models to decide how much capital they should hold against their loans. U.S. banks, for example, are more constrained by a leverage ratio, which measures equity capital to total assets. \nCanada\u2019s biggest five banks -- Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce -- will each be affected by the move. \nShares in Canadian banks showed a mixed performance on Tuesday. RBC and Scotiabank shares closed up 0.5 percent, with Bank of Montreal up 0.8 percent. TD Bank shares were down 0.3 percent CIBC down 0.1 percent.

The European Commission, for example, has described it as an energy carrier with \"great potential for clean, efficient power in stationary, portable and transport applications.\"\n\nPenn State's Bruce Logan was equally optimistic. \"If we start with water, and we electrolyse water and \u2026 use some renewable energy source to do that, then we can use the hydrogen and \u2026 end up with water when we're done,\" he said. \"It's a water to water cycle and we don't need to burn all that air like we do when we burn a fossil fuel,\" he added.\nThe notion of \"green hydrogen\" is an intriguing one, but what exactly is it?\n\"It's hydrogen stemming from green sources,\" Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, secretary general of Hydrogen Europe, told \"Sustainable Energy\" earlier this year.\n\"So if you produce energy from wind or solar, turn it into electricity and then turn it into hydrogen, this is green hydrogen,\" he added.\nThe applications of hydrogen could be transformative. The DOE says that a fuel cell \u2014 which turns the chemical energy in hydrogen into electricity \u2014 combined with an electric motor is \"two to three times more efficient\" than an internal combustion engine which runs on gasoline.\n\nHydrogen is already being used in vehicles around the world. To give just one example, a fleet of hydrogen fuel cell buses is currently in operation in the Scottish city of Aberdeen.\n\nThe project means that 10 hydrogen buses are ferrying residents around the city's streets as authorities look to reduce city center emissions and boost air quality.\n\"They're a very good fit for us because we have, like many other cities \u2026 air quality issues,\" Barney Crockett, the Lord Provost of Aberdeen, told CNBC's \"Sustainable Energy\"."}

Gribbin. \nTrump, who spoke frequently about improving infrastructure in the United States during his 2016 election campaign, earlier on Tuesday in a separate meeting on immigration policy stated his desire to see an infrastructure package passed quickly. \n\u201cThe Trump Administration looks forward to working with all members of Congress who want to join us in rebuilding America,\u201d a White House official said. \nFor more on Trump\u2019s past statements on U.S. infrastructure spending, watch Fortune\u2019s video: \nRepublican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that would oversee an infrastructure bill, said the meeting was an opportunity for the administration to explain its priorities. \n\u201cThe meeting gave senators the chance to have a direct back-and-forth with administration leadership on their priorities,\u201d Barrasso said in a statement. \nSenator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the committee, praised the meeting as an opportunity to work with the administration. \n\u201cWhile there is no shortage of issues on which the president and I disagree, the kind of large scale trillion dollar infrastructure investment that then-candidate Trump talked about is something that has the potential to elicit bipartisan support here in Congress,\u201d Carper said in a statement.

By contrast, shares are largely traded on stock exchanges. \nOn the first day that the new regulations took effect, on Jan. 3, the EU\u2019s markets watchdog said trade had been glitch-free. \nBut the European Securities and Markets Authority unexpectedly delayed until March the publication of data meant to specify which stocks will be subject to limits on trading in \u201cdark pools\u201d, meaning not on public exchanges. \nWhile forex trading volumes for January are not yet available, December trading volumes showed a spurt before the MiFID II regulations kicked in. \nCurrency trading on Thomson Reuters platforms in December topped $392 billion, the highest for that month since at least 2013, as trading in derivatives soared.

AlienVault said it found evidence of malware that took over a person's computer and mined monero. The mined currency was then sent back to Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang.\nNorth Korea has been hit by sanctions from the United Nations and by countries including the U.S.\n\"Cryptocurrencies could provide a financial lifeline to a country hit hard by sanctions,\" the researchers said in a blog post. \" Therefore, it's not surprising that universities in North Korea have shown a clear interest in cryptocurrencies.\"\nThere have been other incidents of North Korean attackers mining monero. A group called Andariel took over a server at a South Korean company last year and used it to mine the cryptocurrency.\nWhat is monero? Monero is a cryptocurrency built on a different blockchain to bitcoin. The blockchain is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies.\nThese blockchains are public ledgers of activities that show all the transactions on a network. But monero's blockchain is purposely made to be more obscure. It works by obfuscating the so-called wallet addresses that people are sending monero from, making it more anonymous.\nWhy is it attractive to North Korea? The increased anonymity that the developers of monero claim exists could be a reason it has been so favored by North Korean actors.\nMonero's website also claims that it is \"safe from capital controls\" or measures that restrict the outflow of traditional currencies, much like the North Korean won. Given that sanctions have hit North Korea, monero could be an alternative currency.\nAlso, the time it takes for a monero transaction to take place is 21 minutes. For bitcoin, this rises to more than an hour and a half, and on any given day could be several hours.\nHow big is monero? Monero is the 13th largest cryptocurrency in the world with a market capitalization of $5.9 billion, according to Coinmarketcap.com, which tracks prices of cryptocurrencies.\nIt's worth noting that Coinamarketcap removed some South Korean exchanges from the way it calculates prices on its website, citing the large divergence in price in the country.

FILE PHOTO: A view shows Saudi Aramco's Abqaiq oil facility in eastern Saudi Arabia in this undated handout photo. Saudi Aramco\/Handout\/File Photo via REUTERS \nThe sale of up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco, expected to go ahead in the second half of 2018, is a centerpiece of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan to reduce the dependence of the Saudi economy on oil. The plan is championed by Saudi crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. \nThe change, which was published in a cabinet decree in the kingdom\u2019s official bulletin on Friday, is a requirement for local companies in Saudi Arabia ahead of listing, a senior Aramco source, who declined to be named, told Reuters. \n\u201cAs a customary step in the preparation process for a Saudi IPO, Saudi Aramco has converted to a joint stock company,\u201d the source said. \n\u201cThis establishes the framework to allow future investors to hold shares in the company alongside its shareholder, the government.\u201d \nBut it is an important step as it shows the IPO process, which could be the biggest in history raising up to $100 billion, is moving ahead despite market speculation it could be delayed or totally shelved. \nPrince Mohammad told Reuters in October it was still on track for 2018. \nAramco has a fully paid capital of 60 billion riyals ($16.00 billion) divided into 200 billion ordinary shares, according to the company\u2019s bylaws published in the official bulletin. \nThe firm\u2019s board will have 11 members and the power to list the company in domestic and international markets, it said. The government will propose 6 members of Aramco\u2019s board, but shareholders with a more than 0.1 percent stake will have the right to propose a member to the general assembly.

Kodak representive Paige English snaps a photo using Kodak's Printomatic instaprint camera at the Kodak booth during CES 2018 at the Las Vegas Convention Center on January 9, 2018 in Las Vegas, Nevada. David Becker Getty Images By Sarit Markovich January 12, 2018 \nCan Kodak, best known these days as a textbook case of failing to adjust to the Digital Age, make the ultimate comeback? \nThat\u2019s the question raised by the company\u2019s recent debut of KodakCoin and a digital platform for storage, authentication, and rights-management of photographs\u2014a foray into the surging domains of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. \nOn one hand, the move seems to represent a stark contrast to the Kodak of old, which stood by and watched Fuji and other competitors capitalize on the advent of digital photos while its own revenue and share of the photography market imploded. Investors have rewarded the move by tripling Kodak\u2019s stock price . On the other, critics have argued that Kodak\u2019s new strategy, while attention-grabbing, creates little real value. In reality, it\u2019s too early to tell. \nKodak\u2019s strategy could create value\u2014but it depends on how well the iconic business deploys the new products and services, and the reactions of their target market and competitors. \nLet\u2019s consider these dynamics for the related offerings in question: one platform for photo storage and rights management, along with payment\/transaction management; and the initial coin offering (ICO) for KodakCoin. Rights-management platform \nKodak (KODK) wants to attract photographers with a platform that will not only house their pictures, but protect them from unauthorized use. The company is even touting technology that will search proactively for infringement through \u201c continual web-crawling \u201d and alert users. There is large potential value here, as this solves mounting rights-related problems for photographers. \nThe caveat: The Kodak technology has to work as promised. Will it be superior to current means of rights protection, such as digital watermarks? How well will the technology crawl the web to spot rights-infringement? This requires strong image-processing technology to identify identical or similar images. If done well, it will likely become a go-to platform for photographers, creating value for all parties. Platform-based transactions \nBeyond protecting the rights to pictures, Kodak wants to enable photographers\u2014small sellers\u2014to transact with customers on the same platform that houses their images, rather than through outside payment processors such as Paypal (PYPL) or Venmo. In theory, that would afford users greater convenience\u2014one-stop transactions\u2014while providing Kodak valuable control over more user activities, along with a trove of usable data. \nFor example, the business could study transactions to identify more popular, higher-volume photographers or field of photography and target them with specific products (cameras and lenses), services, and offers. But again, Kodak has to offer something superior than what\u2019s already out there. In this case, that means free (like Venmo), protected (like Paypal), convenient (like Paypal and Venmo) transactions for users. That\u2019s challenging to do profitably \u2014will Kodak pick up fees to credit-card-based funds onto the platform, for example? Will Kodak be liable for transferred funds that were not rewarded with a satisfying product? \nKodakCoin \nWith the end-of-January ICO of KodakCoin , the business is entering the cryptocurrency domain, a market all over the headlines, but already dominated by Bitcoin and others. Why is Kodak making this move? One argument is that it\u2019s a cheap way to access capital\u2014something Kodak may not be able to do easily from traditional investors these days. Beyond generating cash, the strategy can provide incentive for buyers of the new currency to be the early adopters of the Kodak platform: The more users of the platform (photographers and customers), the more KodakCoin users there are, and thus the greater the value of both. \nBut new online platforms\u2014and cryptocurrencies, for that matter\u2014always face a Catch-22: They can\u2019t grow without users, and it\u2019s hard to get lots of users without a critical mass of them in the first place. The ICO could act to motivate those who\u2019ve already invested in the platform to act as ambassadors of the Kodak brand, and thus of KodakCoin. But Kodak is likely betting that (1) any success with the cryptocurrency won\u2019t be based on a mounting \u201cBitcoin bubble,\u201d resulting in devaluation of the coin, and thus large, near-term losses for Kodak and the investors, and (2) players like Fuji won\u2019t enter the market with a better platform or currency offerings. That may be a substantial bet, whatever the currency it\u2019s made with. \nAs suggested earlier, despite all the prognostication about Kodak\u2019s new crypto strategy, it\u2019s hard to say exactly what will happen. But analysis of the new offerings and their context suggests that Kodak could drive value with them. The business just has to remember that \u201cfirst announcer\u201d of a new platform doesn\u2019t necessarily get first-mover advantages and network effects. Those usually go to an early player with the highest-quality offerings. \nSarit Markovich is clinical associate professor of strategy at The Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he was developing a plan to restructure the state\u2019s payroll tax system. \nCalifornia and other states with high income and property taxes are scrambling to deal with the $10,000 federal deduction cap imposed by the sweeping tax overhaul bill passed by congressional Republicans and signed into law last month by President Donald Trump. \n\u201cThe Republican tax plan gives corporations and hedge-fund managers a trillion-dollar tax cut and expects California taxpayers to foot the bill,\u201d de Le\u00f3n said in a statement. \u201cWe won\u2019t allow California residents to be the casualty of this disastrous tax scheme.\u201d \nAbout 6 million California taxpayers, a third of the total, itemized deductions on their tax returns, claiming an average of $18,438 for state and local taxes, according to a fact sheet on the legislation. \nThe excellence fund would be created by the proposed legislation and exist within the state\u2019s general fund, according to de Leon\u2019s office. The bill did not provide details on how money in the fund would be used. \nBecause states are not registered as charities, their tax codes would have to be modified for them to be considered charitable organizations, said Joseph Callahan, a lawyer with Mackay, Caswell & Callahan in New York. \n\u201cI\u2019m scratching my head at how that would work,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom (a U.S. Internal Revenue Service) perspective, it is against public policy; it is against the intention of the Congress.\u201d \nAn IRS spokesman on Friday declined to comment on the California bill. \nThe bill\u2019s fact sheet said California and other states had created tax credit programs to fund access to college and private education. \nWhite House economic adviser Gary Cohn said the federal government might try to block attempts to circumvent the cap, Bloomberg reported on Friday. \nThe California proposal is modeled after an existing tax credit offered for contributions to the CalGrant program that provides college scholarships.

Such a turn of events between the two major powers would have global implications, he added, pointing to how it would affect worldwide trade and investment. \nOutlining the two likely scenarios that could play out, Roche said the U.S. may try to contain North Korea by having \"rings of missiles throughout the Asia Pacific region pointing at Pyongyang\" or it could try to remove the hermit nation's leader Kim Jong Un through an attack. \nBoth those scenarios undermine China's influence \u2014 they would remove a key strategic ally from Beijing's foreign policy plan \u2014 and would lead to an \"almost inevitable cold war\" between China and the U.S., he said. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping leave after an opera performance at the Forbidden City in Beijing, China, November 8, 2017. \n\"One of these two outcomes is pretty likely so what comes out of that is all sorts of things: trade complications, cold wars et cetera. And that, I think, would be a major geopolitical forecast I would make for this year,\" said Roche. \nKim declared North Korea \"a peace-loving and responsible nuclear power\" in his annual New Year's Day address on Monday, Reuters reported. The leader also said the U.S. should be aware that his country's nuclear forces are now a reality, not a threat, but claimed that he was \"open to dialogue\" with the South. \nPyongyang's testing of its nuclear weapons escalated tensions throughout 2017 and brewed fiery rhetoric between Trump and Kim. But other than some knee-jerk reactions, financial markets mostly shrugged off those developments. \nRoche said it is hard to predict how Trump will react to Kim's latest declaration, but any actions by the U.S. will hit equities more than other asset classes. \n\"The major casualty out of this would be equities because equities are now based upon such optimism that any really negative impact will affect the most high-flown asset,\" he said."}

But U.S. inflation has been weak for years, while stocks have been surging. \nRealized losses in the Commodity Strategy Fund have totaled $3.26 billion since 2012, according to its financial statements. In that time, energy prices collapsed, gold and silver prices declined, and bouts of excess supply plagued the coffee and sugar markets, according to Fidelity\u2019s disclosures. The fund invests in futures contracts that cover commodities such as hogs, oil and wheat, as well as swaps with counterparties such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co, according to U.S. regulatory filings. \nEven with the commodity funds\u2019 losses, returns for Freedom Funds, which dial down risk as investors approach their estimated target date for retirement, exceeded those of more than 90 percent of peers because of larger, winning bets on stocks, according to three-year performance data from research firm Morningstar Inc. \nFidelity\u2019s allocation to commodities in the Freedom Funds is $4 billion, or nearly 2 percent of $224 billion in net assets. That is down from highs of $12 billion and up to 10 percent of assets in some of the most aggressive Freedom Fund portfolios in 2013. \nMorningstar analyst Jeff Holt said some managers of target-date retirement funds had lost patience with their commodities bets. \n\u201cWe\u2019re in a multiyear bull market for equities, and diversification from that doesn\u2019t look that great,\u201d Holt said. \nFidelity said in a statement that it was sticking with its commodities strategy as its portfolio managers take a long-term view. \n\u201cThe target date team has confidence in all of the investment strategies that are included in the portfolios,\u201d the company said. \nAnd the tide could be turning for commodities. The commodity fund eked out a 0.92 percent gain in 2017 as energy prices rallied during the second half of the year. Oil rose to its highest since May 2015 on Thursday, helped by large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded as high as $68.27. \nUnlike Fidelity, target-date portfolios managed by T. Rowe Price Group Inc use a fund with no direct exposure to commodities. Instead of investing in futures contracts like the Fidelity commodity fund does, T. Rowe primarily buys shares of publicly traded companies that own or are involved in natural resources, precious metals or real estate, spokesman Bill Weeks said. \nThe surging stock market is one reason why the $3.3 billion T. Rowe Real Assets Fund has generated an average annual return of 3.07 percent over the past five years, compared with average annual losses of 9.07 percent for Fidelity\u2019s commodity fund, according to Morningstar. \nVanguard Group, the largest target-date fund provider, does not invest in commodities for those retirement portfolios. The increased costs and complexity associated with commodities outweigh their benefits, said Senior Investment Analyst Scott Donaldson. \n\u201cPeople may think because they own commodities, they own barrels of oil and bushels of wheat,\u201d Donaldson said. \u201cBut what they really own are financial derivatives. These can be complex, confusing and expensive.\u201d (Reporting by Tim McLaughlin; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)"}

Advanced Micro Devices will likely get a share of the riches, according to MKM Partners analyst Ruben Roy.\nRoy has turned more bullish on AMD on the calculation investors have yet to price in a boost from the cryptocurrency markets. The chipmaker is scheduled to report earnings after Tuesday's closing bell.\n\"The near-term numbers both for December and the guide for March are going to be quite good,\" Roy told CNBC's \" Trading Nation \" on Monday. \"I think the setup for crypto is quite good.\"\nRecent channel checks by MKM suggest strong demand for processing chips, especially graphics chips, used in cryptocurrency mining. Chipmakers such as AMD and Nvidia have seen increased sales of high-powered chips in recent years as cryptocurrency mining and trading have grown in popularity. Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum, at least doubled their price in the fourth quarter.\nMKM Partners expects a nearly 14 percent quarter-on-quarter decline in AMD sales, a shallower drop than previously expected and slightly higher than consensus. Earnings estimates of 5 cents a share are in line with consensus \u2014 it would mark the company's third straight quarter of profitability, its best streak since 2014.\nIn a note Monday, Roy also hiked the company's fair value estimate to $14.50 a share from $13 and increased earnings estimates through to 2019. A $14.50 price target implies 9 percent upside for AMD from Monday's close. For 2019, Roy anticipates 45 percent earnings growth and a 10 percent sales increase on 2018 estimates.\nRoy still has his reservations on the stock, though. He maintains a neutral rating on AMD shares and said his view would change when he sees the company taking a larger chunk of market share. AMD's market share is little changed even after introducing Ryzen, a new brand of central processing units, and its Vega graphics processing unit chips last year, said Roy.\n\"From a longer term perspective what it will take for us to get more positive on the stock, I think we need to see AMD take some of these new products that I mentioned and start to get some meaningful market share,\" he said.\nMKM Partners' estimates are largely in line with its peers. Most brokerage firms surveyed by FactSet have a hold rating on AMD shares with an average target price of $14.23. Rosenblatt Securities holds the highest price target at $22, while Morningstar Equity Research has the lowest at $9.\nAMD shares were down slight in Tuesday's premarket, trading at $13.24. On Monday, they were sharply higher for the second session in a row, adding to its already steep ascent this year. Its shares have risen nearly 30 percent in January \u2014 more than four times the gains on the S&P 500 . AMD is the best performer on the SMH semiconductor ETF , bypassing major competitor Nvidia .\nAMD's 2018 gains are a welcome rebound after a weak back half to 2017.

It is deplorable for anyone to find themselves in this situation.\" \nWynn blamed his ex-wife Elaine for stirring up trouble. The couple is currently in the middle of a lawsuit. But Ralston said the Journal more likely began an investigation because of the current political environment and things like the #MeToo movement, Ralston said. \n\"The divorce certainly is nasty,\" Ralston said. \"There certainly is no love lost between the two of them. But here is what I do know. In this new atmosphere of sexual harassment being a big deal in the political, social consciousness of this country, the Wall Street Journal started working on pieces just as we have and many other news organizations have. There have always been rumors about sexual harassment in the context of the casino business. My guess is they started working on this story based on that. Not based on being fed information by Elaine Wynn.\" \nThe Journal did not respond to a request for comment. In its story, the Journal said it contacted more than 150 past and present employees and found dozens that told stories of sexual misconduct. Many people who spoke said they were worried talking to the media would hurt future job prospects because Wynn is so well-connected in Las Vegas. \n\"Some of these kinds of rumors or allegations have been out there before,\" Ralston said, referencing the Nevada Independent columnist John L. Smith who wrote a book that alluded to \"some of this stuff.\" \n\"It's going to be very, very difficult for him to get away from that [Wall Street Journal article] even though he has said he never assaulted a woman,\" Ralston said.

He will remain with the company as executive chairman and plans to oversee innovation once a new CEO is selected. \nPreviously, the chain had launched several initiatives to revitalize the brand, including a refreshed advertising campaign, a nationwide rollout of queso dip, and testing new items, such as salads and desserts.

She said there's a deep malaise surrounding the lack of public offerings last year, a higher bar for IPOs and a lack of contenders that are far enough along in terms of revenue and partnerships. \nKjellson polled the audience at this week's conference to name a single start-up that could file in the next two quarters.\n\"An audience member said they may have one, but otherwise the room was crickets,\" she said.\nInvestors said digital health companies considering an IPO need about $100 million in annual recurring revenue, and the vast majority aren't there.\n\"The public market wants to see three to four quarters of predictable sales and ideally moving towards or at profitability,\" said Canaan's Julie Papanek. \"Very few companies are pacing like that right now.\"\nIt's all about M&A However, there are plenty of opportunities to get acquired.\n\"M&A is the new IPO,\" said Bill Evans, Rock Health's managing director, who closely tracks the industry. \nBut who will be the buyers of digital health companies in 2018?\nSome investors are betting on big pharma.

South Korea\u2019s chief financial regulator last week said the government may consider shutting down domestic virtual currency exchanges. \nSouth Korea\u2019s Presidential office has clarified that an outright ban on trading on the virtual currency exchanges is only one of the steps being considered, and not a measure that has been finalized. \n\u201cThe government is still discussing whether an outright ban is needed or not, internally,\u201d a government official who declined to be named said after Tuesday\u2019s briefing. \nOver the past month, government statements have underscored differences between the Justice Ministry, which has pushed for a more hardline approach, and regulators who have shown a reluctance to enforce an outright ban. \nStarting Jan. 30, cryptocurrency traders in South Korea will not be allowed to make deposits into their virtual currency exchange wallets unless the names on their bank accounts matches the account name in cryptocurrency exchanges, Kim Yong-beom, vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission told a news conference in Seoul. \n\u201cEveryone knew this was coming, as the government already said they will enforce the real-name system before. Rather, I can see this as a chance to go in, not out. I don\u2019t see any reason to take my money out,\u201d said a local bitcoin investor who only agreed to be identified by his family name Ahn. \nThe regulator has previously said it will come up with detailed guidelines for local banks to properly identify its clients by their real names in cryptocurrency transactions. \nTo make deposits into virtual coin wallets, cryptocurrency traders will need to identify themselves with their real names at the exchange and have those matched with information at local banks by Jan. 30.

In fact, when Jeff Bezos started the company as an online bookseller in 1994, the fledgling business was running on money from Bezos' parents' life savings . \nBezos had to be frugal. So when Amazon's then-handful of employees needed desks, the entrepreneur found a cheap solution \u2014 he hacked them together himself with a door as the desktop and four-by-fours for legs. \nThese days, Amazon has a $650 billion market cap and CEO Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world. He owns a mansion in the same neighborhood as Barack Obama and Ivanka Trump, flies in a private jet and launched Blue Origin to pursue space travel. \nBut the self-made billionaire keeps a token reminder about the importance of pinching pennies. Bezos' current desk at his Amazon office is still made out of a wooden door for the top and four pieces of wood for legs, according to a company spokesperson. \nIt's a more modern variation of the one he had back in the 90s, when Amazon's headquarters shared a block with a pawn shop and a heroin-needle exchange in Seattle. But for Bezos, the desk represents the frugal mindset he's held since the company's start, when he built that very first desk. \n\"We happened to be across the street from a Home Depot,\" Nico Lovejoy, the fifth employee of Amazon says, telling the story of how the desks came to be in an Amazon blog post . \"[Bezos] looked at desks for sale and looked at doors for sale, and the doors were a lot cheaper, so he decided to buy a door and put some legs on it.\" \nIn 1999, Amazon was a public company, and Jeff Bezos was a billionaire, holding roughly $10 billion in Amazon stock, according to The New York Times . Still, the company was using desks made of doors. \nThat year, Bezos told CBS's Bob Simon in a profile for for \" 60 Minutes ,\" the office space and door desks were to demonstrate an important value for the business. \n\"It's a symbol of spending money on things that matter to customers and not spending money on things that don't,\" Bezos explains to Simon. Rex Rystedt | Getty Images Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos sitting on stack of warehouse shipping cartons in 2000. \nToday, an upgraded version of the door desks are still used by employees in both corporate roles and in fulfillment centers, an Amazon spokesperson says. And frugality remains one of Amazon's leadership principles. \n\"Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention,\" reads an Amazon leadership principle listed on its website. \nBezos even uses the desk as a symbol to recognize employees who come up with cost-saving ideas at Amazon'sall-hands meetings, by presenting them with a miniature desk that he's signed, called the \"Door Desk Award.\" Most recently, the award went to three employees who had an idea to use gift bags instead of gift wrap for presents, saving Amazon millions of dollars, according to the company. \nTo inspire others, anyone can even build their own door desk in six steps . \nAs for the original desks that Bezos himself made, \"They were pretty wobbly,\" Lovejoy says . \"You would never want to hire Jeff Bezos as a carpenter. \n\"He's much better at other things. I think he'd tell you the same thing.\" "}

Palestinian teen Ahed Tamimi (R) enters a military courtroom escorted by Israeli Prison Service personnel at Ofer Prison, near the West Bank city of Ramallah, January 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Ammar Awad \nJustifying the ban, authorities in the Southeast Asian city state said the film \u201cRadiance of Resistance\u201d was \u201cskewed\u201d and potentially divisive for Singapore\u2019s multi-ethnic population. \nThe documentary, which looks at the Palestine-Israeli conflict through the eyes of 16-year-old Ahed Tamimi and another young female activist, lacked \u201ccounterbalance\u201d, the Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA) said on its website. \n\u201cThe skewed narrative of the film is inflammatory and has the potential to cause disharmony amongst the different races and religions in Singapore,\u201d the IMDA said. \nThe documentary was due to have been shown at the Singapore Palestinian Film Festival on Thursday. \nIt was screened at a number of festivals worldwide in 2017 and won Best Documentary at the Respect Human Rights Film Festival in Belfast, but has become even more topical following Tamimi\u2019s arrest last month. \nTamimi was charged on Monday with counts of aggravated assault and will be tried in an Israeli military court. An adult found guilty of assaulting a soldier could be jailed for up to 10 years, but Tamimi is a minor so such an outcome is unlikely. \nWhile Singapore\u2019s authorities are known to keep a tight rein on public speech and the media, especially when it comes to matters related to race and religion, outright bans are more rare. \nAdela Foo, the organizer of the Singapore festival, called the ban \u201cunderstandable\u201d, without elaborating. \n\u201cAt the end of the day, the IMDA\u2019s position is one to be respected,\u201d the 23-year-old student told Reuters. \nWith a sizable Muslim minority and surrounded by Muslim majority neighbors where sympathy for the Palestinian cause runs high, Singapore maintains friendly diplomatic and military ties with Israel. But it has lined up with many other countries opposed to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. \nAround 15 percent of Singapore\u2019s 3.3 million resident population aged 15 years and over identify as Muslim, recent government surveys show.

He's expected to tell the assembled world leaders and CEOs why his \"America First\" policies aren't a bad thing for the rest of the world.\nBut it will fail if he attempts to make this case on political grounds or based on the argument that the U.S. has been shafted by international trade deals. This is the World Economic Forum, after all. What this speech and the Davos elites need to hear is a healthy dose of economic wisdom.\nLuckily, there just so happens to be a wealth of easily-delivered economic wisdom that justifies the core of the president's message. And it comes from a Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman . His work provides all the respectable reasoning needed to explain that the world needs more self-interested competition, not less.\nFriedman's soft spoken tone, modest lifestyle, and professorial stature are all the perfect foil right now to Trump's bluster and the jet-setting super rich image of people like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. That's important because it's the president's persona that remains a key stumbling block for him among several top business leaders who praise his policies, but otherwise seek to distance themselves from him.\nThere's no public evidence Trump is a student or a fan of Friedman's direct teachings. Also, Friedman was an opponent of just about any form of trade protectionism. But before Friedman died in 2006, he also came to see NAFTA as terrible deal and distrusted supranational institutions like the IMF and the United Nations. That's where his and Trump's messages jibe the most. So this would be the time for the president and his team to bone up on Friedman's wisdom and use it in this perfect venue.\nHere are the two key Friedman Quote: s Trump can use to support his own stance on the global economy:\n1. \"Self-interest is not myopic selfishness. It is whatever it is that interests the participants, whatever they value, whatever goals they pursue. The scientist seeking to advance the frontiers of his discipline\u2026 the philanthropist seeking to bring comfort to the needy \u2013 all are pursuing their interests, as they see them, as they judge them by their own values.\"\n(Milton and Rose Friedman, Free to Choose , published 1979)\nThis is the most important \"truth bomb\" Trump should drop right away. Davos is brimming with the kinds of globalists who created the European Union and treated economic independence movements like the U.K.'s Brexit vote like Armageddon. It doesn't mean constructs like the E.U. don't have their economic benefits, but the idea that an entire world region needs to have all its economic boats sailing in the same direction was always questionable at best.\nWhite House senior economic advisor Gary Cohn summarized this by saying that \"America first is not America alone.\" America is looking to compete, but still compete on a fair playing field with the rest of the world. Whether it's the E.U. or multinational trade deals like NAFTA or the TPP, every nation deserves the right to examine all its competitive self-interests before joining or staying in them.\n2. \"It is tempting to believe that social evils arise from the activities of evil men and that if only good men (like ourselves, naturally) wielded power, all would be well... To understand why it is that 'good' men in positions of power will produce evil, while ordinary man without power but able to engage in voluntary cooperation with his neighbors will produce good, requires analysis and thought, subordinating the emotions to the rational faculty .\"\n(Milton Friedman, International Herald Tribune, 1994)\nDavos is filled with billionaires, but it isn't really a celebration of wealth. It's a celebration of power, and the belief that concentrating corporate and political power in one place like Davos will produce great results. The Davos elites need to be reminded they may not have enough good answers to justify their real or imagined power.\nTrump has been doing himself a favor lately by throwing off much of the populist rhetoric he used during the campaign. And populist guru Steve Bannon is not only out of the White House, but clearly out of favor .\nThere is one vestige of populism Trump should cling to even at Davos: the idea that the richest and most powerful people in the world aren't always right. It says something about Davos that a very rich and suddenly very powerful person like Trump is only now important enough to make an appearance there. That outsider status gives him the perfect opportunity to deliver the kind of \"out of the box\" message needed atop that Swiss mountain right now.\nProvided Trump acknowledges that his message is rooted in the respected teaching of a source like Friedman, the elites at Davos might even listen.\nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.
